Greg Abbott.

""Prayers answered"" Abbott wrote. ""All hostages are out alive and safe.""

Not long before the governor's message a loud bang and the sound of gunfire were heard at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville near Fort Worth as authorities worked to free the hostages The Associated Press reported.

""The subject is deceased"" Colleyville police Chief Michael Miller told reporters at a news conference around 11:20 p.m. ET. The identity of the hostage taker was not being immediately released.

Miller said authorities didn't yet know why the suspect selected Congregation Beth Israel for the crime.

The FBI said the suspect was focused on a single issue not directly related to the Jewish community The Associated Press reported.

More than 200 law enforcement officers had worked on the case Saturday including hostage-situation negotiators authorities added.

Just about two hours earlier a single hostage had been freed unharmed giving authorities hope that the situation would end without a bloodshed.

Authorities and others were worried about a repeat of such tragedies as the Tree of Life massacre in Pittsburgh in October 2018 where 11 people were killed or the Poway California synagogue shooting near San Diego in 2019 where there was one fatality.

How it began

Many hours earlier a Texas SWAT team had responded to Congregation Beth Israel after a suspect entered the house of worship and took hostages during services that were being live-streamed on the Internet.

The suspect was said to be a supporter of Aafia Siddiqui a Pakistani neuroscientist who was sentenced to 86 years in prison in 2010 for attempting to murder and assault U.S. military personnel and was being held at Federal Medical Center Carswell at a prison in Fort Worth.

Siddiqui is also referred to as ""Lady al Qaeda.""

As the situation began Colleyville police wrote on Twitter that all residents in the immediate area of the synagogue were being evacuated.

Police posted an additional update at 1:20 p.m. stating the situation was ongoing and advised people to avoid the area.

According to ABC News the hostages included the rabbi of the synagogue. He was identified by the Dallas Morning News as Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker.

In a statement Colleyville Police Department Sgt. Dara Nelson said the department received the first call at 10:41 a.m.

As the day progressed Colleyville police the FBI’s Dallas Field Office the Texas Department of Public Safety North Tarrant Regional SWAT Team and other agencies responded to the scene.

Law enforcement officials said no injuries were reported and that FBI crisis negotiators had been in communication with the suspect throughout the ordeal.

The first hostage was released with no injuries shortly after 5 p.m. CT according to Nelson.

""This man will be reunited with his family as soon as possible and he does not require medical attention"" the sergeant said.

Livestream: ‘I am going to die. OK?’

The congregation had a Facebook livestream up on its Facebook page for a service that had started three hours prior to the suspect's arrival.

The livestream was soon disabled but not before a man could be heard repeatedly saying ""I will die.""

""I'm going to die at the end of this alright? Are you listening? I am going to die. OK? So don't cry for me"" the voice said.

Earlier in the livestream the man who was not visible could be heard in what appeared to be a discussion with negotiators about ""releasing"" the people inside.

A spokesperson for Meta the parent company of Facebook told Fox News Digital that the company ended the livestream and would also remove any content praising the incident.

""We are in contact with law enforcement as the situation continues to evolve"" the spokesperson added.

Cytron-Walker the rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel has been in his position since 2006 according to the congregation's website.

The synagogue describes itself as an ""intimate vibrant growing Reform Jewish congregation that has a lot to offer in terms of religious social and educational opportunities for the youngest to our oldest members.""

Reactions in DC and elsewhere

A White House official told Fox News that officials there were ""closely monitoring"" the situation.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams said on Twitter that ""out of an abundance of caution"" the New York Police Department ""has deployed additional resources to key Jewish locations around the city tonight.""

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides tweeted about the incident.

""I am closely monitoring reports of the hostage situation at Congregation Beth Israel in Texas where the community is gathered for Shabbat services. Praying for an immediate and safe end.""

Big pharmaceutical companies usually make big bucks. And many of them return a portion of their profits to investors in the form of dividends.

We asked three Motley Fool contributors to pick the pharma stocks that they think have especially juicy dividends. Here's why they chose AbbVie (ABBV -0.65%) Gilead Sciences (GILD 1.17%) and Pfizer (PFE 1.26%).

A Dividend Aristocrat that's performing well

Keith Speights (AbbVie): There's so much to like about AbbVie's dividend that it's hard to know where to begin. But I'll start with its attractive yield of 4.2%. What's even better though is that AbbVie is a Dividend Aristocrat -- an elite group of S&P 500 members that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.

Unlike some dividend stocks AbbVie has also delivered strong growth lately. Its shares soared 26% last year. With dividends included the drugmaker's total return easily beat the S&P 500's performance.

There are a couple of concerns for AbbVie though. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently placed additional warnings on the company's JAK inhibitor Rinvoq. This could limit the sales of the drug to some extent. Also AbbVie's top-selling drug Humira faces biosimilar rivals in the U.S. beginning in 2023. Sales are expected to decline significantly.

However AbbVie's dividend shouldn't be threatened at all. The company could also continue generating solid growth in the second half of this decade after the initial impact of Humira losing exclusivity. AbbVie has several other growth drivers including autoimmune disease drug Skyrizi and blood cancer drug Venclexta.

This biotech has boosted its dividend 51% in five years

David Jagielski (Gilead Sciences): Investing in a high-yielding dividend stock can be a great way to make the most of your money. But to ensure that inflation isn't chipping away at that cash flow over time you'll also want to invest in a company that raises its dividend payments. With Gilead Sciences investors are getting the best of both worlds -- a high yield of around 4% that has also been growing over the years.

Five years ago Gilead was paying its investors a quarterly dividend of $0.47. Today those payments are up to $0.71 rising by 51% during that time and averaging a compound annual growth rate of 8.6%. And that already-juicy dividend can get even more mouth-watering as the company's payout ratio sits below 50%.

In Gilead's latest quarterly update sales rose 13% year over year to $7.4 billion. The company also reported net income of $2.6 billion which equated to a per-share (diluted) profit of $2.05. And in the nine months leading up to that date the earnings per share (EPS) topped $4.63. That's easily enough to cover the current dividend which on an annual basis would total $2.84. And it leaves room for some generous increases as well.

Now may be an optimal time to buy Gilead stock. The company typically reports its fourth-quarter earnings in early February. Gilead could announce another dividend hike then as well. Since 2015 when the company began making dividend payments Gilead has consistently raised its payouts each subsequent year (and normally in February).

With solid financials and the company likely to continue receiving a boost from its COVID-19 treatment Veklury it's probable that this dividend could get even juicier than it already is today.

A cash cow with a stable dividend

Prosper Junior Bakiny (Pfizer): When it comes to dividend stocks high yields are great but the ability to sustain dividend increases is even better. That's what pharma giant Pfizer provides. The company's current yield of 2.75% is well above the S&P 500's average of 1.27%. But just as important is Pfizer's very conservative cash payout ratio of 29.64%. For context a payout ratio below the 60% range is generally considered good.

This implies that Pfizer has considerable room to sustain dividend increases in large part thanks to the cash it has been generating over the past year. Pfizer's free cash flow soared by 126.1% to $29.2 billion in the trailing twelve-month period. We can attribute that primarily to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty. This vaccine has become a blockbuster product -- and then some -- in its first year on the market.

Pfizer said it would generate $36 billion from Comirnaty in the fiscal year 2021. Given recent developments surrounding the pandemic 2022 should be another excellent year for the vaccine. Management thinks sales of Comirnaty could come in at $29 billion this year. Pfizer's coronavirus-related business alone which includes Comirnaty and Paxlovid a COVID-19 therapy that recently earned authorization will generate more sales than dozens of large corporations will this year.

But Pfizer has other tools at its disposal. The company's anticoagulant Eliquis cancer medicine Xtandi as well as its biosimilar business are meaningfully contributing to its overall performance. Even immunosuppressant Xeljanz could return to growth this year despite the regulatory headwinds it encountered last year.

Lastly Pfizer's pipeline includes 29 ongoing phase 3 clinical trials. Expect new products and label expansions to strengthen an already solid lineup.

And all of this at a reasonable price too. Pfizer is trading at just 9.1 times forward earnings compared to an average price-to-earnings ratio of 13.3 for the pharma industry.

In short Pfizer provides a little bit of everything most investors look for: high growth reasonable value and stable income in the form of dividends. Too juicy to pass up indeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbGVnYWN5LnN1bnRpbWVzLmNvbS91cy9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2NoaWNhZ29zdW50aW1lcy9uYW1lL2FsYW4tZ29yZG9uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyMjU1MDM30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alan Gordon Obituary (2022) - Deerfield IL - Chicago Sun-Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://legacy.suntimes.com/us/obituaries/chicagosuntimes/name/alan-gordon-obituary?id=32255037 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbGVnYWN5LnN1bnRpbWVzLmNvbS91cy9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2NoaWNhZ29zdW50aW1lcy9uYW1lL2FsYW4tZ29yZG9uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyMjU1MDM30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBoYXJtYWxldHRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS91cy1mZGEtZ3JlZW4tbGlnaHRzLXR3by1qYWstaW5oaWJpdG9ycy1mb3ItYXRvcGljLWRlcm1hdGl0aXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US FDA green lights two JAK inhibitors for atopic dermatitis,"Having cast a shadow over the safety of the JAK inhibitor class of drugs in September last year and delayed clearance of new drugs on Friday the US Food and Drug Administration approved not one but two new medicines in the category: Pfizer’s (NYSE: PFE) Cibinqo (abrocitinib) and AbbVie’s (NYSE: ABBV) Rinvoq (upadacitinib).

Hackers often use links sent through emails to try and entice users into clicking on them after which their credentials would be harvested.Most people know not to click on links that have been sent by people that they are not all that familiar with. In fact ATP protection makes it so that these phishing emails often don’t even get to your inbox in the first place. With all of that having been said and now out of the way it is important to note that hackers are now using official Adobe emails to try and hack into people’s systems and harvest their credentials as reported by Avanan They do this by creating an account with Adobe Cloud Suite and sending emails through it that would contain PDFs. This PDF will contain a link to a page that will harvest credentials and sending the email through Adobe Cloud Suite helps the email bypass any protections that you may have put in place since Adobe would most likely be considered a trusted sender by your email provider and that might lull you into a false sense of security as well.This just goes to show how risky it is to click on links that you receive via email. Even if you have received an email through an official channel it would be best if you were really careful before clicking on that link with all things having been considered and taken into account. Also if you do end up clicking on the link perform a few checks to ensure that any information you enter would remain secure.Read next: Cyber attacks still on rise despite majority of the world currently working from home,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vY3JlYXRpdmVwcm8uY29tL3VzaW5nLXRoZS13aWR0aC10b29sLWluLWlsbHVzdHJhdG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using the Width Tool in Illustrator | CreativePro Network,"Using the Width Tool in Illustrator

In recent CreativePro articles you learned about the many options available to customize strokes. We covered the Stroke panel in detail for controlling a stroke’s weight ends and gaps for creating dots or dashes. In another article you learned about the Paintbrush tool which produces complex stroke appearances that can look like patterns objects pen marks or paint brushstrokes. There’s one more tool in Illustrator’s arsenal for editing your strokes: The Width tool.

Starting Out with a Stroked Path

Draw a path on your artboard with your favorite tool – it can be a shape or a freehand path made with the Pencil or Pen. Set the path’s stroke to a value greater than zero.

It’s helpful to have the Control bar showing by choosing Window > Control and to show the Stroke panel; Choose Window > Stroke if necessary.

I used my drawing tablet to write this word with the stroke set to 5 pt.

Editing the Width along a Path

Select the Width tool in the toolbar or type Shift+W to activate it.

Hover over your path and notice the + symbol alongside the cursor. Click and drag in a perpendicular direction outward away from the path or inward toward it. When you release you’ll have added a width point and changed the weight of your path segment. Dragging outward makes the path bulge inward makes it taper. Notice how Illustrator eases the transition from the original weight to the width you set at the new point.

Place additional width points by clicking and dragging anywhere on the path including on existing anchor points and the ends.

When you hover over the end of a path width anchors appear at the outer edges of the stroke even before you click. You may have to zoom in close to see them. You can click and drag these width anchors directly to edit the path’s terminus. You can even taper the end all the way down to a point as see in the center of this spiral path:

By default when using the Width tool to modify a stroke the width is altered by the same amount to either side of the path. Hold down the Option/Alt key to drag a handle at either end of a width point to adjust that side only.

Width points have smaller diamond-shaped anchors to distinguish them from regular square path anchors. Click and drag the center anchor of a width point or between its anchors to reposition it along the path. Width points cannot cross over each other when repositioned. Hold down Option/Alt while dragging a width point along the path to duplicate it. You can press Delete (or Forward Delete) on your keyboard to remove a width point.

When you have Smart Guides turned on (View > Smart Guides) hovering over a width point displays its values as shown above.

Double-clicking a width point brings up the Width Point Edit dialog box where you can precisely edit widths on either side of the path and choose whether to adjust nearby width points to ease the transitions. As you work in the Width Options dialog box your changes update immediately on the selected path.

Saving the Stroke Profile

As you add move and modify width points along a path you’re changing the stroke’s profile. You can see the results of these changes in a couple of places when the Width or Selection tools are active and the path is fully selected:

To the right of the Stroke weight field in the Control bar

At the bottom of the Stroke panel (Select Show Options from the panel menu if necessary) where it’s labeled Profile

from the panel menu if necessary) where it’s labeled In the Properties panel where it’s labeled Stroke Profile.

Alongside the profile in each of these locations is a drop-down menu; Click it to reveal pre-loaded profiles and a Save button at the bottom:

Click the Save button and name your profile. If you’ve placed and modified many width points the profile thumbnail will appear as an undulating shape. Stroke profiles are saved by the application and become available in all your other Illustrator files.

Here are my final width edits to the word I drew earlier underlined with an arc that has the saved profile applied:

As you can see the Width tool is perfect for varying the weight of strokes and quickly giving plain lines and curves character and contrast.

Céline Dion is taking a break from the road as she recovers from a health issue.

The five-time Grammy Award winner 53 canceled the remainder of the North American leg of her Courage World Tour which was scheduled for March 9 to April 22 noting that she's being treated for ""severe and persistent muscle spasms"" in a statement shared Saturday on her website.

""I was really hoping that I'd be good to go by now but I suppose I just have to be more patient and follow the regimen that my doctors are prescribing"" she wrote. ""There's a lot of organizing and preparation that goes into our shows and so we have to make decisions today which will affect the plans two months down the road.""

""I'll be so glad to get back to full health as well as all of us getting past this pandemic and I can't wait to be back on stage again. Meanwhile I've been very touched by all the words of encouragement that everyone's been sending to me on social media. I feel your love and support and it means the world to me"" Dion added.

She previously performed 52 shows across North America for the tour which was halted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The tour will resume in May with the European and Middle Eastern leg.

Dion previously postponed her new Las Vegas residency which was originally set to open at The Theatre at Resorts World in November. She also cited her muscle spasms which prevent her from performing and remains under treatment by her medical team.

That’s right we’re talking about American Horror Story star Sarah Paulson’s online love letter to her long-time lover and legendary actress Holland Taylor.

On Jan 14 Paulson posted a heartwarming birthday tribute to longtime partner Taylor with a warm-lighted photo of the actress smiling at the camera. Paulson posted the photo with the caption “Love of My Life. The one. The only one. January 14th is my favorite day of the year- a day to unabashedly celebrate you @hollandvtaylor. I am the luckiest of the lucky. I love you only. Happy Birthday magical poet darling.”

Paulson and Taylor have been together since 2015 after working together on a reproductive rights campaign but the pair met a decade prior as Paulson told the New York Times. They’ve been happily together since despite many criticizing the 32 year age difference between the two.

Paulson told Entertainment Weekly per The List in response to the criticism “I am the captain of my own ship and I’ve never looked to anyone else to validate that or tell me it’s OK.”

In another interview with Town & Country back in 2018 Paulson said “I do not want to be defined by who I share my bed my home my soul with. My choices in life have been unconventional and that’s my business.”

Happy belated birthday Holland Taylor!

That or he showed he should have been a first-teamer along with Jordan Poyer because Hyde laid out for a ridiculous interception of New England quarterback Mac Jones.

Going for the end zone Jones floated a pass up that did not appear like he put the ball in harm’s way. Instead Hyde flew across the field and lunged to get his hands on the ball.

Hyde fell to the cold turf and hung onto the ball for the pick off.

The HBO drama's second season opens with a Fez-centric episode in which viewers learn more about the character's backstory but Cloud has told GQ that the long-awaited episode may not have happened at all if the show had stuck to its original plan.

""I was super juiced up. Reading that script I was fired up for sure"" he said of the Fez-focused season premiere – before dropping the news that it nearly never came to light because ""I was supposed to die in season 1"".

Elaborating on the shock news he said: ""Apparently because they cast me off the street I guess the character of Fezco was [never meant to stick around]. I don't even know how [he was meant to die]. I never saw that script. No one ever told me.

""It was one day when we were filming the pilot that I think Jacob [Elordi who plays Nate Jacobs] told me he was like 'Oh yeah you didn't know? Your character gets [imitates being shot]. And yeah it never ended up happening.

""I think that they liked what I did and so they decided to keep me alive and let me rock. I don't know how I was going out but hopefully I would've gone out like a G.""

Cloud also promised that fans can expect to see a softer side to Fez in the new season explaining that seeing his background will make his actions seem far more understandable.

""He's still a kid like everyone else. He might be a year older but he had to act like an adult from such a young age. But his inner kid is still in there and you get to see it come out slightly.""

The star added that getting to play a slightly less tough side of Fez has been a welcome relief for him saying that he has welcomed a slight reduction in ""intensity"".

""It's nice because I'm not the most serious guy in real life but on the show I'm usually not smiling"" he said. ""So it was nice to be able to just stop furrowing my brow. At the end of a long day of carrying the angry serious face it's nice to relax on that intensity.""

Euphoria airs Sundays on HBO and HBO Max and is available the next day on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW in the UK.

For more information please read our disclosure policy here

While Ben Affleck has had a pretty stellar acting career he’s also been through the ringer — divorce bad movies (I mean did you see Gigli?) public substance abuse the tabloid fodder that is his relationship with J.Lo …

But perhaps there is nothing more annoying and cringe-worthy than having the same phonetic name as the insurance company that is Aflac.

“This is my cross to bear” Affleck joked to Lily Rabe one of his The Tender Bar costars during a January 12th segment of Wired’s “Autocomplete Interview.”

Apparently this similarity in names between “Affleck” and “Aflac” is brought up all the time. I can imagine that it would be hella annoying to deal with on the daily.

During the segment of Wired’s “Autocomplete Interview” Ben Affleck and Lily Rabe jest back and forth about the unfortunate reality of having basically the same last as an insurance giant.

Have you ever seen “Autocomplete Interview?” It is an internet video series that asks celebrities some of the most Googled questions about themselves and these celebrities then give (hopefully) the actual factual answers.

Does Ben Affleck own Aflac Insurance?

This is one of the many most asked questions that people Google about Ben Affleck. Random? Not as much as you’d think.

Imagine this — An insurance company imagine you have a very unusual kind of slightly unappealing sounding name. Now imagine that somehow there’s a huge insurance company that also has that name. Ben Affleck

Wired

Now imagine that insurance company has a bottomless budget to buy television commercials. And now imagine that their creative choice is to hire a duck to shriek your last name in as loud and obnoxious a way as humanly possible for the duration of a television commercial. Ben Affleck

Wired

And then imagine what it’s like when you’re on an airplane and the hammered lady behind you recognizes you and thinks she’s gonna do her best Gilbert Gottfried for six hours all the way to New York. Ben Affleck

Wired

I don’t even WANT to imagine that. LOL!! Gilbert Gottfried is not only known for being a rude and crude comedian his voice is almost more famous than he is. I’m sure he is a fine upstanding individual but his voice sends cold shivers up my spine — like nails on a chalkboard. I mean have you heard him?!? Here — listen to this. (Don’t watch it with kids in the room. He is pretty crude.)

Thank you Aflac! I don’t own it! But I deserve it. I would like a discount. Ben Affleck

Wired

Come on Aflac. He’s got a point. He’s like a walking billboard for the company.

Hook a guy up with the free insurance — like he needs it. LOL!!

Has Ben Affleck Recently Been In Any Movies?

It’s been a hot minute since we’ve really seen Ben in anything. He has mostly been working in the role of executive producer for a bunch of films.

But good news for all those Affleck fans out there. He is currently in a new film that was released in December. It actually looks really really good.

It is based on the best selling memoir The Tender Bar which was named a “Best Book of the Year” by The New York Times.

Amazon

​​From director George Clooney and based on the best-selling memoir The Tender Bar follows an aspiring writer (Tye Sheridan) pursuing his romantic and professional dreams. From a stool in his uncle’s (Ben Affleck) bar he learns what it means to grow up from a colorful group of local characters. Amazon

You can stream The Tender Bar right from Amazon Prime for free if you have a Prime membership.

Changing where and how they buy their clothes cutting down on meat and dairy and replacing trips in the car with journeys by foot. I’ve done all of those – but I’ve taken it further.

Six months ago I had my blood tested for 100 different persistent organic pollutants or POPs – chemicals such as pesticides and flame retardants that accumulate inside us and stick around for longer than we’d like. Scientists at a specialist lab in Norway found traces of chemicals that were taken off the market decades ago such as low levels of a metabolite of the infamous pesticide DDT alongside concerning levels of some of the less well-known “forever chemicals” known as PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances – a class of chemicals that includes the likes of Teflon). Most surprisingly my blood contained relatively high levels of a chemical called oxychlordane that comes from a pesticide known as chlordane that was banned by the EU in 1981 just a year after I was born so exposure was probably via the womb. What struck me most is that some of these highly hazardous chemicals last more than a lifetime.

And so began my mission to find out how we can better protect ourselves – and the next generation – from these legacy pollutants.

Perhaps because toxic chemical pollution isn’t that obvious it is often overlooked. So while public awareness of single-use plastic waste has soared in recent years – all of those bottles straws and carrier bags are tangible symptoms of our disposable mindset and overconsumption – there’s much more to the story.

So in a bid to reduce my chemical footprint and that of my family I’ve scrubbed up on the science and distilled the latest research into practical and simple tips. Ultimately it’s time that we joined the dots and made this invisible world much more visible.

Avoid the greenwash

View image in fullscreen Check cleaning products to see how sustainable they really are. Photograph: the_burtons/Getty Images

Don’t be duped by clever marketing campaigns that aim to convince us we need the latest eco thingamajig. No product might be better than a less toxic one. If a label makes sustainability claims look for proof – download a shopping app such as Giki which allows you to scan supermarket products to see how sustainable they are.

Beware of unregulated language such as “natural” “eco-friendly” “nature-inspired” and be suspicious of products that say they are “chemical free” (there is no such thing – everything is a chemical and not all chemicals are bad) or “free from”. Look for brands that are fully transparent about their supply chains and the ingredients they do use rather than distracting with mentions of things they don’t include.

Ditch the disinfectant

Think before you flush anything down the toilet or the plughole – most bottles of cleaning products that contain chlorine bleach have a picture of a dead fish on the back and for good reason. They poison aquatic wildlife but also act as irritants to us. Overuse of bleach leads to antimicrobial resistance and in most cases gentle cleaning products such as bicarbonate of soda or vinegar mixed with lemon juice plus a little elbow grease do the job just fine. Our homes aren’t sterile places – save disinfectants for medical settings and look out for an emerging trend for probiotic cleaning products that fight germs by encouraging healthy bacteria.

Bust the dust

Advice to do more dusting may not be a tip you’re keen to follow but actually it’s about more targeted dusting. Adults unwittingly ingest about 20mg of dust every day. Children and pets even more so. But many toxic chemicals released from products in our home accumulate in dust from fragrances to PFASs so it’s important to wipe it away regularly with a damp cloth – no polish required.

Rather than concentrating your efforts on windowsills and shelves make sure to clean electronics such as the wifi router DVD player and game consoles as flame retardants can transfer into dust settling on these items.

Forget the fragrance

Our homes shouldn’t smell of overpowering scents such as pine cones or sea spray. Air fresheners are a concentrated source of indoor air contaminants that can exacerbate conditions such as asthma. Residues of fragranced detergents stay on clothes and linen too. While not all synthetic fragrances are harmful their many ingredients are not usually listed in full and we might not be told enough about what’s in them.

P is for persistent

From school trousers lined with strengthening Teflon knee patches to non-stick cookware food packaging and smudgeproof mascara PFAS chemicals are added to so many everyday products. These super stable chemicals last for ever in our bodies and in the environment. Many of them are endocrine-disrupting – which means they disrupt our hormone system – and some may be carcinogens.

Things that claim they are waterproof stain-resistant wrinkle-free or grease-repellent probably contain PFASs. If you are unsure there is a clever test you can do called the bead test. For this you drop a tiny amount of olive oil on to a surface. If the oil repels into a bead shape it is highly likely to contain PFAS chemicals.

Then you can decide: do the alleged benefits of the product outweigh the potentially toxic cost? If you’re not happy make a conscious effort to seek out PFAS-free alternatives.

Toxic by design

Pesticide residues remain on our fruit and veg inside loaves of bread on non-organic cotton bedding and even non-organic tampons. These agricultural chemicals sprayed on crops to kill insects weeds and fungi are in every room of the home. Try streamlining your exposure by switching to organic for the foods you eat most of. There is a really helpful guide to how UK supermarkets are doing on this by the Pesticide Action Network (PAN). It ranks British supermarkets according to pesticide use. Perhaps underlining the adage you get what you pay for M&S and Waitrose come out top but even these two have a way to go.

Breathe easy

The accumulation of indoor air pollutants and volatile organic compounds or VOCs (things such as formaldehyde and benzene) can be avoided by simply opening a window. Ventilate well if you are lighting an open fire (electric heating from renewable sources is cleaner all round) and use an extractor while cooking if you have one. The back hob rings are preferable if you have a cooker hood to capture more pollutants. At night body heat increases the temperature in our beds so more VOCs can “off-gas” or be released from conventional polyurethane mattresses so ventilate your bedroom or better still invest in a mattress topper made from natural materials.

Buy secondhand

That off-gassing of VOCs happens from a lot of furniture and medium-density fibreboard (MDF) more so when new so search out vintage bargains especially if you’re decorating a room for children. If you do buy new unwrap it and let it air for a few days before you install. If you’re putting up shelves or other fixtures use screws rather than glues and adhesives. And if you’re upcycling use low-VOC paints and varnishes. Buy secondhand clothes and textiles – they will contain drastically reduced pesticide residues if any and you’ll be saving the need to make more new items.

Detox your diet

A high toxic load puts more strain on our body’s own natural detox mechanisms mainly the liver and kidneys just as smoking or drinking do. So eat plenty of antioxidants which help to neutralise the free radicals that are produced after exposure to toxins and can damage DNA and lead to degenerative diseases. So plenty of leafy green veg nuts and berries – organic if possible!

This recall was made after the authority conducted a series of tests as part of an EU project called Coordinated Activities on the Safety of Products (CASP). Through this project member states cooperate together with the European Commission’s DG Justice and Consumers to select products and organise testing activities resulting in greater cohesion across the European market.

The toys recalled did not comply with the requirements of the Toy Safety Directive and applicable European standards. The hazards these toys presented to young children included small parts that could be swallowed and block the child’s flow of air; prohibited chemicals; and/or packaging presenting a risk of strangulation or asphyxiation.

Four of the recalled toys were found in local shops. These were:

• 4 Channels R/C Aerobus (Code: HURC1101);

• 1213 Toys Baby Doll (Bar code: 1287770174561);

• Remote Control Honeybee Vehicle (Bar code: 999800352; Item no.: 34681); and

• Wheel King New 4X4 No. 755-3B (Bar code: 5356101803923).

All the abovementioned toys were recalled due to the presence of prohibited chemicals for consumer products. The chemicals phthalates for example may harm children’s health causing possible damage to their reproductive system. The other recalled toys were available for sale to Maltese consumers through online retailers from third countries. A complete list of the recalled toys may be found on the MCCAA website at www.mccaa.org.mt/news.

Consumers who bought these unsafe toys are being advised to refrain from using them and where possible return them to the retailer from where they bought them. In such situations consumer legislation obliges sellers to provide appropriate redress to consumers.

Consumers are advised to refrain from using them and where possible return them to the retailer - Odette Vella

The remedy can take the form of repair where possible or replacement of the recalled product with a safe one.

Should the seller refuse to provide one of these remedies affected consumers may contact the Office for Consumer Affairs at the MCCAA if the seller is locally based or ECC Malta if the seller operates from another EU member state.

When buying certain products online including toys consumers are urged to be cautious as these types of products have specific safety requirements and must comply with the applicable European legislation. Extra precautions must be taken when consumers opt to buy from a seller who operates from outside the EU.

In the first instance it is imperative that consumers know who they are buying from. They must look for the seller’s full contact information. When buying a toy it is a legal requirement for the product to bear the name and address of the manufacturer and importer and a type batch serial or model number or other element to allow for its identification.

This information may also be provided on the packaging or in a document accompanying the toy where the size or nature of the product does not allow it.

Consumers are also advised to verify the seller’s reliability. A simple way of doing this is to check online consumer-rating reviews as these can give an indication of problems encountered by other consumers. For authentic reviews one should always seek independent and unbiased reviews.

Prior to buying a toy consumers should also read any safety instructions age restrictions or other warnings available online to help them decide whether the product is suitable for the children they intend to give it to.

If consumers feel unsure about safety-related aspects they may do some online research about the product or communicate with the seller for more information.

Consumers are also advised to check whether the product they intend to buy has been recalled by visiting online recall databases for unsafe products such as Safety Gate. This database contains a list of recalled products from across the European member states.

If despite all the precautions taken consumers still face a problem linked to product safety they should first report the problem to the seller or online platform. Then they should notify the MCCAA. Consumers are also encouraged to write a review on the product and sellers to alert future potential consumers. For any queries or further information on product safety e-mail the MCCAA at marketsurveillance@mccaa.org.mt.",,,,,,

The description on IMDB reads:

""With an eye for every budget three travelers visit vacation rentals around the globe and share their expert tips and tricks in this reality series.""

After the success of the first season Netflix released a second season of the show just a few months later on September 14th. The very first episode of season two titled ""Super Modern Stays"" features a rental property right here in the Midwest! The home was designed by none other than American architect Frank Lloyd Wright.

If you're not familiar with Frank Lloyd Wright Wikipedia says the he ""designed more than 1000 structures over a creative period of 70 years."" Born in 1867 Frank was raised in Wisconsin and went on to become one of the most influential architects in history. It's very fitting that this particular home ended up being built in Wisconsin.

Located in Two Rivers Frank Lloyd Wright's Schwartz House was designed in 1938 for a Life Magazine feature. Eight of the best architects across the globe were asked to design a house that would be considered a ""dream home"" for the typical middle-class American family. In 1940 Bernard Schwartz and his wife decided to bring the 3000 sq. ft. home to life in Frank's home state.

The property has four bedrooms four bathrooms and is unlike any home you've ever seen. The ceiling heights differ throughout the space the floors are heated and concrete and the window designs create an abundance of natural light. Plus a lot of the original furniture and décor is still inside in the home making it feel extra authentic. It's even listed on the National Register of Historic Places! Oh and did we mention that it's located on an acre of land that backs up to the East Twin River? It's GORGEOUS!

The Still Bend/Frank Lloyd Wright's Schwartz House is currently available to rent on Airbnb for $539 per night but it does seem to book up pretty quickly. Out of 225 reviews it has 4.91 out of 5 stars. You can read more about the property and book your stay HERE.

'We just went into our Airbnb and it is a complete disaster. It is nine o'clock at night' the Pretty Little Liars star said in a video clip.

'I'm scared I don't like it. It's haunted' the star's daughter Phoenix complained as Tammin tried to soothe her by saying 'You don't have to be scared. It's not haunted'.

Tammin went on to tell her fans that this had 'never happened' to her before and in the past Airbnb had been 'amazing'.

'What a s**tshow' she said from her bed the next morning. 'Airbnb refunded everything which they should have. Thank goodness.'

'I've never had that experience I've never had to be refunded for a place I have stayed because normally everything is great. But it was a disaster. When you walked in it's stunk like black mold. So that ended' she added.

Eventually Tammin found a new property to stay at complete with a bathtub for her kids after some further issues with an unfriendly renter.

Susan Wheeldon Airbnb's Country Manager for Australia told Daily Mail Australia in a statement: 'The Airbnb community is built on trust and our team continues to work diligently to help ensure each stay is a positive experience.

'In addition to adhering to our Community Standards Hosts must meet standards that include listing cleanliness and accuracy. We require that all listing categorisations features and amenities detailed on the listing page at the time of booking accurately reflect those present at the listing from check-in to checkout.

'Our authentic review system also helps create trust by allowing people to see what other community members have said about a potential guest Host or home.'

Tammin who was for years based in Los Angeles is currently in Australia for work and chose to drive from Queensland to her new gig on the soap opera Neighbours rather than fly due to the rising Covid case numbers.

She and her film producer husband Sean McEwen 45 have two daughters Phoenix eight and Lennon two."

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

Microsoft Azure is an integrated collection of cloud platforms for building managing and supporting applications and services.

Solutions available cover hosting backup cloud computing application development e-commerce monitoring data analysis and more.

Microsoft Azure also includes a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Perhaps surprisingly this isn't solely based around Microsoft's own edge servers but also offers three plans using other CDN networks: Standard Akamai Standard Verizon and Premium Verizon.

Want to try Microsoft Azure? Check out the website here

One major benefit of using Azure is its integration with Microsoft technologies. You can quickly deploy it alongside other Azure storage web apps or media services for instance. The CDN can be managed from PowerShell or .NET a big plus for many developers and sysadmins as well as via a REST API and Node.js.

Azure's Standard plan covers the basics: custom domain name support (cdn.mydomain.com) HTTPS support HTTP/2 geo-filtering (block access by country) load balancing and DDoS protection.

One not-so-common Standard Verizon addition is ""asset pre-loading"" which enables specifying objects to be cached before they're requested. The first request from each region then gets the file immediately without having to wait as it's fetched from the origin.

The full-fat 'Premium Verizon' plan extends the CDN with real-time stats and alerts advanced HTTP reports token authentication (hotlink protection) and a more powerful rules engine to change cache or header settings redirect URLs and generally play around with content delivery. Although other CDNs typically offer some of this functionality as standard Microsoft's implementation is impressive.

Getting a full picture of the CDN's capabilities proved more difficult than we expected as even some basic information isn't clearly presented on the site. Curious about the number of PoPs available with each network for instance? That's not disclosed for the Akamai plan Microsoft's own figures are only mentioned on the Locations page (118 PoPs across 100 cities) and the company recommends you ignore these anyway and try each of the plans to see which works best.

If you're interested in Azure then we'd recommend you start with the official CDN Comparison page look at the various features and follow the links to get detailed explanations. Check out the CDN Documentation page too. Search for features like purge or whatever else is a priority and make sure the plans deliver what you'd expect.

Pricing

Microsoft Azure CDN uses a pay-as-you-go scheme where you're charged for the level of bandwidth you use. As with Amazon CloudFront and many other CDNs data transfer prices vary depending on region they're using.

The Standard Akamai and Standard Verizon plans are priced similarly to Amazon CloudFront with charges starting at $0.081 per GB for North America Europe the Middle East and Africa ranging up to $0.233 for South America. Rates drop after the first 10TB depending on the amount you use so for example if you're in North America and use 150TB a month the last 100TB costs $0.056 per GB.

The Premium Verizon plan costs roughly twice as much for the first 10TB of traffic ($0.158 to $0.466 per GB) and again there are discounts if you use more.

Overall costs of even the Standard plans can be twice that of competitors like KeyCDN let alone budget services like Bunny (priced from $0.005/ GB.) They're cheaper than many high-end enterprise CDNs though and the integration with Microsoft technologies may make this a price worth paying for some.

If you'd like to get a feel for your costs the Azure site has a Pricing Calculator to help you figure out your monthly bill. Choose a plan enter a traffic estimate for each region and the total is displayed immediately. Keep in mind that tech support is priced from a $29 a month for trial use or $100 for 'for small or medium-sized companies with minimal business-critical dependence on Azure.' But if that's too much for you don't necessarily let it put you off as there's a vast and hugely detailed web knowledgebase available for free.

Alternatively sign up for Azure and you'll get $200 free credit for 30 days use. This could give you more than 1500GB of traffic enough to trial even the largest of sites and it doesn't automatically renew as a paid product so there's no risk.

Setup

The Azure web dashboard is complex crammed with features and functionality and the most expert user might initially struggle to find their way around. For example a left-hand sidebar covers 23 different areas (Function Apps SQL Databases Load Balancers Virtual Machines) each of which leads to its own management panel with yet more options.

(Image credit: Microsoft)

Typing ‘CDN’ in the Search box led us to the right area but even there terminology like ‘CDN profile’ and ‘resource group’ may seem unfamiliar. Our first attempt to create a CDN profile generated the error 'please ensure that Microsoft.CDN is listed as a registered Resource Provider in your Azure subscription' with no link to explain the issue further. Searching for the answer first got us a page recommending we run some PowerShell but then directed us to a portal solution which turned out to be quick and easy.

Play around for a while though and the system starts to make more sense. Create a CDN profile and you can add multiple zones. You're able to define their type (Storage Cloud Service Web App more) and URL. Each can have a sensibly-named CDN domain too like mytestdomain.azureedge.net.

An optional Dynamic Site Optimization feature accelerates performance with route and TCP optimizations and object prefetch and mobile image compression with Akamai. This isn't cheap with prices starting at $0.19 but the $200 of free credit means you can at least try before you buy.

Once you're set up Azure works much like any other CDN. Edit your code to use the ""mytestdomain.azureedge.net"" CDN URL (or add a CNAME record to use a custom domain name) with assets you'd like to cache and the system will load them on the first request and start serving them to visitors.

Access an Endpoint and you're finally able to explore Azure's CDN settings. These turn out to be flexible too far more so than much of the competition. You don't just click a button to turn compression on and off for instance – you're able to define exactly which MIME types you'd like optimized.

It's easy to decide how the service treats URLs with query strings too (page.ashx?q=this). In a click or two you can choose to bypass caching for queries (the asset is grabbed from the origin each time) cache the first request and always serve that asset or treat every request as a unique URL (page.ashx?q=this and page.ashx?q=that would be cached as separate assets each with their own time to live).

Geo-filtering is well-handled with no need to learn coding techniques or create scripts. Instead you're able to specify individual files or folders then allow or block them from your choice of countries.

When you've collected enough data Azure also provides assorted reports and analytics to help you understand what's going.

Other tools are more cryptic and the interface doesn't always offer much upfront help in figuring out how they work. You'll also run into Azure's management features hugely powerful in themselves. Need to share control of the CDN with others in your business for instance? There's a vast Access Control system where you're able to create users groups and roles and define exactly who can do what.

If you think this sounds complicated then you're right. There is a vast amount of documentation available (this sample tutorial is a good example) and eventually you'll master the basics but beware: it might take a while.

Performance

Will Azure CDN deliver the speed you need? There's really no way to say for sure as there are so many variables to consider – the locations of your visitors the Azure plan you're using the size and types of files the web applications and whether you're using extras like Azure's Dynamic Site Optimization.

CDNPerf offers a starting point by comparing CDN response times experienced by real users across the globe. It's a single figure and can't offer any definitive verdict but still provides a basic view of how the edge servers compare.

As we write CDNPerf.com currently ranks Azure CDN a disappointing 16th out of 21 contenders with an average worldwide response time of 38.29ms.

There's a tiny consolation for Microsoft in that it still beat some big names including CDN.NET (42.49ms) Cloudflare CDN (51.34ms) and OVH CDN (59.93ms.)

But the reality is Azure CDN trailed a very long way behind the likes of 5centsCDN (24.15ms) Google Cloud CDN (24.51ms) and AWS CloudFront CDN (25.51ms.)

These figures are worldwide averages and sometimes a CDN performs much better (or worse) in particular countries or continents.

Azure CDN though was unspectacular just about everywhere with a best speed placing of 11th in Asia and a worst of 18th in Europe.

That's not exactly encouraging but as we mentioned above these results won't necessarily reflect what you'll see. If Azure's feature set is a perfect fit for your project then it could still be a smart choice.

Final verdict

Azure CDN is a must-see if you'll use other Azure services or might appreciate the .NET or PowerShell management features but its complexity and cost mean that less demanding users might be better off elsewhere.

Here's why you should get AppleCare+ as well,"In October 2019 Apple announced its newest wireless earbuds the AirPods Pro. The $250 wireless earbuds are the most expensive we've seen from Apple and also the most capable. The Pro version of the extremely popular AirPods includes active noise cancellation a new transparency mode improved sound and a new design. However if you're going to pay $250 for some wireless earbuds you should also consider paying $29 for two years of AppleCare+ coverage.

Apple published a support page that shows how much it will cost to replace an AirPods Pro or the charging case should you lose it or your dog decides it looks like a chew toy.

Screenshot by Taylor Clemons/ZDNet

Without AppleCare+ replacing an AirPods Pro will set you back $89 per earbud. If you need to replace the charging case that'll cost you $89 as well.

The price for AppleCare+ is $29 and with that you get an extended warranty as well as coverage for accidental damage. With AppleCare+ a damaged AirPods Pro or charging case will cost $29 to replace. That's a fairly significant savings even if you have to replace an earbud on two different occasions. You're given two ""incidents"" with the AppleCare+ fee meaning you can replace two earbuds or the charging case twice or any combination and still play the lowered replacement fees.

Unfortunately AppleCare+ doesn't cover lost or stolen AirPods Pro so you'll have to pay the $89 replacement fee if you lose an earbud. A lost charging case will cost you $99.

Now he's one of Captain Hook's pirates in the Disney on Ice show coming Thursday to Allstate Arena. Courtesy of Disney on Ice

The story of how 34-year-old Michael DiNello of Schaumburg ends up as one of Captain Hook's pirate henchman in pursuit of Tinkerbell starts on a summer day in 2015. The sun was beating down and the temperature was pushing 100 when DiNello got his life-altering phone call.

""I was on the roof repairing a fan motor on a commercial air conditioner"" remembers DiNello who after graduating from Schaumburg High School in 2006 studied at Environmental Technical Institute to become a heating ventilation air conditioning and refrigeration technician.

A buddy he met as a teen doing BMX tricks on his bike at Scrap Skate Park in Hoffman Estates was part of a BMX team performing with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey's Circus Xtreme. He asked if DiNello wanted to join the circus.

""You know what? I would be interested in that"" said DiNello. ""That sounds like a wonderful opportunity.""

He fixed the AC unit flew to Anaheim California nailed his audition gave two weeks' notice at his HVAC job and began his circus career as a BMX stunt performer in September 2015.

He got to work alongside elephants clowns and the person who gets shot out of a cannon. When that show was retired in May 2017 DiNello moved to Orange County California. ""I figured air conditioning would be popular out there so I brought my tools with me"" he says. ""That was paying the rent.""

Having honed his jumping abilities as a Schaumburg teen riding his BMX bike over obstacles Michael DiNello left learned how to do the same on figure skates to land a job with the Disney on Ice show coming Thursday to Allstate Arena. Courtesy of Disney on Ice

Kenny Short a hockey player from Minnesota who met DiNello when they were both working at the circus was working for Disney on Ice and wondered if they could do their BMX performance on an ice rink. ""We workshopped to see if we could add it to the show and - spoiler alert - it turned out working pretty well"" DiNello says.

He rode his bike through the ice ramps as part of Disney of Ice's ""Road Trip Adventures"" show. Having bought a pair of inline skates in California and gotten pretty good DiNello bought a pair of ice skates in 2019 and quickly learned how to handle himself on the ice. ""I started skating almost every day"" he says.

So even though bikes aren't a part of ""Mickey's Search Party"" coming to Rosemont's Allstate Arena Thursday through Sunday DiNello now is part of the skating cast. While professional figure skaters are known to perform a ""flying camel"" spin DiNello appears in a camel costume on skates for a scene from ""Aladdin.""

""I was able to push inside the camel"" says DiNello who doesn't mind not being the center of attention. ""Anonymity is not always a bad thing.""

He skates as a caretaker to Ham the pig in a ""Toy Story"" number jumps off a ramp as an ice harvester during a scene from ""Frozen"" and plays an evil character in the ""Peter Pan"" performance.

""I am one of Captain Hook's pirates. We'll stop at nothing to capture Tinker Bell and get this magic to Captain Hook"" DiNello says. ""Well it starts off well but Mickey and his pals always have different plans. It's not for lack of effort that's for sure.""

Having taught himself how to ice skate in 2019 Schaumburg native Michael DiNello is a cast member with Disney on Ice who spins his girlfriend and aerial performer Kimberly Dodson during ""Mickey's Search Party."" Courtesy of Disney on Ice

In another scene DiNello appears with his girlfriend Kimberly Dodson a figure skater who stars as Rapunzel and also performs aerial moves. ""I spin her while she's on the top flying"" DiNello says of the ""Spanish Web"" maneuver. The pair both vegan travel together and cook many of their own plant-based meals. ""One of my suitcases is my cookware"" says DiNello who appreciates the environmental benefits of avoiding animal products but says he also has felt healthier since he became vegan three years ago.

DiNello envisions skating with Disney on Ice for another couple of decades.

Growing up with his sister Gina Nuzzo and parents Domenic and Christine DiNello says he had a great childhood riding BMX courses.

""We'd find some random wreckage in the parking lot and see if we could jump over it"" he says. He'd ride his bike to the Hoffman Estates park do tricks all day and then ride his bike home. He says coach Jimmy Walker taught him the technical aspects of BMX riding. But he greatly appreciates his adult life. ""For the most part it's a lot nicer falling on ice than cement"" he says.

Working as a professional ice skater continues to push him.

""These people are absolute professionals"" DiNello says of his fellow cast members. ""There's a lot of people who set that bar high for the rest of us.""

He's come a long way from fixing rooftop air conditioners.

""Every day I think about that. If you can dream it there's nothing that can stop you"" DiNello says. ""I'm a living example of that.""

From Hankton’s bio on official UGA site:

Former NFL wide receiver Cortez Hankton was named Pass Game Coordinator and Wide Receivers Coach in February of 2019 after serving the 2018 season as an assistant coach in charge of the receivers.

During his tenure at UGA Hankton has been part of teams that became the first in school history to win 11 or more games three straight seasons (2017-19) won two SEC Eastern Division titles (2018-19) and earned three consecutive appearances in a New Year’s Six Bowl game (2019 Allstate Sugar 2020 Allstate Sugar 2021 Chick-fil-A Peach). The Bulldogs also finished in the top 10 in the final CFP rankings four straight years (2017-2020). The 2019 and 2020 senior classes won 44 games—tied for most in school history.

At UGA Hankton has coached SEC All-Freshman wide receiver George Pickens the MVP of the 2020 Allstate Sugar Bowl victory over Baylor. Additionally he coached several big-play receivers in 2018 in senior Terry Godwin and juniors Mecole Hardman and Riley Ridley who combined for 1475 receiving yards. All three were drafted in the 2019 NFL draft: Hardman 2nd round Kansas City; Ridley 4th round Chicago; and Godwin 7th round Carolina.

Hankton joined the Georgia staff in February 2018 after coaching wide receivers for three seasons at Vanderbilt where he coached veteran receivers C.J. Duncan and Trent Sherfield along with Caleb Scott and Kalija Lipscomb. Sherfield ended his career among the program’s best in receptions (136) and 1869 yards.

Prior to his tenure at Vanderbilt Hankton coached receivers for three seasons at Dartmouth in the Ivy League (2012-14). During that time he helped the Big Green to a 20-10 overall record including an 8-2 mark in 2014.

Hankton’s produced an All-Ivy caliber receiver all three years at Dartmouth. In 2012 senior Michael Reilly earned first-team recognition with Ryan McManus receiving honorable mention.

Hankton was signed as an undrafted rookie free agent in April 2003 by Jacksonville. In his four years with the Jaguars he caught 34 passes for 310 yards and a pair of touchdowns both of which came in 2004. Hankton signed with Minnesota in 2007 and spent the entire 2008 season on injured reserve with Tampa Bay.

After his NFL career he played three seasons with New York Florida and Virginia of the United Football League.

Prior to joining the Dartmouth staff in 2012 Hankton spent three months working as a volunteer assistant with Central Florida. In that role he assisted in all aspects of the recruiting process. From 2008-10 Hankton spent time training draft-eligible athletes for the NFL combines with Tom Shaw Performance Training Camps. In early 2010 he also served as non-paid receiver coach at Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando.

Hankton received his bachelor’s degree in business administration from Texas Southern in 2002 where he set season and career records for receiving yards. A four-year starter and two-year captain he was Texas Southern’s MVP and an All-SWAC honoree as a junior and senior. Hankton culminated his career by being named as a Division I-AA third-team All-America by AP.

Hankton in 2011 created Black Ice Concept an organization that strives to increase minority presence in winter sports by obtaining sponsorships and funding to subsidize expenses for the athletes. He has demonstrated his commitment to academics many times over as well including the creation of the Cortez Hankton Scholarship Fund for exemplary student-athletes in 2003 and his work with Read Across America through the NFL and the National Education Association. From 2016-17 Hankton volunteered with “Walk for Wishes” a fund raising program for Make-A-Wish Middle Tennessee.

Since September of 2020 Hankton has mentored Bulldog football players in their “Dawgs for Pups” campaign to assist Athens-area children with a number of vital goods and services. Thus far the program has provided Internet access for in-home learning coats during the winter season and a “Food2Kids” snack drive.

A native of New Orleans Hankton is the son of Cortez Sr. and Sherome Hankton both officers in the New Orleans Police Department. Hankton was a standout athlete and multi-year starter at St. Augustine High School.

Bitcoin BTC/USD Bull and SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci says that his firm is investing heavily in Algorand ALGO/USD because he thinks the cryptocurrency will replace many of its competing blockchains.

In a recent interview he said that ALGO will challenge leading competitors in the crypto industry just like Alphabet Inc GOOGL did in the early days of the internet.

“I’ve got a quarter-billion dollars in Algorand right now. I think Algorand will be the Google” Scaramucci said.

In December 2021 he compared Algorand's potential to pass Ethereum ETH/USD in market cap to the opportunity that Google capitalized on bypassing its predecessors in the early stages of the internet.

Algorand is a blockchain-based crypto platform that focuses on security scalability and decentralization.

It is faster than Ethereum and offers lower transaction fees. ALGO also has a net-negative carbon footprint.

“I think ultimately when the big enterprises get on to the tokenization side of the market and they start working in the world of DeFi they’ll need something that’s scalable like Algorand secure like Algorand and ultimately decentralized so they won’t have to worry about capricious inflation-deflation of what it is that they’re using as a form of exchange of value” Scaramucci added.

He feels that Algorand is the future and it’s going to require more and more people doing deep-dive due diligence and making the decision to choose the blockchain.

During an interview in December of last year Scaramucci told CNBC his funds hold about $9 billion in assets with $1.3 billion of that consisting of crypto investments. Each fund has a 10% to 25% allocation to crypto.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc will require retail and corporate employees to provide proof of a COVID-19 booster shot The Verge reported https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/15/22885181/apple-vaccine-covid-19-booster-shot-employees on Saturday citing an internal email.

Starting Jan. 24 unvaccinated employees or those who haven't submitted proof of vaccination will need negative COVID-19 tests to enter Apple workplaces the report said. The Verge said it was not immediately clear if the testing requirement applies to both corporate and retail employees.

""Due to waning efficacy of the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines and the emergence of highly transmissible variants such as Omicron a booster shot is now part of staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccination to protect against severe disease"" the memo read according to The Verge.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Many companies in the U.S. have been strengthening their COVID-19 rules mandating vaccination and delaying back-to-office plans as the Omicron variant increases infections across the country.

This week Facebook parent Meta Platforms mandated COVID-19 booster shots for all workers returning to offices. It also delayed U.S. office reopenings to March 28 from an earlier plan of Jan. 31.

Alphabet Inc's Google on Friday said it was temporarily mandating weekly COVID-19 tests for people entering its U.S. offices.

A report by The Information said Amazon.com Inc has offered its U.S. warehouse workers $40 to get a booster shot.

While the success of a unicorn startup could include various factors from the idea to timing the education of its founders can play a huge role too.

Professor Ilya Strebulaev from Stanford Graduate School of Business has made extensive research on 1263 founders from 521 unicorn startups on what level of academic qualifications they hold.

Research shows that 236 founders have an MBA including DoorDash CEO Tony Xu. A total of 217 founders have master’s other than MBAs. Alphabet Inc’s Larry Page for instance has a Master’s in Computer Science and Juul Labs’ Adam Bowen has a Master’s in Product Design. A total of 39 people have a dual master’s including an MBA such as Christian Chabot of Tableau.

A total of 286 founders earned doctoral degrees such as PhD and MD while 15 have an MBA and a doctoral degree. On the other end of the spectrum the majority of founders only hold a bachelor’s degree while the rest are dropouts.

This research suggests that academic qualifications even a bachelor’s can play an important role in one’s career.

Photos and videos showing piles of empty boxes littered alongside rail tracks in Los Angeles County California have gone viral as shipping companies say they’ve seen a dramatic spike in railroad theft. Some of the boxes are packages from companies like UPS Amazon and FedEx.

Union Pacific one of the country’s largest railroad companies says it may avoid operating in Los Angeles County following the spike in thefts which it blames on lax prosecution of crimes. The containers and trains are locked but can be broken into.

Union Pacific said last month in a letter to the Los Angeles District Attorney that it saw a 160% year-over-year increase in theft in LA county. The company claims that a December 2020 special directive issued by District Attorney George Gascón that changed how low-level offenses are prosecuted has contributed to the uptick.

Union Pacific said in its letter that in the last three months of the year it made over 100 arrests of “active criminals vandalizing our trains” in partnership with the LA police department and Los Angeles Sherriff department. But Union Pacific which has its own police department with jurisdiction over the 32000 miles of tracks it owns said that even as it has expanded its security resources and partnered more closely with local law enforcement the problem isn’t going away. After being arrested individuals are released from custody within 24 hours it said.

Crime is associated with increases in poverty which has increased during the pandemic. The county’s directive was intended to combat social ills that come from misdemeanor convictions such as difficulties with employment housing education government benefits and immigration.

“Studies show that prosecution of the offenses driving the bulk of misdemeanor cases have minimal or even negative long-term impacts on public safety” Gascón said when the directive was issued.

“Our office is committed to working with law enforcement to ensure collective safety across Los Angeles County’s sprawling infrastructure whether it’s at our ports or on railroad tracks” Alex Bastian Special Advisor to District Attorney Gascón said when reached for comment.

“Some cases presented to our office by Union Pacific have been filed such as burglary and grand theft while others have been declined due to insufficient evidence. We make charging decisions based on the evidence. Our office takes Union Pacific’s concerns seriously and hopes to discuss this issue more in the coming weeks” he added.

“While we understand the well-intended social justice goals of the policy we need our justice system to support our partnership efforts with local law enforcement hold these criminals accountable and most important help protect our employees and the critical local and national rail network” Guerrero said.

Amazon was the first brand to launch one of these smart speakers with a built-in screen back in 2017 with the original Echo Show boasting a 10.1-inch display.

Since then Amazon has expanded the Echo Show range with new iterations of the 10.1in form factor the most recent of which is the Echo Show 10 .

It has also launched several smaller smart displays such as the Echo Show 5 (2nd gen) and the Echo Show 8 (2nd gen ). However it’s never attempted to launch a bigger smart display...until now.

The Echo Show 15 went on sale in late 2021 and in a departure from previous Echo Show smart displays the Show 15 is designed to be wall-mounted. It can be used as a freestanding unit but requires a stand that comes at extra expense.

Given that the two smart displays have the same price tag of $249 / £239.99 / AU$399 is bigger really better? We pitted the Echo Show 15 against the Echo Show 10 to find out so you can confidently choose the smart display that suits you.

The Echo Show 10 is available worldwide but while the Echo Show 15 is currently on sale in the US and the UK in Australia it’s still being billed as ‘coming soon’ and Amazon was unable to confirm to us the exact date it will be made available for purchase.

As we’ve already mentioned while the Echo Show 10 is freestanding the Echo Show 15 is designed to be wall-mounted. An optional stand is available so it can be used on a surface or side but this is priced at $29.99 / £29.99 / AU$49.99 making the Echo Show 15 slightly costlier if you don’t want it freestanding or you live outside without any walls.

When it comes to rival smart displays the Google Nest Hub Max  which also has a 10-inch screen is slightly more affordably priced at $229 / £219 / $349. However Google doesn’t offer any bigger smart displays that rival the Echo Show 15.

Design

The screen sizes aren’t the only thing that differs between the Amazon Echo Show 15 and the Echo Show 10 - they actually look dramatically different. The Amazon Echo Show 15 is a rectangular smart display that can be used in either portrait or landscape mode.

In a style similar to a picture frame the Show 15 has a thick black bezel while the 1980 x 1080 15.6-inch display is positioned in the center of a white surround with the camera lens located in the top right-hand corner of the screen (if it's used in Portrait mode).

As we’ve mentioned already the Show 15 is designed to be wall-mounted but an optional stand is also available so it can be placed on a countertop for example.

The Show 10 meanwhile is a freestanding smart display with a cylindrical base wrapped in grey mesh fabric. The 10.1-inch screen which has a resolution of 1280 x 800 is positioned on top of the base and can be titled to ensure it's at the best angle for you to see no matter where it's placed.

Given the large screen size it's no surprise that the Amazon Echo Show 15 has a bigger footprint too measuring 15.8 x 9.9 x 1.4 inches (w x h x d) compared to the Echo Show 10 which at 9.9 x 9 x 6.7 inches is more compact.

Both devices are mains-powered and when it comes to sound the Echo Show 10 has two one-inch tweeters and a three-inch woofer all of which are contained in the cylindrical base.

The Echo Show 15 doesn’t quite have the same audio capability and relies on two 1.6 inch speakers which can be found in the back of the smart display.

The pair also differ when it comes to their built-in cameras too. The Echo Show 10 has a 13MP camera that will automatically pan and zoom and the screen also rotates to ensure you’re always in the center of the frame during video calls even when moving about the room.

The Show 15 doesn’t offer the same camera-tracking capability - the sensor is lower quality at 5MP and doesn't offer the same pan and zoom functionality.

However both smart displays offer a privacy shutter that cuts the power to the microphone while covering the camera lens for those that want the peace of mind that their every move isn’t being watched.

Features

When it comes to the most basic tasks you’d use a smart display for the pair are evenly matched.

Alexa is built into both obviously and on the test we had the same responses to the questions we posed to the voice assistant although the Show 15 has Amazon’s latest processor - dubbed the AZ2 Neural Edge which can recognize voices better meant. This meant we found requests were picked up a second or two faster than when using the Echo Show 10.

On test the Show 15 also didn’t pick up nearly as many false activations (when Alexa starts listening without you saying the wake word) as the Echo Show 10.

Both smart displays also offer a visual interpretation on screen of any responses Alexa provides to your queries as well as offering the ability to listen to music streaming services including Spotify and Prime Music or watch Netflix and Prime Video on the screen.

However while the Echo Show 15 screen is higher resolution which results in a sharper picture than on the Echo Show 10 neither is good enough to replace your TV for entertainment.

The Echo Show 15 is the only one of the two smart displays to offer widgets. These small blocks of information such as upcoming appointments an update on how long your commute is for the day a TV show you’re watching or even a to-do list for everyone in the household can be added to the screen so they can be viewed at a glance. There are around 12 widgets available at present although more are expected in the future.

However we found that you weren’t able to adjust the size of the widgets which meant as they vary in size some were not always immediately visible.

Widgets ensure the Echo Show 15 can double as a family hub - or digital pinboard that allows everyone in the household to see digital sticky notes to-do lists or other information at a glance.

As we’ve already mentioned the Echo Show 10 is only one of the pair that has a moving screen. As you move around the room it will follow you so it’s always within your gaze so whether you’re following a recipe when cooking in the kitchen or staying in touch with friends and family by video call the screen will never be out of your sight.

Verdict

When it comes to choosing between the Amazon Echo Show 15 and the Echo Show 10 as both smart displays perform the most basic tasks equally and cost the same it really comes down to how you plan to use it as to which you should opt for.

For those that want a smart display that offers the biggest screen possible or can be wall-mounted the Echo Show 15 is the best choice. It’s also the better option for those that want a family hub offering a way for everyone in the home to see important information such as the chores for the day shopping lists or even reminders about after-school clubs parties and other appointments.

However for those that want a freestanding smart display for a countertop or other surface or prefer a smaller device the Echo Show 10 is the one to choose. This smart display is also ideal if you plan to make a lot of video calls on the device or use it in the kitchen to follow along with recipes as the rotating screen will ensure it’s always in your eye line even when you move around.

Whichever Amazon smart display you plump for it’ll be sure to make life a little easier meaning you can see information at a glance rather than relying on sticky notes - whether that’s reminders recipes or other information.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53bHR4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZmlyZS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWFtYXpvbi1mYWNpbGl0eS1sZXhpbmd0b24tY291bnR5LzEwMS0xYjM1ZjIwZi00YWE3LTQxODQtYjdkOC1jNzUxNmRhNmJmY2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Fulfillment Center fire investigated in West Columbia | wltx.com,"Authorities said the area of the fire was contained by suppression systems in the building however there was additional smoke and water damage.

LEXINGTON COUNTY S.C. — Fire officials are working to determine what caused a fire at an Amazon distribution facility early Saturday morning.

According to Lexington County Fire Services the fire happened around 4 a.m. at 4400 12th Street Extension in the southern portion of the county. Fire officials said that they arrived to find that the fire had involved a conveyor assembly.

However the fire was extinguished by the building's suppression system. Authorities went on to say that early activation of the sprinkler system limited fire damage to the area where the fire started. That said smoke and water damage were reported in a larger area.

As of late Saturday morning crews were still working to determine the cause of the fire and return the building to full service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYmxvZ3MvbW9kZXJuaXppbmctd2l0aC1hd3Mvc3FsLXNlcnZlci1hbHdheXMtZW5jcnlwdGVkLXdpdGgtc2VjdXJlLWVuY2xhdmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deploying SQL Server Always Encrypted with secure enclaves on Amazon EC2 instances | Amazon Web Services,"Always Encrypted with secure enclaves is an encryption technology available in SQL Server 2019 which allows rich computations on encrypted data. With increased focus on data protection this feature helps customers to protect sensitive data such as credit card numbers or national identification numbers (for example U.S. social security numbers) stored in SQL Server databases.

Always Encrypted allows clients to encrypt sensitive data inside client applications and never reveal the encryption keys to the Database Engine (SQL Database or SQL Server). By using this feature it protects the confidentiality of data from high-privileged users like DBA’s or system admins.

Always Encrypted with secure enclaves feature is dependent on Virtualization-based security (VBS). You can use the following link to discover and launch instances with compatible Amazon provided AMIs in the Amazon EC2 console.

In this tutorial we implement Always Encrypted with secure enclaves on Amazon EC2 Windows instances.

1. Prerequisites

Amazon EC2 Windows instance to run Host Guardian Service which is required for enclave attestation.

Launch Amazon EC2 instance that supports VBS. Install SQL Server in the launched instance.

2. Tutorial

Host Guardian Service (HGS) is a Windows Server role introduced in Windows Server 2016 for configuration of guarded hosts and shielded VM’s. This role provides Attestation and Key Protection services. Key Protection service is used to provide the transport key to unlock and run shielded VM’s.

Now let us set up Always Encrypted with secure enclaves on AWS. For this scenario I’m using an Amazon EC2 m5.xlarge instance type for deploying the Host Guardian Service and an Amazon EC2 m5n.xl instance for deploying SQL Server.

2.1. Configure the Host Guardian Service on Amazon EC2 HGS instance

Log into the Amazon EC2 HGS instance as an administrator and run the following steps using an elevated Windows PowerShell console:

Install HostGuardianServiceRole by running the following command. This will restart the instance. Install-WindowsFeature -Name HostGuardianServiceRole -IncludeManagementTools -Restart

After the reboot log back into Amazon EC2 HGS instance as an administrator. Configure Host guardian service and its domain by running the following command using appropriate Password and Domain Name. This will restart the instance. $adminPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText 'Password' -Force Install-HgsServer -HgsDomainName 'Domain Name' -SafeModeAdministratorPassword $adminPassword -Restart After the reboot log back into Amazon EC2 HGS instance as an administrator. Configure host key attestation by running the following command. Initialize-HgsAttestation -HgsServiceName 'hgs' -TrustHostKey

2.2. Set up Amazon EC2 SQL Server instance

Login to the Amazon EC2 SQL Server instance as an administrator. Run the following steps using an elevated Windows PowerShell console:

Install Windows feature HostGuardian by running the following command. This will install HostGuardian feature and bring up dialog presented in Figure 1; click Yes to restart the computer Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName HostGuardian -All After the reboot log back into Amazon EC2 SQL Server instance as an administrator. Run the following command to create hostkey certificate which will be used for attestation between Amazon EC2 HGS instance and Amazon EC2 SQL Server instance. Create hostkey certificate in your desired location. Set-HgsClientHostKey Get-HgsClientHostKey -Path $HOME\Desktop\hostkey.cer After running the above commands as shown in Figure 2 hostkey certificate is created in the location specified. Copy and paste the hostkey certificate from Amazon EC2 SQL Server instance to desktop on the Amazon EC2 HGS instance. Run the following command to initialize the attestation on Amazon EC2 HGS instance. Initialize-HgsAttestation -HgsServiceName 'hgs' -TrustHostKey Log back into Amazon EC2 SQL Server instance and run the following command to set up attestation between Amazon EC2 SQL Server instance and Amazon EC2 HGS instance.10.50.3.43 is the IP address of my Amazon EC2 HGS instance. Set-HgsClientConfiguration -AttestationServerUrl http://10.50.3.43/Attestation -KeyProtectionServerUrl http://10.50.3.43/KeyProtection/

After executing the above command as shown in Figure 3 the attestation status should be passed. That signifies trust between SQL EC2 instance and HGS EC2 instance is successfully established.

2.3. Configure Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves on SQL Server Database

Log into Amazon EC2 SQL Server instance and connect to SQL Database Engine using SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS). Open a new query window and execute the following script to set enclave type to Virtualization Based Security (VBS) which is needed for Secure Enclaves: EXEC sys.sp_configure 'column encryption enclave type' 1; RECONFIGURE; Restart SQL Server instance by right-clicking on SQL instance name in Object Explorer and select Restart for the previous configuration change to take effect. Once the instance restarts reconnect to it. Open new query window in SSMS and execute the following script to create a database named AESEDemo with test records to encrypt later. CREATE DATABASE [AESEDemo] Go USE [AESEDemo] GO CREATE TABLE [dbo].[AESETest] ( [AESETestID] [int] IDENTITY(11) NOT NULL [SSN] [char](11) NOT NULL FullName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL ) USE [AESEDemo] GO INSERT INTO [dbo].[AESETest] ([SSN][FullName]) VALUES('123-45-6789' N'Vikas') ('145-93-3242' N'Steve') ('134-12-4356' N'John'); To use Always Encrypted Column Master Key (CMK) and Column Encryption Key (CEK) needs to be created. Users who have access to these certificates can decrypt the data. CMK is used to protect one or more CEK’s which are used to protect and encrypt data in the columns.

To create CMK expand the Security tab in database AESEDemo and navigate to option called Always Encrypted Keys.

As shown in Figure 4 right-click on Always Encrypted Keys and select New Column Master Key

After selecting New Column Master Key a new dialog will appear with an option to enter the name of the master key and option to select Key store as shown in Figure 5. For this tutorial we defined Master Key name as CMK and selected Windows Certificate Store – Current User as Key Store. Enable Allow enclave computations. Select Generate certificate and then choose Ok.

Note: If you are unable to enable Allow enclave computations  make sure you are using the correct EC2 AMI listed here.

Next step is to create Column Encryption Key. Expand the Security tab in database AESEDemo and navigate to option called Always Encrypted Keys. Under Always Encrypted option right-click on Column Encryption Keys to create CEK as shown in Figure 6.

After creating CMK and CEK’s successfully it’s time to encrypt the data in the database using these keys.

To encrypt the column data in a table connect to new SSMS instance and connect to SQL server Database Engine with Always Encrypted option selected as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7. Enable Always Encrypted Option on SSMS

After connecting to SQL server instance open a new query window and execute the following SQL statements to encrypt the SSN column. There are two encryption types - Deterministic and Randomized. Deterministic encryption will generate the same cipher-text value for the same clear-text value every time. Randomized will generate different cipher-text value every time we run a select statement. For this tutorial I used Randomized encryption type. USE AESEDemo; GO ALTER TABLE [dbo].[AESETest] ALTER COLUMN [SSN] [char] (11) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2 ENCRYPTED WITH (COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK] ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL; To test whether data is encrypted or not open a new SSMS instance and connect to SQL Database Engine without Always Encrypted option selected and execute the following query. As shown in Figure 8 the information in SSN Column is encrypted.

select [AESETestID] [SSN] [FullName] from AESETest

Figure 8. Enable Always Encrypted Attestation Option on SSMS

Execute the same query in SSMS instance with Always Encrypted option selected. As shown in Figure 9 the information in SSN Column is decrypted. select [AESETestID] [SSN] [FullName] from AESETest

Conclusion

In this tutorial we have seen how to set up Always Encrypted with secure enclaves in Amazon EC2 instances. Always Encrypted protects the confidentiality of sensitive data and Always Encrypted with secure enclaves expands confidential computing capabilities of Always Encrypted by enabling in-place encryption and richer confidential queries.

The basins at Ameren’s Labadie Energy Center in Franklin County hold millions of cubic yards of waste left from decades of burning coal.

Though the coal ash basins are now closed environmental advocates have long called for tighter permitting regulations on the waste that remains arguing it threatens the surrounding area. But a permit issued last month by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources now explicitly authorizes Labadie’s ash basins to discharge pollutants into “waters of the state” for the next five years alarming nearby residents.

The latest permit is a striking departure from previous versions which did not specifically address coal ash pollution at the Labadie plant said Tara Rocque an attorney with the Washington University Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic .

“What DNR did is they gave Ameren a permit to pollute the Missouri River” Rocque said. “This is discharge that has been occurring for decades on a daily basis and will continue for decades unless it’s stopped.”

Considered one of the most common types of industrial waste in the U.S. coal ash contains cancer-causing chemicals and other toxins including arsenic cadmium and mercury. Without careful management pollutants can leach into groundwater and surrounding waterways.

Brian Munoz / St. Louis Public Radio Unlike previous versions a new operating permit for the Labadie Energy Center issued by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources specifically allows discharge of pollutants from the plant's two coal ash basins known as LCPA and LCPB for the next five years.

In response to a federal order from the Environmental Protection Agency Ameren closed the two coal ash basins at Labadie in 2020 and covered them with high-density plastic soil and turf. Labadie’s coal ash ponds contain about 15 million cubic yards of waste according to estimates from the utility — the largest volume of Ameren’s four coal-fired power plants in Missouri.

The ash basins are located near the Missouri River the main source of drinking water for St. Louis city residents.

But Ameren officials say the coal ash basins pose little risk to drinking water or river ecosystems. In 2018 a Boston-based consulting firm hired by the utility found “no adverse impacts on human health” from the ash ponds in line with previous studies commissioned by Ameren.

At the Labadie plant Ameren plans to roll out a system that pumps water from the ground near the ash basins removes toxins and reinjects it underground — a technique tested last year at the utility’s Rush Island Energy Center near Festus.

The utility also maintains a network of groundwater monitoring wells around the facility from which water samples are collected and tested for pollutants said Craig Giesmann Ameren’s environmental services manager. “We always want to do the right thing for the environment” he said. “We live and work in these same communities.”

Still some Labadie residents have become increasingly frustrated with what they view as a deference among state officials toward Ameren.

Brian Munoz / St. Louis Public Radio Patricia Schuba president of the Labadie Environmental Organization on Tuesday Jan. 11 2022 near Ameren’s coal-driven Labadie Energy Center in Labadie Missouri. Environmental advocates say unlined pits of coal ash waste from the plant are leaching heavy metals and other carcinogens into drinking water.

For Patricia Schuba DNR’s decision to explicitly allow groundwater pollution from Ameren’s coal ash basins at the Labadie plant was “infuriating.”

“We all realize the influence this company has over state politics” said Schuba who heads the Labadie Environmental Organization a grassroots coalition of local residents advocating for stricter regulations on the plant. “In the beginning we were very hopeful that by engaging with our state regulators we could get these things fixed. I’ve come to understand that our regulators are literally kept on a leash by politics.”

A spokesperson for DNR declined an interview request from St. Louis Public Radio but said in an emailed statement that groundwater pollution from the coal ash basins had been implicitly allowed under previous permits and that the updated permit language was meant to clarify that.

“The previous permit acknowledged discharge to groundwater by implementing groundwater sampling requirements” the statement read. DNR officials said new language was added to provide clarity because “during the 2021 public comment period it was evident that individuals were unclear that sampling requirements were a way to monitor the discharge to sub-surface water.”

The statement went on to say “When a permit contains monitoring requirements and no obvious discharge prohibition was included in the permit the permit allows that discharge.”

In other words by requiring Ameren to test the groundwater near the Labadie plant DNR officials said previous permits effectively allowed coal ash pollution — despite the fact that it had not been explicitly included in the permit language.

The permit will remain in effect until Nov. 30 2026.

Is this just another case of egregious selective enforcement of AA’s nebulous dress code?

Olivia Culpo Busted By American Airlines For Wardrobe Choice

Once again American Airlines’ vague dress code was used by a gate agent to deny a female passenger from boarding a flight. This time it was 29-year-old Olivia Culpo the 2012 Miss USA and Miss Universe winner who has become a small-c celebrity through her pageantry modeling and dating of Nick Jonas Tim Tebow and currently Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey.

In an Instagram video posted by her sister Aurora who was traveling with her Culpo’s “offending” outfit is shown a sports bra and shorts.

﻿

American Airlines’ dress code simply states:

Dress appropriately; bare feet or offensive clothing aren’t allowed.

A gate agent found her wardrobe choice to be inappropriate and told her to cover up. She ended up putting on her boyfriend’s sweater.

But here’s the twist: it appears that a black passenger on the same flight with a different body type but wearing a substantially similar outfit was not told to cover up. Check the video above.

If true it just goes to show how arbitrary AA’s dress code policy is. As I’ve said before the “I’ll know it when I see it” approach inevitably leads to conflict and leaves passengers at the mercy of flight attendants and gate agents all of whom have different standards of what is “appropriate” or “offensive.” As for Culpo’s outfit it covered up private parts and was not vulgar so I’m not sure what the problem is even if I personally wish all passengers would cover up.

Meanwhile Culpo’s boyfriend was apparently cold without his sweater and drew a complaint from another passenger (or busybody on Twitter) when he failed to wear a mask properly:

@AmericanAir so it seems @CMC_22 doesn’t have to wear his mask properly but us regularly folks have to wear them or be threatened with be kicked off the flight. Or does 1st class allow them to avoid the @CDCgov and @FAANews mask mandate? pic.twitter.com/kUybE2iGvd — David (@jd031185) January 14 2022

Finally it merits mentioning this whole thing could be a publicity stunt that Culpo is using in an attempt to stay relevant. Obviously if so mission accomplished…

CONCLUSION

Once again it appears we have another incident of selective enforcement on American Airlines concerning the dress and appearance of a female passenger. I continue to be of the opinion that absent the exposure of reproductive organs or vulgar messaging passengers should be allowed to wear what they please even if most deem it skimpy or inappropriate.

Then Will Come the Hard Part,"A plan to sell rather than close the largest coal-fired power plant in North Dakota is nearly final. The completion of the sale would allow the buyer to move on to the much greater challenge of making the plant financially viable and installing a carbon capture system.

Great River Energy of Minnesota originally planned to close the plant Coal Creek Station after years of financial losses but the company changed course and decided to sell the plant after intense pressure from elected officials in North Dakota. State officials have been zealous in trying to preserve coal jobs to the point that they helped to arrange the sale and hope to use government subsidies to help retrofit the plant with a carbon capture system.

The efforts by officials to keep the plant open is part of a larger pattern of state and local governments from Montana to West Virginia downplaying concerns about the high costs and emissions from burning coal and working to secure a future for coal mines and coal-fired power plants. In some of those places the coal industry and government leaders are embracing carbon capture despite warnings from energy analysts that this a costly investment that is unlikely to be successful at substantially cutting emissions.

The last major step for the Coal Creek sale will be a vote in early February by boards of directors of rural cooperative utilities across Minnesota on whether to approve a revised sales contract between Great River and the buyer Rainbow Energy Marketing of North Dakota. The revised contract includes a provision to allow delivery of wind energy from North Dakota to Minnesota and a small increase in Great River’s financial commitment to continue to buy coal power from the plant.

Minnesota environmental advocates have opposed the sale every step of the way.

“We need somebody to be held accountable” said Veda Kanitz an environmental advocate who also is a customer of one of the co-ops Dakota Electric Association that receives power from the plant. “We’re not seeing a true risk-benefit analysis. And I don’t think they’re properly factoring in the climate impacts.”

Kanitz and other opponents are upset that Great River has agreed to buy electricity from the plant as a condition of the sale which she thinks is not in the best interests of customers. The revised sale agreement says Great River will pay to receive 1050 megawatts—nearly all of the plant’s generating capacity—until the end of 2022 and then receive up to 350 megawatts from the plant for eight years after that.

Great River executives say they are trying to balance the need to reduce emissions with an effort to retain jobs at the plant and the adjacent coal mine in North Dakota.

“We understand the economic impact and the social impact of what a closure event would be and what that would mean for the communities and the people out there” said Zac Ruzycki Great River’s director of resource planning.

The New Sale Agreement

Great River based outside of Minneapolis manages the supply of electricity to 28 rural electric cooperatives that serve about 700000 customers. The company is asking its member co-ops to approve the revised contract with Rainbow Energy.

One of the reasons for the new contract is that the previous agreement which the co-ops voted to approve in July expired because the sale had not been completed by Dec. 31 2021. (Connexus Energy the largest of Great River’s co-ops was the only member to vote against the sale citing financial and environmental concerns.)

The main reason for the delay was that the plant sale also includes the sale of the 436-mile interstate power line that connects the plant to the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area and the line sale needed to be approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Minnesota. Rather than issue a quick approval the commission delayed the decision and asked for additional information from Rainbow Energy in response to concerns raised by opponents of the sale who questioned whether Rainbow was qualified to own the line.

This is the same power line which the construction of in the 1970s led to a years-long uprising by Minnesota farmers who didn’t want the line to run through their communities.

On Jan. 6 the commission voted to approve the transfer saying that Rainbow had shown it was qualified to cover costs related to owning the line.

The upshot is that the supporters of the sale have now cleared every major obstacle except for the co-ops’ vote on the new contract which is taking place in February with many co-ops voting on Feb. 9.

The new contract contains some differences from the previous version. In addition to setting the terms of the sale of the plant and the power line the new contract says that Rainbow Energy will allow Great River to use the power line to deliver 400 megawatts of wind power to be developed near the plant. The wind power will have priority on the line even if that sometimes means displacing coal power.

Ruzycki of Great River said his company had wanted to include a provision about wind power in the original sale contract but couldn’t come to an agreement with Rainbow. The parties continued to discuss this and were able to agree as they worked on the revised contract.

Great River has been in discussions with a developer that would build the wind farm. Ruzycki declined to provide additional details but said more information will be available as soon as in the next few days.

Another change with the new contract is that Great River is agreeing to buy up to 350 megawatts of the coal plant’s capacity for eight years starting in 2023 a change from the previous contract which called for Great River to buy 300 megawatts during this period.

Ruzycki said Great River agreed to this because the company was responding to the concerns of some member co-ops about having access to enough electricity sources that were available around the clock.

Great River’s commitment to buy power from Coal Creek includes conditions that require Rainbow to work toward installing a carbon capture system and eventually successfully deploy the system.

Rainbow Energy is a subsidiary of United Energy Corp. of North Dakota a business that is mainly active in the oil and gas industry. Executives of the company declined to be interviewed.

But Rainbow said in a news release that it expects to close the sale no earlier than May 1 and then would begin work on the multi-year process of designing and installing a carbon capture system.

Opposition to Wind Energy May Be Thawing

The addition of wind power to the sale agreement is significant because it follows a period when local officials near the plant were hostile to wind energy because they viewed it as competition for coal.

Great River announced in May 2020 that it was planning to close Coal Creek and would replace some of the electricity by developing wind farms in the same part of North Dakota with the electricity to be delivered on the power line that serves the coal plant.

In response local leaders in McClean County where the plant is located placed a moratorium on new wind farms which would mean the power line would have no power to deliver once the coal plant closed.

The moratorium along with the involvement of North Dakota state leaders helped to push Great River to focus instead on finding a buyer for the plant and the line. In March 2021 North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum a Republican announced that Great River had entered exclusive negotiations with a prospective buyer of the plant which he hailed as “wonderful news.”

His office and the office of Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford had been deeply involved in the process with several years of public statements and behind-the-scenes organizing to put Great River and Rainbow together and help them come to an agreement.

McClean County leaders have said they would be willing to lift the wind energy moratorium as long as any development takes place alongside a plan to keep Coal Creek open. The officials say they are mainly concerned with preserving the roughly 700 jobs that are tied to the plant and the mine.

This turn of events is infuriating for environmental advocates who say the best course of action would be to close the plant and focus exclusively on developing renewable energy. But the leaders of unions like Laborers’ International Union of North America say the proposed sale is the best possible outcome.

Kevin Pranis an official with the union said that closing the plant was fueling the idea that renewable energy was a job-killer and ran the risk of setting back renewable energy development in North Dakota for years. The union has members that do maintenance at power plants including Coal Creek and at wind farms.

As he sees it Rainbow Energy deserves a chance to see if it can make carbon capture work at Coal Creek.

“I think we’re moving forward finally” he said.

State Leaders Working to Preserve Coal

North Dakota is one of several states in which leaders have been aggressive in trying to preserve jobs in the coal industry even though there are alternatives that are less expensive and produce lower emissions.

Officials in Montana West Virginia and Wyoming among others have taken steps to slow the closing of coal plants using state laws or regulatory actions. One example is the ongoing legal battle in Montana over Colstrip Power Plant with a capacity of about 1500 megawatts. A group of Oregon and Washington utilities that are majority owners of the plant want to close it citing financial and environmental concerns. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2021 that changed the plant’s ownership agreement in ways that impeded the closing and favored the minority owners that wanted to keep it open. The law is now being challenged in court.

In almost all cases the costs of continuing to operate old coal plants are being passed on to utility ratepayers.

“The problem is our government is captive” said Scott Skokos executive director of Dakota Resource Council an environmental advocacy group based in Bismarck.

He means that fossil fuel industries exert a strong enough influence on government that officials are often acting as advocates for the industries and are not thinking enough about the long-term public good.

‘These Are Not Good Projects’

For people who follow attempts to develop carbon capture technology the idea of retrofitting Coal Creek with carbon capture makes little sense: Its costs will easily exceed $1 billion and the project will have a low chance of capturing much carbon dioxide.

“The track record is not great on the technology” said Eric Gimon a senior fellow at the think tank Energy Innovation.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office listed some of the challenges in a report issued in December saying that government incentives for carbon capture have led to projects that have almost all failed.

But that doesn’t mean Rainbow is going to lose money on the deal. The government provides tax incentives for carbon capture based on the tonnage of carbon that is buried or repurposed. If it is passed the Build Back Better legislation currently stalled in Congress might change the terms of those incentives to increase the payments.

This creates the possibility that projects like the one envisioned at Coal Creek could generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year in incentives for the owners which might make the plant financially viable.

Also Rainbow can make money with the interstate power line a valuable asset for delivering electricity to Minnesota at a time when the grid doesn’t have enough interstate lines.

But focusing on whether the plant’s owners will make money is missing the larger point Gimon said. At a time when the United States needs to drastically cut carbon dioxide emissions he doesn’t think it makes sense to spend sizable sums of money to extend the lives of old coal plants.

“No these are not good projects” he said.

The United States has a lithium supply problem. Nearly every major automaker has announced a transition to electric vehicles Tesla delivered almost one million cars in 2021 and a handful of new electric vehicle companies like Rivian and Lucid are rolling new models off the line. In order to power all of these EVs we will need batteries — lots of them. Electric vehicle growth will be responsible for more than 90% of demand for lithium by 2030 according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. But lithium is also in our phones computers ceramics lubricants pharmaceuticals and is essential for solar and wind energy storage. ""It's like the blood in your body"" said Lithium Americas CEO Jon Evans ""It's the chemistry behind how lithium-ion batteries work. It remains the common denominator in all the battery technologies even that we're looking at now for next generation batteries. So it's truly a critical element."" This vital mineral in rechargeable batteries has earned the name ""white gold"" and the rush is on. The price of lithium is soaring up 280% since Jan. 2021 and establishing a domestic supply of lithium has become the modern-day version of oil security. But today the U.S. is far behind with only 1% of global lithium being mined and processed in the U.S. according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

More than 80% of the world's raw lithium is mined in Australia Chile and China. And China controls more than half of the world's lithium processing and refining and has three-fourths of the lithium-ion battery megafactories in the world according to the International Energy Agency. But until the 1990s the U.S. was the leader in lithium production. ""The lithium industry started in the U.S. and had a good run for 50 years"" said Erick Neuman the international business manager for with Swenson Technology. ""We do have a lot. The challenge is can we produce what we need at an economical and competitive price? That's hard."" Lithium is not a scarce element. The U.S. holds almost 8 million metric tons in reserve ranking it among the top five countries in the world according to the USGS. But there is only one operating lithium mine in the U.S. Albemarle 's Silver Peak in Nevada. Last June the administration released a blueprint for jumpstarting domestic lithium production and refining as well as battery manufacturing and set a national EV sales goal of 50% by 2030. There are several domestic lithium projects in the works in Nevada North Carolina California and Arkansas among other places.

A Lithium Americas worker processes lithium at the company's Reno Nevada R&D lab.

Controlled Thermal Resources is developing a lithium project at the Salton Sea in California which will extract lithium out of brine pumped up via geothermal energy plants in the area. The Salton Sea was once a hot tourist destination but has become one of the worst environmental and public health crises in modern history as drier conditions caused a lot of the lake to dry up. The state of California is trying to transform the area calling it ""Lithium Valley"" and it hopes to generate the revenue needed to revive the area. Last summer GM announced a multi-million-dollar investment in Controlled Thermal Resources and has secured first rights to purchase the domestically produced lithium for its EVs."

“What makes it special is kind of what happens during the week” said Finau a two-time tour winner and three-time U.S. Ryder Cup player who will be one of the high-profile names in The American Express in La Quinta this week. “To have concerts like that and meet the great people at the pro-am it is a different field than most events we have. You meet people I have maybe admired or looked up to in music or the entertainment industry. So I have those opportunities during this event. And I love the golf courses that we play.”

None of the things Finau loves about The American Express can happen without the backing of a title sponsor like American Express. One of the largest financial corporations in the world American Express has had two years as sponsor of the desert’s PGA Tour event but those years have hardly been normal years by sports sponsorship standards.

American Express joined the desert tournament just four months before the January 2020 event meaning most of the plans for that year were already in place. In 2021 the second of the five-year deal between American Express and the tournament the marketing and hospitality opportunities a sponsor like American Express craves were wiped out when the event’s three-day pro-am was canceled and no gallery was allowed on the two courses used for the event because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It certainly has been an interesting two years in the world for all of us hasn’t it"" said Bess Spaeth senior vice president global brand media and experiences for American Express. “Fortunately we have been able to lay the groundwork on what we set out to do with our partnership driving fan excitement on and off the course and giving back to the local community.”

With fans back at the tournament this week and with the pro-am and two nights of concerts restored American Express has its first real chance in 2022 to make an imprint on the 63-year-old desert tournament. From a major purse increase to a shift in the musical acts in the concert series American Express is creating a new buzz around the tournament.

“Given the ever-changing environment planning and preparation these days involves being more nimble than ever” Spaeth said. “However from bringing in world-renowned artists to elevate the long-standing concert series to attracting one of the strongest professional field of players in recent years we are consistently bringing to life experiences that show fans cardmembers and the local community how we’ve enhanced The American Express through our partnership.”

Reviving the tournament

It’s possible to argue that the desert’s PGA Tour event might not still exist without American Express striking a deal with the tournament and the PGA Tour to become the title sponsor in September 2019. The desert event was struggling at that time with CareerBuilder dropping its name off the tournament earlier that year as it ended its sponsorship deal early while still providing the millions of dollars needed to operate and televise a tournament.

The 2019 tournament was called the Desert Classic but the local event was not assured a life beyond the 2020 event before American Express stepped in.

“They are a fantastic title sponsor on so many fronts” said Pat McCabe executive director of the tournament for management company SportFive. “We wouldn’t be here without them. We wouldn’t be here without their vision and guidance and desires to elevate the experience.”

The desert tournament is hardly American Express’ first venture into golf. From 1999 through 2006 the global financial company was the title sponsor of a World Golf Championship event that was played first in Spain then Ireland and later the United States. Since then American Express has been a corporate sponsor for the United States Golf Association including having a large presence at the U.S. Open.

American Express’ impact on the 2022 event can be seen in several areas. The purse for this year has been increased to $7.6 million up $900000 from last year’s event that was played with no ticket sales and no pro-am.

The concert series also has changed with an emphasis on attracting a younger audience. That series featured classic rock acts in 2018 and 2019 with Sammy Hagar and Huey Lewis and the News as well as Stevie Nicks and country star Luke Bryan in 2020. This year’s series includes rock act Maroon 5 with lead singer Adam Levine on Friday and country star Brad Paisley on Saturday.

“When we became title sponsor of The American Express we knew we wanted to bring exciting experiences to fans and cardmembers because creating these special moments for our cardmembers is how we show customers life is better with AmEx” Spaeth said. “And we plan on providing great experiences at the tournament in the Coachella Valley for years to come. Between the concert series on-site activations and having some of the best golfers in the world participating there’s something for all fans at this year’s event.”

Cardholders with American Express receive extra benefits at the tournament from a 20% discount on tickets to special seating areas for the concerts.

Another key to American Express’ sponsorship has been local charitable contributions. With no revenue from ticket sales or pro-am sales in 2021 the tournament through The Mickelson Foundation the overseeing organization of the event still donated $1.1 million to 36 desert charities in November. McCabe said that was mostly because of American Express.

“They are adamant about small businesses here in the community” McCabe said. “They are adamant about keeping money here in the community. That is super important to them.”

“Supporting local communities is a key pillar at American Express and the foremost mission of the tournament is being able to give back to the Coachella Valley community” Spaeth said. “While COVID-19 caused the tournament to make some changes last year our joint priority was still to support the local Coachella Valley community.”

For Finau who is one of several golfers who represent American Express on the PGA Tour what the company adds to a tournament makes the desert tournament worth playing.

“You kind of mash it all up and that’s the reason I continue to come back and play the American Express” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBnYXRvdXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9uZWVkdG9rbm93LzIwMjIvMDEvMTYvZml2ZS10aGluZ3MtdG8ta25vdy1wZ2Etd2VzdC1zdGFkaXVtLWNvdXJzZS10aGUtYW1lcmljYW4tZXhwcmVzc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five things to know: PGA West's Stadium Course - PGA TOUR,“There’s been a lot of controversy about PGA West this week.

After all this is a player who worked his way through PGA Tour qualifying in 2012 when he was just 17 years old. That meant Kim had to wait until his 18th birthday before officially joining the tour in 2013.

Kim also won two tour titles at the age of 21 including the 2017 Players Championship.

So winning the 2021 American Express making him one of the youngest golfers to win the desert’s PGA Tour event was nothing new for Kim. In picking up his third career title Kim won for the first time since the 2017 Players title. But the South Korean star also showed he has the game to compete with even the best on the tour.

More:Count on low scoring for American Express but just how low will golfers go?

Faced with a final-round 11-under 61 by Patrick Cantlay who would go on to win player of the year on the tour Kim made clutch birdies on the 16th and 17th holes for a final-round 64 and a one-shot win over Cantlay. While it was the only win of 2021-22 for Kim it was his third victory before the age of 26.

The title also made Kim one of the five youngest winners of The American Express since it debuted in 1960 with a victory by 30-year-old Arnold Palmer.

Here’s a look at those five youngsters and how they won:

Jack Nicklaus

Year: 1963

Age: 23

Host course: Indian Wells Country Club

Recap: Just two weeks after his 23rd birthday and just six months after winning the U.S. Open in a playoff over Arnold Palmer Nicklaus defeated another member of the Big Three to win his only desert title. Nicklaus held the 72-hole lead in the 90-hole Palm Springs Golf Classic but a 72 in the final round and a 67 by Gary Player tied the two at 15 under for five rounds. Rather than today’s sudden-death playoffs Nicklaus and Player played an 18-hole playoff on Monday at host course Indian Wells. Nicklaus shot 65 in the playoff to beat Player by eight shots. It was the fourth of what would be 73 PGA Tour wins for Nicklaus.

Jon Rahm

Year: 2018

Age: 23

Host course: Stadium Course PGA West

Recap: Just two months after his 23rd birthday Rahm reinforced the idea that he might be the game’s rising superstar with a playoff victory at PGA West. Rahm started the week with a 10-under 62 at La Quinta Country Club and finished with a 67 on the Stadium Course at PGA West. His 72-hole score of 22 under put him in a playoff with Andrew Landry after Landry shot 68 in the final 18 holes. Rahm and Landry played four extra holes each parring the par-4 18th hole the first three times. But with the sun setting behind the Santa Rosa Mountains Rahm rolled in a birdie putt on the final playoff hole for the win the second of his six PGA Tour victories so far.

Patrick Reed

Year: 2014

Age: 23

Host course: Palmer Course PGA West

Recap: Reed was five months older than Nicklaus was in 1963 when Reed blitzed the field at the 2014 event known as the Humana Challenge. Reed shot 63 on the first day of the four-day event then followed with rounds of 63 in the second and third rounds as well for a remarkable 27-under total for just 54 holes two shots better than the tour scoring record for 54 holes. Reed managed just a 71 on the final day but it was still good enough for a two-shot victory over Ryan Palmer. It was the second win of what is now nine tour victories for Reed.

Si Woo Kim

Year: 2021

Age: 25

Host course: Stadium Course PGA West

Recap: In 2020 Kim withdrew from The American Express after a first-round 87 because of a chronic bad back that has plagued him in his career. That bad back never showed up in the 2021 tournament. With an opening-round 66 Kim was near the top of the leader board throughout the week. Kim and Tony Finau were tied for the lead after 54 holes at 15 under but the fourth round belonged to Patrick Cantlay who shot an 11-under 61. That pushed Cantlay to 22 under but Kim grinded out a 64 including critical birdies on the 16th and 17th holes to take the lead. The victory was the third and the most recent win for Kim on the PGA Tour.

Bill Rogers

Year: 1978

Age: 26

Host course: Bermuda Dunes Country Club

Recap: Rogers was certainly one of the hot young stars on the PGA Tour when he arrived at the 1978 Bob Hope Classic but he hadn’t won a tournament since turning pro in 1974. That changed in the 90-hole desert event that week. With an opening-round of 69 followed by three consecutive 67s Rogers built a two-shot lead entering the final round played on a Monday because the third round was postponed by flooding on some courses. A final-round 69 at Bermuda Dunes gave Rogers the two-shot win over Jerry McGee. It was the first of six career tour wins by Rogers including the 1981 British Open. Rogers became the first player to win his first-ever title in the desert tournament.

Honorable mention

Both Craig Stadler (1980) and Jhonattan Vegas (2011) won the desert tournament at 26 though they were older than Rogers when he won in 1978 . . . Johnny Miller won the desert title in 1975 at 27 years old and repeated in 1976 making him the only golfer to win the event twice before the age of 30. . . the oldest winner of the tournament was Bob Rosburg who was 45 when he won the 1972 title.

Major League Baseball’s international signing period opens on Saturday Jan. 15 for the 2021-22 class.

Below we have the signing agreements for all 30 clubs with more to come throughout the day. The same as draft picks or major league free agents none of these players are officially with these clubs until they have a signed contract completed a physical and received approval from the commissioner’s office. Many international players committed to sign with a club years ago with Jan. 15 the first date they can sign an official contract.

There will be a wave of signings on Saturday but a lot of these players will not sign a contract right away on Jan. 15. Some players will sign over the course of the next week others will sign later. That happens in a normal year but more so this year with the pandemic creating more challenges. The signing period is open until Dec. 15 2022.

As players do sign contracts we will share photos of them all day Saturday on our social media pages through Twitter and Instagram.

All 30 teams are listed below with their bonus pools in parentheses. Baseball America subscribers can read scouting reports on the top 50 players on our international bonus board.

Everyone's Fighting.,"With the possible exception of the Megalodon shark (now extinct for at least 3.6 million years) humankind has been the most effective killer of whales in history. A study in 2015 put the final death toll of 20th-century commercial whaling at about 2.9 million before the International Whaling Commission’s ban in 1986 brought it (mostly) to an end.

Remarkably not a single species had gone extinct in the frenzy for oil baleen and ambergris and gradually populations of whales began to fill the oceans again. Some like humpback whales in the western South Atlantic have made a strong recovery. But others haven’t been so lucky.

A slow-moving grazer with a head like a snowplow the North Atlantic right whale is a regular visitor to the New England coast and one of the first species to be hunted by American whalers. The right whale count recovered from 270 whales in 1990 to almost 500 two decades later. But around 2010 numbers began to fall again. The population has declined ever since and currently stands at less than 350. In 2020 the International Union for Conservation of Nature changed the North Atlantic right whale’s status back to “critically endangered.” At least 34 have died since 2017 including four in 2021 alone.

Scientists studying the decline have concluded that humans are to blame. In 2018 an international group of scientists compared the number of North Atlantic right whale calves born each year to the calf counts from three populations of the Southern right whale its nearest relative south of the equator. The Southern rights showed a clear trend upward from 1992 to 2016 but the North Atlantic species couldn’t keep pace. The best explanation wrote the authors was too many dead females.

“Down there the whales get old before they die” says Colleen Coogan marine mammal and sea turtle branch chief at the National Marine Fisheries Service. “Up here right whales don’t live long enough to die of old age.” When a cause can be determined right whale deaths are attributed to one of two culprits: blunt-force injuries and propeller wounds from colliding with ships and a slow death by starvation and infection after becoming tangled in nets and fishing rope. Eighty-six percent of right whales have been entangled at least once according to the New England Aquarium.

New rules are here to save the day. Or are they?

This May new rules created for the lobster industry by the National Marine Fisheries Service (the branch of NOAA responsible for fisheries management) will become official policy for boats operating in right whale territory. NOAA's new rules are part one of a two-phase plan that will take place over 10 years. In phase two the rules will become more strict for the Mid-Atlantic lobster fishery as well as some other East Coast fisheries.

NOAA estimates that lobster and Jonah crab traps are responsible for 95 percent of vertical end-line ropes in the areas where whale protections apply and therefore pose the most risk for entangling whales. The Fisheries Service says these changes will reduce the risk of death and serious injury by 69 percent. But in the months after the rules were finalized the agency has seen pushback from conservation groups who argue the new protections aren’t enough and lobster fishing crews who say the rules will harm their business.

The rules require lobster crews to attach more lobster traps to each line (which would reduce the number of end-line ropes hanging vertically in the water) and to splice sections of “weak rope” into their fishing lines which are designed to break under 1700 pounds of pressure at most. The latter measure is based on research from the New England Aquarium which examined ropes taken from 70 entangled whales and determined that weaker rope could reduce life-threatening entanglements by 72 percent while still being reliable for fishermen.

But the fact that weak rope has not been field-tested worries researchers who would prefer to limit or remove rope from the equation entirely until the species rebounds. “Without that evidence you're kind of undertaking a scientific experiment on this species that’s critically endangered” says Francine Kershaw a staff scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Even if a rope doesn’t kill the whale says Kershaw it can still cause harm especially to calves.

The National Marine Fisheries Service has also designated two new areas along the New England coast that will be seasonally closed to lobster fishing. But conservation groups have argued these closures don’t provide enough protection. For example a restricted area south of Nantucket island would be closed to fishing from February to April. But one analysis of whale sightings released last summer by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the New England Aquarium identified the area as a hot spot for whales in the summer and winter too.

Currently it’s very difficult to prove where whales are getting entangled and this has been a major sticking point during rulemaking. “That’s the big problem no one’s figured out how to solve” says Colleen Coogan. Right whales are highly mobile and difficult to track. Tagging them with GPS devices risks injuring them and so scientists and government agencies rely on sightings from ships and planes as well as underwater microphones to listen for whale songs. To determine where and when lobster fishing should be off-limits the National Marine Fisheries Service used a computer model that cross-references those whale sightings with the location of fishing gear and calculates the risk of entanglement.

The climate crisis has made things more complicated as some whales have been changing their travel habits in response to warming waters. In 2017 at least nine whales died in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada when an influx of migrating whales collided with a busy snow crab fishing season. The area saw few right whales before 2015 but evidence suggests the Gulf is becoming a regular stop on their annual migration. A recent study found that about 40 percent of North Atlantic right whales visited the Gulf of St. Lawrence from 2015 to 2019 with most returning on a yearly basis.

“We’re actually not very good at predicting where they’re going to go” says Peter Corkeron a senior scientist at the New England Aquarium who coauthored the 2018 study comparing the survival rates of North Atlantic right whales and Southern right whales. He believes the new rules will not be enough to reverse the right whale's decline and cites the Endangered Species Act which states that a federal agency cannot allow an activity that “jeopardize[s] the continued existence of endangered or threatened species.”

The National Marine Fisheries Service first concluded that lobster fishing placed the North Atlantic right whale in jeopardy in 2001. After it put new protections in place the agency concluded in several more analyses that the fishery no longer posed a threat even as whale numbers leveled off and began to decline. It took a 2018 lawsuit by the Center for Biological Diversity and other conservation groups to force the agency to come up with the new rules on the grounds that it was violating the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act.

The National Marine Fisheries Service now estimates the whale can lose less than one member per year before it’s on a path to extinction and last February an 11-year-old male named Cottontail died of rope injuries. The agency says their new plan would allow the lobster fishery to operate without placing the whales in jeopardy. But “it’s becoming less and less tenable as these whales blink out that they can keep doing that” says Corkeron.

The view from the lobster boats

Lobster fishers have voiced their own objections saying the new rules unfairly target their industry. “This plan is a lose-lose because it will all but eliminate the Maine lobster fishery yet still fail to save endangered right whales” Patrice McCarron the executive director for the Maine Lobstermen’s Association wrote in an email to Sierra. She takes issue with NOAA’s “one size fits all” approach and believes whale protections should be flexible and tailored to local conditions. The state submitted its own proposal for reducing entanglements but NOAA rejected it saying it did not reduce the risk far enough.

Maine lobster boats landed about 96 million pounds of lobster in 2020 amounting to about $400 million in revenue. Over the past two decades the industry has complied with previous whale protections by making expensive changes to its equipment says McCarron including marking gear replacing floating rope with sinking rope and adding breakable plastic links and weak rope similar to that required by the new rules. And more changes could be on the way.

One source of hope for the right whale is ropeless lobster trap technology which floats to the surface at the press of a button instead of having to be hauled up. But it needs some work. “We've moved beyond it being experimental but it’s still not totally off the shelf” says Katharine Deuel a senior officer for marine conservation at the Pew Charitable Trusts which has supported research on ropeless gear. “These units are being made to order.”

Ropeless lobster traps are also expensive. The price of different models varies but are generally more than a thousand dollars per unit (a regular trap costs about $100). At the moment says McCarron it’s unclear whether the price will go down enough—and whether the gear will work well enough—to keep lobster fishing profitable.

Pew and other groups are advocating for funding from the federal government to help fisheries in North America convert to ropeless traps. “It definitely can't all be put financially onto the fishing industry” says Deuel. Ropeless gear might also help protect other species like humpback whales which are similarly injured by crab-fishing equipment in California. “This transition is something that everyone wants to have happen” says Deuel. “And everyone in some way is responsible for making it happen.”

In the meantime Pew is calling on the government to do more. Along with groups like Environment America and the Georgia Wildlife Federation Pew petitioned Gina Raimondo the US Secretary of Commerce to take emergency action last summer to protect the whales on a timeline faster than NOAA’s 10-year plan. Their requests include more seasonal restricted areas in the Gulf of Maine that they say would provide better protection for right whales while keeping lobster boats in business.

“This is the fork in the road” says Regina Asmutis-Silvia executive director for North America at Whale and Dolphin Conservation adding that she is “trying to find the line between panic that we’re on the verge of losing a species and the fact that they’re viable and there’s hope that they can recover.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkbC5vcmcvcmVzb3VyY2VzL2Jsb2cvc2l4LWZhY3RzLWFib3V0LXRocmVhdHMtamV3aXNoLWNvbW11bml0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Six Facts About Threats to The Jewish Community,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdXN3bnQtZnV0dXJlLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1yb3NlLWxhdmVsbGUtanVsaWUtZm91ZHktanVsaWUtZXJ0ei0yMDIyLTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Women's Soccer Stars on Future of National Team World Cup Success,"The US women's national soccer team is in a period of transition.

With the Tokyo Olympics in the rearview mirror and the World Cup just 18 months away Vlatko Andonovski is weighing all of his options.

The US Women's National Team head coach has opened up the pool of players in the mix for a spot on his squad's roster. From battle-tested veterans and megawatt superstars to in-and-out role players and starry-eyed newcomers a wide array of the country's top players are still in contention just six months ahead of World Cup qualifiers.

The former group — the Megan Rapinoes Alex Morgans Becky Sauerbrunns Tobin Heaths and Christen Presses — are proven entities as World Cup champions and Olympians many times over.

But those who are new to call-ups to the national team or have not suited up for the Stars and Stripes in years are more of a wildcard. They're not as experienced to be sure. But as USWNT legend-turned-ESPN analyst Julie Foudy told Insider ""there's a lot of upside.""

""There is something to be said about that youthfulness — there's just a new spark"" Foudy said. ""So it brings an element that's been missing and that's needed.""

The world got a glimpse at the next generation of the USWNT during a recent trip to Australia

Foudy a longtime national team captain was encouraged by what she saw from the youngsters during their recent trip Down Under. With an average age of 26.2 and a whopping six newcomers without a single cap for the national team the 23-player roster Andonovski brought to Australia for two November friendlies against the Matildas was full of fresh faces.

And the budding stars delivered earning a 3-0 win and a 1-1 draw against a ""really good"" Australia squad playing in front of record crowds in Sydney and Newcastle.

""For us to walk away in their Sydney stadium 3-0 up was a tremendous result"" Foudy said. ""I think [the players] all would say that wasn't even scratching the surface because it's such a new group and there's so much to learn and grow from. But it had to be exciting for Vlatko [Andonovski] and the staff to say okay look at the potential.""

Current USWNT star Julie Ertz — whose hustle and grit has made her an instrumental member of two World Cup squads and two Olympic rosters — got a glimpse of that potential while watching the Australia matches from back home in the states. Since reinvigorating a knee injury at the Tokyo Olympics Ertz has steered the soccer field — and USWNT camps — to rehab in Arizona.

And though she's eager to rejoin the national team and begin the push to the World Cup the 29-year-old defensive midfielder recognizes ""the importance of growing and having younger talent"" on the USWNT.

""Continuing to want the success of the national team is really always first"" Ertz told Insider. ""Being with the team for nine years you understand the cycle of younger players coming in and developing.""

Meanwhile Rose Lavelle — the crafty midfielder who burst onto the international soccer scene with a stunning left-footed goal that capped the USWNT's 2019 World Cup victory — got a first-hand look at the newcomers as one of the most tenured players to take the late-fall trip to Australia. Though she admitted that taking on a leadership role for the national team was ""new territory"" for her Lavelle was really excited by what she saw from the new group.

""We came with a very new lineup. We didn't have a lot of time to prepare. We played a really really good team"" Lavelle told Insider. ""So to come away with those two results while also keeping in mind that we could be so much better was really exciting.""

""It was a good experience for a lot of players to get their first cap or come back into the mix after being gone for a while"" she added. ""It was really cool to get that group together and then come away with the results that we did.""

That group full of players unfamiliar to most casual national team fans features some of the brightest talent and biggest names in the National Women's Soccer League. Both Lavelle and Ertz have spent most of their professional careers playing for clubs within the US-based league so both are intimately familiar with the talent coming up the pipeline to the USWNT.

""It's so funny because... people will say 'new faces' and I understand they're new faces to the national team but I've been able to see and watch the progression of many of these players in the league"" Ertz who was recently traded to Los Angeles-based NWSL expansion club Angel City said. ""To be able to see them on this stage to me is no surprise.""

""It shows how much the league matters"" Lavelle added reflecting on what it was like to see current and former club teammates get called up to the national team. ""I was just excited for them to all get rewarded. And then for all of them to get to play too and have some big moments was obviously really exciting.""

A handful of USWNT newcomers left strong impressions on Foudy Ertz and Lavelle

Ashley Hatch who played alongside Lavelle for the Washington Spirit from 2018 to 2020 was top of mind as someone who ""had an amazing season"" in the NWSL last year.

""It was amazing to see her get rewarded and get called up"" Lavelle added.

Hatch scored twice in two starts against the Matildas. And both times she found the back of the net in the first five minutes of play.

""I was really excited for Ashley Hatch"" Ertz said. ""She got a couple goals as well. To get your first start and also first score in the first minute is pretty cool. I'm sure that was a special moment for her.""

""She did really good and just came in and seamlessly fit in"" Lavelle added. ""Two starts and two goals is just even more icing on the cake.""

Lavelle also mentioned current OL Reign teammates Alana Cook and Sofia Huerta as players who performed well with the USWNT after stellar NWSL play. Foudy for her part liked the pairing of Cook and Tierna Davidson on the back line.

And both were impressed with Emily Fox the top pick in the 2020 NWSL Draft who Foudy deemed ""really good in that outside back position"" through 123 minutes in Australia.

""We got to see what she could do at the international level"" Lavelle added. ""She's so fast and aggressive on defense. Great 1-v-1. She was great.""

But no one made a stronger case for themself than Casey Murphy the 25-year-old goalkeeper who used what Lavelle called ""two unreal games"" to introduce herself as the national team's goalkeeper-in-waiting.

The North Carolina Courage star became the seventh netminder in USWNT history — the first since incumbent starter Alyssa Naeher — to record a clean sheet in her first cap. She added eight saves several of which were acrobatic and awe-inspiring to keep the national team out of trouble for the full 90 minutes and earn Budweiser Woman of the Match honors.

Andonovski stuck with Murphy for the second game of the two-part series. And once again Murphy did not disappoint. She and the USWNT's defensive unit held the Matildas scoreless through the first 87 minutes of regulation but an unlucky deflection in the final moments of regulation resulted in Murphy's first — and only to this point — goal against in her senior national team career.

""Casey had a tremendous trip"" Foudy said. ""Someone said to me on an ESPN hit I did: 'Does that create a goalkeeping controversy?' And I said 'I wouldn't call it a controversy. I'd call that a great problem to have.'""

""That's a healthy competitive position"" she added. ""When Naeher gets back from injury and [Adrianna] Franch is back I mean that's gonna be fun to watch.""

Goalkeeper is far from the only position where the competition will be fierce in the coming months. At nearly every spot on the field Andonovski has more worthy players than he can possibly keep.

""And you're still missing a whole crop of players in Trinity Rodman and Mal Pugh"" Foudy noted. ""Sam [Mewis] wasn't there. Julie Ertz isn't there. Crystal Dunn is pregnant. And we haven't even gotten to that veteran group — [depending on] how many are gonna stay or continue on — but Press Heath there's so many.""

Once again the USWNT has an embarrassment of riches. And once again there are some difficult choices to make.

In the next 18 months — and perhaps even sooner with World Cup qualifiers on the horizon — Andonovski will need to whittle down the field and select a core group for soccer's most prestigious competition. And while each player will warrant consideration on her own individual merits Andonovski's larger decision will be between two distinct paths.

On the one hand Andonovski could stick with the old guard that helped the US win back-to-back World Cups but showed some considerable vulnerabilities at last summer's Olympics. On the other he could opt for fresh faces who offer tons of upside but lack the experience that has proven so valuable in major international tournaments.

Even with two World Cup victories and a pair of Olympic gold medals under her belt Foudy isn't sure which route is best.

""It's gonna be interesting when they get 'em all back. There's some decisions for sure"" she said. ""But I mean even Becky Sauerbrunn said it's definitely a different and awesome energy with that younger group because there's a hunger in everything they're doing.""

""And it's not saying that the veteran group is complacent because you never could say that about any national team player. It's in our DNA"" Foudy added. ""But now suddenly [a call-up] means a lot more to the veteran players too.""

""It's a good motivator.""

There are few wrong decisions in a pool as strong as this one; while the USWNT's starting XI is widely regarded as the best on the planet its backups are considered a close second.

As the top team in FIFA's women's national team rankings the US is the favorite to hoist the World Cup in 2023 for the third consecutive time. And though that's unlikely to change regardless of which path Andonovski takes with his roster the rest of the world's national teams will happily take any opportunity to gain some ground."

The historical facade for what was once the largest record store in the world has vanished on the Sunset Strip. The bright yellow strip with the red Tower Records logo was painted over this past week to make way for a new retail store coming to the Sunset Strip at 8801 Sunset Boulevard. A For Lease sign currently hangs at its store front windows.

“Thanks to @colinhanks the TOWER RECORDS signage was recreated for his documentary on the legendary record store in 2015” posted Los Angeles Vintage historian Alison Martino on her social media platforms. “And it was wonderful while it lasted. As of today it has been painted over for a new SUPREME SHOE store location. I guess it’s true that ALL THINGS MUST PASS. 😢”

The space has stood empty for the most part and has hosted a series of promotional pop-up stores over the years since its closure in 2006. It has served as a backdrop for several movies and TV shows and its logo was also in the background of several impromptu concert performance such as the free concert by Elton John and Lady Gaga in 2016 which shut Sunset Boulevard down.

According to historians Russell Solomon opened the first Tower Records store in 1960 on Broadway in Sacramento California. However the Tower Records store wouldn’t arrived on The Sunset Strip until 1971.

Tower Records entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the first time in 2004. Heavy debt incurred during its aggressive expansion in the 1990s growing competition from mass discounters and Internet piracy were major factors. Mismanagement managerial incompetence and crippling restrictions from the first bankruptcy deal also contributed to Tower’s demise.

In February 2004 the debt was estimated to be between $80 million and $100 million and assets totaled just over $100 million. On August 20 2006 Tower Records filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in order to facilitate a purchase of the company prior to the holiday shopping season.

Preservationists lost a battle to declare the building a cultural resource with the West Hollywood City Council in 2013 however Gibson Guitar stepped in and signed a 15-year lease on the building on November 2014.

The most recent restoration of the building dating back to its former glory was this past summer for the filming of the up-and-coming Hulu TV min series Pam & Tommy which is currently being promoted heavily on the Sunset Strip. The entire building was revamped to resemble what the store would have looked like in 1994/95. It was a nostalgic flashback to when album cover art of the latest musical releases would grace the side of the building.

Regarded as an influential figure in both the square mile and politics for his time advising the former prime minister Gordon Brown on the historic bailout of the British banking system Baron Myners of Truro in the county of Cornwall died in the early hours of this morning.

His family confirmed in a statement that Myners had “passed away peacefully” at Chelsea & Westminster hospital in London.

Adopted from a Bath orphanage by a Cornish couple at the age of three he started as an inner city school teacher then became a financial journalist for the Daily Telegraph before moving into finance with the storied London investment bank NM Rothschild.

Myners was chairman of the Guardian Media Group (GMG) publisher of the Guardian and Observer newspapers between 2000 and 2008 when he stood down to take his ministerial post in Brown’s government as the global financial system was imploding.

The former prime minister led tributes to Myners describing him as a “tower of strength” during the crisis.

“My thoughts are with Paul’s family” said Brown. “After a successful career in finance [he] was persuaded in 2008 to enter public service and was a tower of strength helping nationalise key banks and producing a plan to overcome the global financial crisis. His charitable work in his native Cornwall will be long remembered.”

Barely 20 days into his role as City minister Myners was thrown into the deep end to help orchestrate Brown’s bank rescue which led to the taxpayer taking multibillion-pound stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group after its merger with HBOS.

Nick Macpherson the former permanent secretary to the Treasury said drafting in Myners had been an “inspired appointment” during the emergency. “He played a leading role in resolving the financial crisis. Brilliant. Mercurial. Irreverent. Full of commercial acumen. It was a privilege to know him.”

Carolyn McCall the ITV chief executive who ran GMG while Myners was chairman said he would be “greatly missed”.

“Paul was formidable with a brilliant brain an entrepreneurial spirit and a prodigious work ethic. He didn’t suffer fools at all was a tough taskmaster and had a wicked sense of humour. I loved working with him and learned so much when he chaired GMG.”

GMG chair Neil Berkett said: “We are saddened to hear of Paul Myners’ death. As chair he led Guardian Media Group successfully during a period of great change in our industry.”

Earlier in his career Myners had been chair and previously chief executive of the City fund manager Gartmore where he made his name in finance after growing the firm into a multibillion-pound investment house. Under his stewardship its funds grew from £1.2bn in 1985 to £75bn in 2001.

In 2000 he moved to positions as a non-executive director of several companies including the chairmanship of Marks & Spencer during a tense period when the high street stalwart faced down a potential bid from the retailer Philip Green.

Stuart Rose who Myners parachuted in as chief executive of M&S in 2004 to revitalise the ailing high street stalwart said he had lost his best friend.

“He was a rare breed. Without overdoing it how can I describe him? He really was a beacon in a sea of mediocrity” said the Conservative peer who is now the chairman of Asda.

“He stood out he was a man of immense wisdom. Intellectually very strong a self-made man who was humble and loyal to the core. In this world we’re surrounded by today in business and public life he had a massive moral compass. He knew instinctively what was right and wrong and stood up for the little man.”

Myners refused to open formal talks over a sale of M&S when approached by Green before the former Arcadia retail tycoon dropped his multibillion-pound bid for the company in 2004.

“He was irreverently funny. He could absolutely bring you to stitches but he could be ruthless as well” Rose said.

Myners was also influential in compiling a landmark government review into institutional investment and chaired the Low Pay Commission. He entered the House of Lords in 2008 after being made a life peer and remained on the Labour benches until 2014 when he became a crossbench peer. He was appointed chairman of the UK arm of the international public relations firm Edelman in 2015 a role he held until his death.

“There are few people who bring such depth of knowledge and experience from the top of both the private and public sector and Paul always did so with a strong social and moral conscience” said Ed Williams president of Edelman in Europe. “He also brought fun and laughter and was able to move effortlessly from plcs to pop culture. I wish to pay tribute to his amazing contribution to public life over many decades.”

Myners is survived by his five children and five grandchildren. In a statement the family said: “With great sadness we announce the loss of our beloved father Lord Paul Myners (1948-2022). He passed away peacefully in the early hours of this morning (Sunday) at Chelsea & Westminster hospital. He will be deeply missed and in our hearts forever.”"

While families play in Lake Michigan we continue to see new records set every summer for the hottest days in Chicago Illinois.

Communities around the Great Lakes in Wisconsin and Michigan are staring down the need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming years to repair coastal damage linked to climate change.

While climate change is often attributed to increased long-term temperature averages it also is linked with increased severity and unpredictable weather—including an increase in severe rainfall events across the Midwest. It is also one of the more visible effects of climate change. For example research shows that just 10 storms per year drive 70 to 90% of the nutrient runoff into Lake Erie.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY29uZHdhdmVtZWRpYS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvU0VNSUktd29ya3MtdG8tcHJvdGVjdC1lZHVjYXRlLWFuZC1lbXBvd2VyLU5hdGl2ZS1jb21tdW5pdGllcy5hc3B40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SEMII works to protect educate and empower Native American communities,South Eastern Michigan Indians Inc. (SEMII) is a non-profit Urban Indian Center in Macomb County providing human services for Native Americans and others eligible for services. Since 1975 we’ve worked to address employment training and education in our community.As a Native person I’m from the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians in what’s now Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. When treaties were made with my people we called ourselves Ojibwe but Europeans heard and recorded Chippewa. So in their treaty with my tribe we are legally identified as Chippewa when in reality we are Ojibwe one of the Three Fires encompassed by the Anishinaabe: Ojibwe Odawa and Bodwe’aadamiinh.Some of us myself included use terms such as Indian North American Indian and Native American interchangeably because of the culture we’ve grown up in and because different names have been used on our legal and sovereign tribal documents. But I think it’s our responsibility to teach others how to call us by our name.At SEMII I serve as executive director co-directing with my husband Chris Franklin. This nonprofit doesn’t require individuals to prove their Native American citizenship in order to receive certain services to be members or to volunteer. We actually broke away from our original organization years ago because we know it’s difficult for some to do this and we want to be a place of assistance and welcome. We do however require proof of tribal citizenship from our decision-making bodies. It's critical that Native people are the ones holding office and running our center.We do many things at SEMII some are funded and some not. Two separate grants through the State of Michigan help support our culturally-relevant work to prevent educate and reverse Type II diabetes in our community and to fight against commercial tobacco use especially among our veterans. We make a distinction between cigarettes a deadly product made by the commercial tobacco industry and loose tobacco. We are Native people and tobacco is a spiritual medicine to us as well as our right under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. We’ve done a tremendous amount of education with health departments and others to help people understand this difference.The amount of disease our people experience due to commercial tobacco is just overwhelming. In 2007 when we began this advocacy work 47 percent of American Indians in Michigan smoked. It’s now 42 percent or slightly lower. This significant drop is due to the work being done directly with the tribes.In our Native communities diabetes is also a runaway epidemic. In some it affects 80 to 90 percent of the population. We are working to reduce this. One of our greatest barriers to health is a lack of literacy in our communities. When we communicate with each other we sit in a circle. Much of the health education we’ve experienced from others has included very clinical terms stacks of paperwork and people talking down to us. We wanted to change that.We developed a program in partnership with two doctoral candidates from the University of Michigan that uses our Circle of Life to address all the ways diabetes affects human beings: mentally emotionally spiritually and physically. We help people recognize those effects and decide for themselves what healthy changes they can make. We also provide food plans and blood sugar monitors. My husband is an example of someone who had diabetes and reversed it. We know this is possible and I'm so thankful for the work this grant empowers us to do.COVID-19 has taken lives from our Native communities locally and across the state. When it broke we sent our staff home to work remotely or to apply for unemployment and stay in touch. My husband and I stayed at the office because we run a pantry here and knew food would be one of the first things to disappear. This program has always been about reducing hunger in the Native American community but we’ve never confined it to this. If people come here for help we help them and in 2020 we had people come from as far as Detroit for food assistance.I embrace our teachings that we are responsible for one another. While that has often been shown culturally in our work we’re looking for new ways to be inclusive of other communities who need extra help right now. We're just a small agency but everything we have if we can help people be healthy and ease their suffering that's our goal.All of our services have continued throughout the pandemic many through virtual meetings. Now that we’re back in person by appointment only it’s my job to make sure our people staff and elders coming here are safe. When we’re in the building we’re masked in small numbers.Going virtual has actually allowed us to work with people we wouldn't otherwise know. We’re talking with Native people across the state about services needed in our areas and shared concerns. Currently we’re addressing issues of lateral violence in our communities and bringing many different people to the table to help mediate this. Everything we do is being done differently now and our staff is finding solutions. We have to change and be like the water. If rocks are thrown into the water it knows how to flow around them and keep moving. That's what we have to do as human beings and as human services.Lately I’ve been in many difficult meetings triggered by the bodies of all those children found at residential facilities in Canada. This has been heartbreaking to me. Once they start looking they're going to find even more children in this country. I grew up here I’ve worked in other states and with tribes across Southeastern Michigan for close to 30 years. I haven’t come across one Native person either from Canada or the U.S. who doesn’t share this history an ancestor kidnapped as a child by Indian agents and put into a residential boarding school. The separation of families the experiences these children had this history has devastated our communities and made us sick in so many ways. My hope is that by ripping this wound open there will finally be an opportunity to heal. That's part of our commitment here.One reason for an agency like SEMII is because when our people can't pay their rent or utility bills the last place they want to ask for help is the government. We're here to act as a buffer to show them how to access services and to advocate on their behalf. As Native people we're the ones charged with helping to create a healthier future for our children and grandchildren.Euphemia Franklin is the executive director of South Eastern Michigan Indians Inc.

The annual contest is organized by the independent nongovernmental Arms Control Association.

Mr. Ebrard and the government were nominated for their lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers and distributors that takes a novel approach to combat illicit weapons trafficking from the United States into Mexico that is fueling violence and criminal activity.

The lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts federal district court alleges that several major firearms manufacturers and wholesalers “design market distribute and sell guns in ways they know routinely arm the drug cartels in Mexico” and that contributes to a decline of life expectancy in Mexico. It said the named companies sell about 340000 of an estimated half-million guns that illegally flow each year from “Massachusetts and other U.S. states to criminals south of the [U.S.-Mexico] border.”

“The Mexican Foreign Ministry’s lawsuit against the U.S. firearms companies represents an important new way to hold rogue actors accountable for their role in the violence caused by small arms trafficking across international borders” according to Daryl G. Kimball executive director of the Arms Control Association.

“The Arms Control Person(s) of the Year contest is a reminder of the diverse and creative ways that dedicated individuals and organizations from around the globe can contribute to meeting the difficult arms control challenges of today and the coming decades” he said.

This year eight individuals and groups were nominated by the Arms Control Association staff and board of directors. “All of the nominees demonstrated extraordinary leadership in raising awareness of and advancing effective arms control solutions for the threats posed by mass casualty weapons during the course of 2021” Kimball said.

The runners-up in this year’s contest were Sébastien Philippe an associate research scholar of the Princeton Program on Science and Global Security and French journalist Tomas Statius for their groundbreaking investigation that challenges the French government’s official public story of the health consequences of French atmospheric nuclear tests in the South Pacific. Their new findings suggest more than 100000 people in Polynesia may be eligible to claim compensation from France for harm caused by the tests which is about 10 times more than estimated by the existing French government.

Online voting was open from Dec. 8 2021 until Jan. 12 2022. A list of all of this year’s nominees is available at the Arms Control Association

Previous winners of the Arms Control Person(s) of the Year award are:

Ambassador Bonnie Jenkins and Women of Color Advancing Peace and Security for catalyzing support and action from leaders and practitioners in the national security and foreign policy communities to increase diversity into their ranks (2020);

Steam Deck: Dimensions

Image via Valve

The Steam Deck will be 298mm x 117mm x 49mm or 11.7 inches long and 4.6 inches tall and just under 2 inches thick. For comparison the standard Nintendo Switch is 173mm x 102mm x 14mm or 9.5 inches long 4 inches tall and 0.55 inches thick.

Meanwhile the Steam Deck will weigh in at approximately 669 grams or 1.47lbs just less than twice the weight of a Switch with the Joy-Con controllers attached (0.88 pounds).

Steam Deck: Screen resolution refresh rate

So no matter what version of the Switch you’re looking at the Steam Deck is bigger than a Switch. Valve appears to have put that space to use according to the blueprints on the official website. There’s a plethora of buttons two thumbsticks a D-pad and a trackpad on each side of the 7-inch IPS LCD screen.

Additionally the console comes with Right and Left analog triggers and bumpers as well as four more bindable buttons on the back (R4 R5 L4 L5). The Steam Deck comes with a 7-inch touchscreen display. It’s larger than the original Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite although the Switch OLED matches it in size.

The Switch OLED also has better color reproduction and contrast thanks to its OLED panel whereas the Steam Deck relies on an optically bonded IPS LED screen. It’s also running at a fairly standard 60Hz refresh rate and a native resolution of 1280×800 marginally more than the 1280×720 of the Nintendo Switch.

Steam Deck: CPU layout battery and Steam Dock

Screengrab via Steam Deck

While the Steam Deck will have a Switch-like dock for easy use with TVs Valve has confirmed the Steam Dock won’t be available at launch. The official page says “more information [is] coming soon” about the Dock including a release date and pricing.

Like the Nintendo Switch Valve has quoted the Steam Deck’s battery life at somewhere between two and eight hours depending on usage and gameplay. Anything that pushes the Deck’s 4-core/8 thread APU—which is powered by AMD’s Zen 2 design and its RDNA 2 graphics architecture—to its limit will use up the battery more quickly while less demanding indie titles will get you closer to six to eight hours use.

Valve has opted for a fairly standard port layout with the Deck. The top left and right of the console house shoulder and bumper buttons—much like the Switch—and there is a 3.5mm headphone port volume buttons and a power switch. Valve has also placed the USB-C charging port at the top making it easier to use the Deck while charging.

Steam Deck’s operating system

While the Steam Deck will officially ship with the Linux-based SteamOS dual booting Windows is officially supported. Valve also confirmed they’re working with Microsoft to get the Deck supported for Windows 11. “There’s nothing to indicate to us yet that there’ll be any issues with Windows 11” Greg Coomer one of the designers of the Steam Deck told PC Gamer in an interview.

With the support for external displays and traditional mouse and keyboard devices this means you could turn the Deck into a portable desktop-type PC—although it’s worth stressing that performance of games on the Deck under Windows is likely to be compromised due to the extra overhead that Windows adds.

Steam Deck’s storage

While the Steam Deck comes with different storage options it’s worth noting the vast difference in performance between the base model and everything else. The entry-level Deck only comes with 64GB of eMMC storage which is substantially slower than the 256GB and 512GB NVMe SSD-powered offerings that retail from $529 and $649 respectively.

However users do have the option to upgrade the storage further. The Steam Deck comes with a microSD slot that supports expandable storage. It’s worth noting that microSD cards are typically much slower than SSDs though—so if you want a microSD card with comparable speeds expect to pay $150 or more. That said if you’re happy playing older titles or mostly indie games where loading times are not a major factor then a slower SD card will do.

Where to buy the Steam Deck

If you live in one of the supported countries you can place a preorder for the Steam Deck through the official page. The first Steam Deck orders are expected to ship sometime in February with the console missing its original launch date because of COVID-induced shocks to the supply chain. For those living outside of the United States Canada United Kingdom and the European Union Valve says “information about expanded regional availability [is] coming soon”.

The Deck’s price ranges from $399 to 649 depending on storage options.

Apple will require unvaccinated employees — or those who haven’t yet submitted proof of vaccination — to provide negative COVID-19 rapid antigen tests before entering the workplace beginning on January 24th although it’s unclear whether this applies to both corporate and retail employees.

Starting Jan. 24 unvaccinated employees or those who haven't submitted proof of vaccination will need negative COVID-19 tests to enter Apple workplaces the report said. The Verge said it was not immediately clear if the testing requirement applies to both corporate and retail employees.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Many companies in the U.S. have been strengthening their COVID-19 rules mandating vaccination and delaying back-to-office plans as the Omicron variant increases infections across the country.

This week Facebook parent Meta Platforms mandated COVID-19 booster shots for all workers returning to offices. It also delayed U.S. office reopenings to March 28 from an earlier plan of Jan. 31.

Alphabet Inc's Google on Friday said it was temporarily mandating weekly COVID-19 tests for people entering its U.S. offices.

A report by The Information said Amazon.com Inc has offered its U.S. warehouse workers $40 to get a booster shot.

Apple said late Friday it’s releasing a pair of what it calls entitlements that will allow developers to implement their own third-party payment services to pay for dating apps in the Netherlands.

That will circumvent Apple’s 15% to 30% revenue share which has been highly scrutinized by governments and developers in multiple countries.

The iPhone maker said dating app developers can continue to use Apple’s system and outlined the benefits of doing so.

“Because Apple will not be directly aware of purchases made using alternative methods Apple will not be able to assist users with refunds purchase history subscription management and other issues encountered when purchasing digital goods and services through these alternative purchasing methods"" the company said in a message to developers posted on its website.

The company also said it disagrees with the decision and is appealing it.

“Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court"" Apple said. “We’re concerned these changes could compromise the user experience and create new threats to user privacy and data security.""

Apple said it will let developers of select apps point users to the web to complete transactions this year.

The company was ordered by the Dutch antitrust authority to allow dating apps to use other payment systems or face a fine of as much as 50 million euros ($57 million) with a Jan. 15 deadline to make the change.

Apple imposes “unreasonable conditions"" by not allowing a free choice for app payments besides Apple’s in-app purchases the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets said.

The Macintosh – the Apple Mac – launched two days later and brought personal computing to the masses.

Child’s play

IT was so easy to operate that a child could do it. “The big difference with the Mac was that a complete novice – indeed children – 10-year-olds five-year-olds who had never seen a computer before – seemed to instantly and intuitively lunge for the mouse” Dag Spicer senior curator at the Computer History Museum in Palo Alto California summed up.

Before the Mac computers were controlled in a language called DOS by obscure typed-in commands like “copy a:\autoexec.bat c:\windows” the letters clicking onscreen in white or green on a black background. The industry was largely controlled by IBM – “Big Blue” – with its $5000 IBM PC XT. At the cheap end there was the Commodore 64 gaming machine if batting a white square ball off a digital wall can be considered a game.

The 30-second launch ad was made by Ridley Scott (with a nod to Fritz Lang’s Metropolis) and the symbolism the subliminal message was that the athlete – 19-year-old Anya Major – represented Apple and Big Brother was the then-dominant IBM. But it nearly didn’t get shown. The Apple board was initially unwilling to fund the $800000 spot in the showpiece football game and the company’s co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had considered funding it themselves.

Wozniak put it this way: “They didn’t like Steve’s [Jobs] personality. Steve would have a vision and they would fight it – they would have a different vision of their own. They just got tired of Steve calling them idiots.”

Eventually the “idiots” backed down and the ad ran.

Scott the lot

RIDLEY Scott was then the most famous and expensive hired hand making commercials. He would later become a director of blockbuster films including Alien and Blade Runner but he learned his skills in advertising.

For the Apple shoot he demanded an actress capable of running up to a huge computer screen turning and throwing the hammer convincingly at the screen. Most of the actresses at the casting call in London’s Hyde Park couldn’t do it. Indeed one nearly felled a pedestrian with the hammer. But Major who was a discus thrower as well as a model won the role because she could.

The shoot on the outskirts of London took three days and the drones the grim marching men were local skinheads paid $25 a day.

They were trouble and on the third day they took to fighting and throwing rocks at each other which didn’t phase Scott. He had what he needed. Two days after the Super Bowl ad the Mac was launched by Jobs to a packed audience in the De Anza College auditorium in Cupertino still the home of Apple.

Looking at footage now it’s almost like a revivalist meeting with cheering crowds people frantically waving arms gasps and minutes of applause as the boxy computer is pulled out of a bag by Steve Jobs who powers it up.

After the swelling music and a few images on the screen a deep computer-generated voice comes in: “Hello I’m Macintosh. It sure is great to get out of that bag. Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking I’d like to share with you a maxim I thought of the first time I met an IBM mainframe: never trust a computer you can’t lift.”

The audience is frenziedly clapping and cheering. “Obviously I can talk but right now I’d like to sit back and listen. So it is with considerable pride that I introduce a man who’s been like a father to me ... Steve Jobs.”

Opening the Gates

IN the packed audience near the back of the hall Bill Gates and a gaggle of Microsoft employees are sitting. They have the message. A year later in 1985 Microsoft launches the first version of Windows having licensed some aspects of the interface from Apple.

Three years later with Windows soaring Jobs and Apple filed a lawsuit claiming that the look and feel of their software had been copied. The action failed and since then graphical interfaces pioneered by Apple have become the standard for computers in homes and offices around the world.

Jobs had brought in John Sculley from PepsiCo as chief executive and he was convinced to put around $80 million behind the launch of the Mac. It was a fateful mistake.

Tensions between him and Jobs were evident so much so that the man who with Wozniak had started the company in his parents’ garage joined the small team developing the revolutionary computer almost as a side project to the main business of the company which was then the more conventional machines.

Jobs wasn’t just a visionary about computers. He realised that software and particularly desktop publishing software would be crucial to success. Adobe’s PostScript Page Description Language which delivered a uniform computer publishing language and fonts came with the Mac.

A year after the hysterical launch in Cupertino in January 1985 Aldus’s Pagemaker debuted on the Mac along with Mac Publisher and Ready Set Go. Jobs’s engineers had also been working on a laser printer and just weeks later the LaserWriter was introduced. Apple had almost single-handedly created the desktop publishing market. The Mac became the favoured machine of graphics departments marketing divisions schools small businesses and book and newspaper publishers.

The cult of Jobs

STEVE Jobs’s relationship with Sculley was in meltdown however and in September 1985 he left having cashed in stock options of $21.43m. He set up his own computer company NeXT which was not the success he imagined. But he did hit the gold seam and become a billionaire by investing in the struggling George Lucas start-up Pixar Animation Studios which became stratospherically successful with the film Toy Story.

More than a decade later in December 1996 Jobs returned to the company he formed when he sold NeXT to Apple for $400m and after the worst quarter results in its history became first interim CEO and shortly after the permanent boss.

The UNIX-based operating system he developed at NeXT laid the groundwork for the OS X operating system which Apple continues to develop. The PowerBook the iMac the MacBook Air and clutch of computers followed and in 2007 the product which would take Apple to the top of the corporate ladder and become by far the richest company on the planet the iPhone. Jobs died of pancreatic cancer in 2011.

Without him and the talking 17lb computer with the nine-inch screen he pulled out of the sack onstage almost 40 years ago there would have been none of that."

A spokesperson said “The second year of the online course launches Monday evening January 17 with a roundtable discussion on international business featuring Marc Grandisson Chairman of ABIR and Chief Executive Officer of Arch Capital Group Ltd; the Hon. Curtis Dickinson JP MP the Bermuda Minister of Finance; and course facilitator Craig Simmons Bermudian economist and senior lecturer at Bermuda College.

“The 14-week series of classes is designed to give participants a foundational knowledge of the Bermuda’s re/insurance sector and to provide a stepping stone towards a career in the industry. Hosted via Zoom on Monday evenings starting at 6pm the sessions will feature presentations Bermuda re/insurance executives regulators from the Bermuda Monetary Authority and by St. John’s University faculty.”

John Huff Chief Executive Officer of ABIR said: “We are pleased to see strong interest in the course for the second successive year and would encourage any student or member of the public with an interest in Bermuda’s world-class re/insurance industry to register. ABIR member companies are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce. We are happy to partner again with Bermuda College and St. John’s University as we seek to attract future leaders to our industry.”

A spokesperson said “International business is the largest employer among the economic activity categories listed in the Bermuda Government’s Employment Briefs 2021 report with a total of 4240 full-time positions after four successive years of job growth in the sector. ABIR member companies are committed to the development of strong local workforce and provided educational scholarships with a value of more than $1.3 million in 2019 in addition to internships graduate training programmes tuition reimbursement and leadership training.”

Mr. Simmons said: “The executives who present on the course are dedicated and committed to enticing more Bermudians into the industry. One concrete indicator of this commitment is the number of internships on offer. Last year we had more internships than students. The gateway has never been this open. There is a global shortage of talent – and common sense says that you should tap into the local pool and nurture on-island talent. If you are thinking about a career in reinsurance then you might want to register.”

Mr. Simmons said: “Whilst the discussion will revolve around the economic impact of the re/insurance sector and international business more broadly we also want to touch on the social impact.”

A spokesperson added “Topics covered by subsequent sessions with ABIR member company C-Suite executives will include the evolution of Bermuda’s re/insurance industry and its economic importance; climate risk and Bermuda’s leading position of providing natural catastrophe reinsurance; the growing legacy run-off industry in Bermuda; life and annuities; collateralised reinsurance; captive reinsurance and Bermuda’s regulatory regime.

“Bermuda College students can enroll for the course and earn eligible credits. The lecture series is also open to members of the community who wish to learn more about Bermuda’s international re/insurance industry at no cost.

“To register for ‘Special Topics in Insurance: Foundations of Bermuda’s International Re/Insurance Sector’ visit the Bermuda College website at www.college.bm.”

A measure to be introduced in the Common Council calls for scheduled building inspections of all 144 local landmarks.

""The single most important change"" that preservationist Tim Tielman said he would like to see is a new name for the City Hall department that handles demolition requests. It should be called the Department of Permit Inspection and Community Preservation Services he said.

""The commissioner is getting advice on how to tear things down"" said Tielman executive director of the Campaign for Greater Buffalo History Architecture & Culture which filed a lawsuit to stop the Great Northern's demolition. ""He or she should be required to get advice on how to keep buildings standing.""

James Comerford the Buffalo commissioner of permits and inspections said he has taken steps to stave off demolition in past emergency situations. But Comerford said preservation concerns are not part of his decision-making process when an emergency arises.

""We don't provide the solutions"" said Comerford who approved an emergency demolition permit to Archer Daniels Midland to tear down the Great Northern. ""That's not my job. My responsibility is public safety.""

Gwen Howard president of the Buffalo Preservation Board and a certified New York State building code official and licensed architect said other remedies should have been considered to save the property while protecting the public including measures already employed on large masonry structures in the city.

""They could have removed the metal paneling put a net around the masonry or fenced the property"" Howard said.

Local landmarks are heavily promoted by the travel and tourism bureau and featured in films. They're among the first places residents take out-of-town friends and relatives to see. But not all are immune to emergency demolition permits.

""This is the only building of its type left in the world and our answer is demolition?"" developer Rocco Termini said of the Great Northern.

""If the Notre Dame Cathedral was in Buffalo it would have been torn down and there was no building more in danger of collapse than the Notre Dame Cathedral"" Termini said.

Following a pattern

The Great Northern is a textbook example preservationists say of how a local landmark allowed to become rundown turns into a crisis leading to a city-issued emergency demolition order.

The last remaining brick box-style grain elevator in North America was acquired by ADM in 1993 three years after the Common Council proclaimed it a local landmark. Despite the designation ADM which owns the adjoining flour mill sought its demolition three years later and again in 2003.

Engineering reports given to the city pinpointed problems the company thought were significant yet the city's Permits and Inspections Services Department never directed them to make repairs.

Until the windstorm the structure wasn't inspected or cited in 28 years.

""If they can write me up for my hedges or peeling paint why can't they write up one of the largest brick buildings on the earth?"" asked Howard.

The Great Northern – a hulking structure at 250 Ganson St. and visible from the Skyway – shows signs of deterioration with missing gutters and downspouts and water infiltration on the west wall.

Comerford said there wasn't a reason for it to be inspected.

""We never had one complaint on that building"" he said. ""If preservationists saw something they should have reported it to us.""

It's not known if the Great Northern's derelict condition contributed to the hole in the north wall from a Dec. 11 windstorm. But the scenario that played out afterward has become all-too-common in Buffalo.

Comerford issued an emergency demolition order to demolish the cavernous Great Northern without first considering preservation alternatives.

Preservationists then mobilized in a desperate last-minute attempt to save the structure.

That this continues to happen in 2022 is a sad state of affairs said Ed Healy vice president of marketing at Visit Buffalo Niagara.

""The fact we are still having to fight these battles over such an important piece of our industrial heritage is really painful to contemplate"" Healy said.

""I had hoped that after the National Preservation Conference in Buffalo in 2011 which was such a tremendous success there would have been a greater respect a greater regard and a greater understanding of what it means to have such a unique identity"" he said.

""Sometimes I think people from elsewhere appreciate what we have more than we do"" he said.

Nearly lost

Shea's Buffalo Theatre. The Darwin Martin House. The Guaranty Building. The Richardson Olmsted Complex. SUNY Erie's City Campus.

They and other structures were saved from the wrecking ball by preservationists.

The Richardson which reopened with the Hotel Henry in 2017 ""was a metaphor for Buffalo's own rebirth"" said Healy who noted national and even international press heralded the reopening.

""These are all things that have generated tremendous interest in Buffalo and millions and millions of dollars in positive publicity that have helped change our image in the greater world"" Healy said.

But many other buildings have not been spared in the past 20 years: the Harbor Inn St. Mary's on the Hill Scottish Rite Cathedral and the H-O Oats and Wheeler grain elevators among them.

Mayor Byron Brown in December 2019 promised he would be ""unyielding"" toward commercial property owners after a Civil War-era building suffered a second structural collapse and an emergency demolition was ordered.

""I am telling everyone right now it will be a tough tough plan that will put all kinds of pressure on problem property owners"" the mayor said at the time.

But to preservationists Brown's refusal to force ADM to make repairs to the Great Northern suggests little has changed.

Tielman said Comerford told him last month outside court that ""you've been a worthy adversary."" Tielman said there's something wrong with City Hall's culture when preservationists are seen that way.

Delaware Council Member Joel Feroleto plans to introduce legislation on Jan. 25 that would require each of the 144 local landmarks to be inspected every three years an average of 48 inspections per year. He decided to introduce the measure after learning that the Great Northern was not inspected for so many years.

""We hear the term 'demolition by neglect' and no landmark should ever be demolished by neglect"" Feroleto said. ""This will ensure that if a landmark is being neglected an inspector could write it up and begin the process of requiring repairs.

""When this law goes into effect we will have a building inspector at properties every three years so there will never be an instance where a local landmark will go decades without going inspected.""

Brown said he could support such a schedule if more resources were provided.

""All of this work requires bodies and resources and the resources of the city are always stretched very thin"" Brown said. ""There is a cost and someone is going to have to pay for that.""

Jessie Fisher Preservation Buffalo Niagara's executive director said the city doesn't have to wait for legislation to make the process better. She said section 337 of the city charter and the Buffalo Housing Court Act of 1974 give the city authority to protect local landmarks and the building stock in general.

""What we really need is a commitment from this administration that they want to start utilizing the powers they already have"" Fisher said.

Howard said she believes the mayor recognizes the value that historic architecture brings to the city and she hopes the city and the preservation community can learn from the Great Northern situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Actor Lucien Laviscount the most recent addition to the “Emily in Paris” cast and Evan Mock of “Gossip Girl” fame turned up to support the Italian brand both dutifully excited.

More from WWD

Laviscount who donned Fendi’s single-breasted Klein blue suit and matching logo-ed fluid shirt said it was his first time in Milan.

Talking about “Emily in Paris” the hit Netflix series that made a splash since it debuted in 2020 attracting viewers who couldn’t get enough of the characters’ style and over-the-top storyline he was clearly upbeat about the recently announced renewal for seasons three and four a few weeks after the much-anticipated second season aired.

Laviscount plays Alfie an English banker in Emily’s French class who soon becomes her love interest in a triangle with the blue-eyed chef Gabriel interpreted by Lucas Bravo.

“I am so happy for the guys they deserve everything Lily is like a wonderful human being to work with so they deserve it” the British Laviscount said referring to co-star Lily Collins.

He was mum about other upcoming projects and finding his way to his seat said he was looking forward to “something new and fresh” to be paraded on the catwalk. “I am ready to see what the world’s going to be wearing for the rest of the year.”

A few seats away Mock shared some tidbits on what to expect from season two of “Gossip Girl” HBO Max’s recent reboot of the CW original series of the same name which is set nine years after the original website went dark.

“I can’t really talk about it but there’s so much going on that you guys are going to be sick of it by the end of it” said Mock a Fendi favorite who’s attended the brand’s shows in the past.

He dodged questions on the evolution of the triangle love affair of his character Aki Menzies with Max Wolfe and Audrey Hope played by Thomas Doherty and Emily Alyn Lind respectively but confirmed it will definitely go on in season two. No release date has been set.

Oscar-nominated director and fashion darling Luca Guadagnino was also mum about his most talked about upcoming project Apple’s Audrey Hepburn biopic with Rooney Mara set to play the “Breakfast at Tiffany‘s” iconic actress. The filmmaker is busy putting the final touches on “Bones and All” a romance-horror movie based on the book of the same name by American novelist Camille DeAngelis. It stars Mark Rylance Taylor Russell and Timothée Chalamet reuniting the director with the young Hollywood sensation and main character of “Call Me By Your Name.”

Some 100000 ‘land parcels’ were issued on Pavia each being minted as a unique non-fungible token (NFT) with individual ‘coordinates.’ Over 60% of these parcels were pre-sold in October and November 2021 with the remaining set to go on sale in the first quarter of 2022.

NFTs are blockchain-based representations of tangible or intangible objects. Metaverses generally describe a virtual world in which people can interact as they do in the real world but digitally.

Pavia’s native token functions as an in-game currency 25% of which was airdropped to NFT landholders following a blockchain snapshot in December 2021. Data from Muesliswap a Cardano-based exchange show pavia tokens sell for just over 20 cents at the time of writing and have a market capitalization of over $107 million.

Data shows there are now over 8300 plot owners on Pavia. However users cannot deploy assets over their plots as of Monday. “Please remember at this stage in development you cannot visit or deploy any content onto your land parcel” documents from Pavia caution.

Euphoria’s second episode picks up where episode one left off: at the New Year’s Eve house party where Fez attempts to follow through on his threat against Nate namely by killing him. He doesn’t. Nate is carried to a car by several people as Rue’s narration begins.

Each Euphoria episode tends to favor a single character with Rue acting as third-party narrator. Episode 1 featured Fez whose adolescence Rue chronicles from criminal witness to criminal. Episode 2 though it begins with Nate will make several character jumps accessing multiple people’s thoughts and activities. In other words: it was a wild episode.

How Rue is able to make these moves has always been suspect. Several times this episode she reminds us she wasn’t there—or sober—to know exactly what happened. She tells us anyway. At this point nothing Rue says should be taken without a pinch of powder. Her unreliability has been proven several times over as we often see things that don’t actually occur or jive with her telling of them. (Her and Jules’ matching tattoos for example.)

This unreliability allows the series to dial up full bombast. Maybe these events are happening. Maybe they are stylistic hyperbole. Maybe the entire show is a lie Rue tells to a group of addicts in an AA meeting. Who knows.

What’s important for episode 2 however are things we learn about Nate’s post-assault state: he inexplicably loves Cassie now.

The rest of the episode proceeds from there.

Here’s what happened in episode 2.

After the Party

Photo credit: HBO

According to Rue Nate begins falling for Cassie as he is transported to the hospital. He imagines a life with her including her bearing his child. He also imagines his father dying which frees him from most of his current woes—including the fact that Maddy still has a recording of Daddy Jacobs hooking up with Jules an object which seems to have become Nate’s grail quest.

Next we return to school where Rue and Jules mack in the hallway Rue narrating explaining she finally has everything she always wished for. Then Elliot shows up Rue gets weird (she’s been hanging with Elliot and doing drugs even though Jules thinks she’s sober) and Jules leaves upset.

Meanwhile Cassie becomes increasingly awkward around Maddy her best friend. (Remember she hooked up with Nate at the NYE party.) Cassie decides she wants to be single even though she has never really been single and like totally does not want to be single. Maddy later tells Cassie that Nate texted. Cassie is jealous. Cassie doesn’t want to be single.

Maddy tells her this while babysitting from a house somewhere in the California hills. Turns out Maddy is trusted around children—also super rich children. We learn she mostly babysits so she can try on all of the mother’s clothes in their walk-in closet. When the parents return Maddy almost gets caught. Instead the mother asks Maddy to help her unzip her dress and the camera lingers just a bit too long leading us to think there might be some weird stuff about to happen between Maddy and this mom.

Back at the School

Photo credit: HBO

The girls are in the bathroom where Kat is asked about her sex life with Ethan. Through Rue we learn that Kat thinks Ethan is sweet but there’s something upsetting her. We see a recreation of Kat and Ethan making out. Ethan leaves to go to the bathroom. In the bathroom Ethan is impaled by a Dothraki warrior who then enters the bedroom to “conquer” Kat. They have sex. Kat tells the girls in the bathroom it was Ethan doing the conquering. Clearly it was not.

Pause. A couple things here. Obviously this is Kat’s fantasy—and one symbolically substituting rough Game of Thrones sex (really rape) for what is likely an impotence issue in her relationship with Ethan. Euphoria has been committed to showing male genitalia on screen perhaps as a criticism of its own medium—a premium cable TV company that has gratuitously shown female genitalia for decades. The fantasy is a dig on Game of Thrones which was criticized for its dramatized sex. Here in Kat’s bedroom however it is the man who is under our gaze not Kat. Okay critical theory discussion over.

Meanwhile Cassie is freaking out because she thinks Maddy will find out about her and Nate—and kill her. Jules is freaking out because of Elliot. And then Cassie and Lexi are freaking out because Daddy Jacobs is in their living room asking them who beat up Nate. Cassie tells him. Lexi is pissed.

We learn here that Lexi struggles with doing what she knows to be right. We see her threaten Rue to tell her mother about her drug usage—a bluff that Rue calls. Later we see Lexi woken up by her mother who tells her Rue has overdosed (likely the season 1 finale). Lexi blames herself. This time wanting to warn Fez Lexi decides to see him in his convenient store. Outside we see Daddy Jacobs reach for a gun.

Sometime that Night

Photo credit: HBO

Meanwhile Nate is driving around with Cassie trying to break up with her but being typically predatory about it. He takes her to a construction site where they hook up (after he chases her like a gentleman). Maddy calls both Nate and Cassie but the calls aren’t answered. She looks suspicious.

During all this Elliot and Rue smoke up. Elliot asks Rue if he brings out the worst in her a question Jules’ father simultaneous asks Jules about Rue. (They’re supposed to be hanging. Instead she’s with Elliot.) Later Elliot’s mother asks about Rue insinuating that Elliot doesn’t often have girls over.

Rue then heads to an AA meeting where she meets Ali who notes that Rue is still on her suicide mission.

During all this Kat is having another crisis about Ethan. She realizes it’s probably her fault for not loving him. (We see her sitting in her room having an argument with several hallucinated models who tell her just to love herself—an obvious critique of self-love messaging. The problem is Kat can’t love herself. She’s fucking depressed.) Instead of seeing Ethan by herself she invites him bowling with Maddy and Jules. Maddy later tells Jules she wants to get back together with Nate even though he’s terrible for her.

Back to the Convenient Store

Photo credit: HBO





Lexi stops in to see Fez but before she can talk to him Daddy Jacobs shows up. He gives Fez a dramatic warning and then leaves. He never draws his gun.

Ali later drives Rue home introducing himself to her mother. Rue is nervous Ali will tell her mother that she started using again. Ali does not.

In the final scene Daddy Jacobs confronts Nate who reveals he knows all about the Jules sex tape. When Daddy Jacobs ask if Nate has it he just stares off into the show credits.

• À lire aussi: Les champions en grande forme

La formation californienne l’a emporté en s’assurant d’avoir le ballon le plus longtemps possible. Elle a été en attaque durant huit minutes et huit secondes de plus que ses rivaux du jour.

Le jeu au sol des Niners a été un facteur clé de ce gain. Au total ce sont 169 verges et deux touchés qui ont été amassés par des courses. Elijah Mitchell et Deebo Samuel ont été ceux qui ont franchi la ligne des buts avec le ballon en main. Ils ont respectivement amassé 96 et 72 verges sur leur course.

Les Cowboys se sont toutefois approchés à une possession des Niners au quatrième quart gracieuseté d’une très vilaine interception lancée par Jimmy Garoppolo. Bénéficiant d’une position avantageuse le quart-arrière Dak Prescott a inscrit un touché avec ses jambes.

La défensive des 49ers a toutefois accompli le boulot quand l’équipe texane a obtenu le ballon deux fois dans les derniers moments du quatrième quart.

Les Cowboys se sont également tirés dans le pied en gérant mal le cadran dans les dernières secondes du match. L’indiscipline leur a coûté très cher aussi car ils ont écopé d’un total de 14 pénalités pour 89 verges.

La victoire n’a pas été sans conséquence néfaste pour les Niners parce que l’excellent chasseur de quarts-arrière Nick Bosa s’est blessé pendant la première demie et qu'il n’est pas revenu au jeu par la suite. Sa formation a indiqué qu’il a subi une blessure à la tête.

La semaine prochaine le club de San Francisco visitera les Packers de Green Bay. L’équipe d’Aaron Rodgers a bénéficié d’un laissez-passer pour le premier tour éliminatoire après avoir terminé la saison régulière au premier échelon du classement de l’Association nationale.

L'Union européenne va aussi prendre des sanctions a annoncé le chef de la diplomatie française Jean-Yves Le Drian.



Sanctions en cascade pour le Mali. Air France a annoncé mercredi 12 janvier la suspension de ses liaisons avec le Mali ""avec effet immédiat"" dans la foulée de Paris – qui a emboîté le pas de la Communauté économique des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (Cédéao) – pour sanctionner la junte.



""En application des décisions des autorités françaises Air France suspend ses vols de et vers le Mali avec effet immédiat et jusqu'à nouvel ordre"" a indiqué la compagnie française à l'AFP. ""En conséquence le vol AF4142 du 12 janvier assurant la liaison Paris (CDG)-Bamako (BKO)-Nouakchott (NKC)-Paris (CDG) et le vol AF4141 Bamako (BKO)-Paris (CDG) sont annulés"" selon la même source.



En outre ""les vols de et vers Bamako programmés les jours suivants seront également annulés. Air France suit la situation en temps réel et tiendra ses clients informés des possibilités de réacheminement une fois la suspension levée"" a ajouté la compagnie en soulignant que ""les clients concernés [étaient] informés individuellement"".



La Cédéao a décrété dimanche la fermeture des frontières avec le Mali et un embargo commercial et financier sanctionnant durement le projet de la junte de continuer à diriger le pays pendant plusieurs années.



La France et les États-Unis importants partenaires du Mali ont pris le sillage de la Cédéao. Le président Emmanuel Macron a assuré que la France et l'Union européenne dont son pays assure la présidence tournante soutenaient la ""position très claire et ferme"" de la Cédéao face aux ""dérives de la junte"".



""La situation au Mali et au Sahel est une affaire africaine et européenne""

Sous impulsion française l'UE va prendre des sanctions contre le Mali a assuré mercredi à l'AFP le ministre français des Affaires étrangères Jean-Yves Le Drian.



""Nous allons proposer de soutenir les décisions africaines de les reprendre pour une partie d'entre elles"" a déclaré le chef de la diplomatie française dans un entretien à l'AFP. ""Nous allons en débattre à Brest demain (jeudi)"" lors d'une réunion informelle des ministres européens de la Défense et des Affaires étrangères ""mais l'hypothèse la plus vraisemblable est que cela sera suivi"" a-t-il assuré.



La Cédéao a sanctionné durement le projet de la junte de continuer à diriger le pays pendant plusieurs années au lieu d'organiser comme promis le 27 février des élections présidentielle et législatives. En retour la junte a appelé mardi les Maliens à manifester vendredi contre ces sanctions tout en se disant ouverte au dialogue.



""La situation au Mali et au Sahel est une affaire africaine et européenne ce n'est plus une affaire franco-malienne"" a fait valoir Jean-Yves Le Drian en référence à la participation de 10 pays européens au groupement de forces spéciales Takuba déployé au Mali à l'initiative de la France.



Le président Emmanuel Macron avait affirmé mardi que la France et l'UE soutenaient les ""sanctions inédites"" prises dimanche par les dirigeants ouest-africains contre la junte au pouvoir au Mali et avait entrouvert la voie à des sanctions européennes.



""La junte essaie de duper l'ensemble de ses partenaires""

Outre les dirigeants ouest-africains et les Européens le voisin algérien a également encouragé les militaires maliens à ""une attitude responsable et constructive"". ""L'Algérie prend une position modérée de facilitateur nous le notons avec intérêt"" a réagi Jean-Yves Le Drian qui a par ailleurs rappelé la réunion ""dans les prochaines semaines"" de la soixantaine de membres de la Coalition pour le Sahel ""pour prendre une position collective"".



""La junte essaie de duper l'ensemble de ses partenaires. Il y a une fuite en avant un appel confirmé à une milice extérieure (des mercenaires russes de la société paramilitaire Wagner NDLR) et le calendrier de transition est tout à fait inacceptable"" a insisté le chef de la diplomatie française. ""C'est maintenant à la junte de prendre ses responsabilités. Sinon elle prend le risque de voir ce pays être asphyxié.""



La France dont des milliers de militaires se battent contre les jihadistes au Sahel a cherché en vain à dissuader Bamako de faire appel aux services du groupe russe Wagner. De plus en plus nombreux des instructeurs russes ont été déployés ces dernières semaines notamment à Tombouctou selon des responsables militaires maliens.



Au terme de près de neuf ans de présence la France a entrepris en juin de réorganiser son dispositif militaire en quittant ses trois bases les plus au nord du Mali (Tessalit Kidal et Tombouctou) pour se recentrer autour de Gao et Ménaka aux confins du Niger et du Burkina Faso. Ce plan prévoit une réduction des effectifs de 5 000 actuellement à 2 500 - 3 000 d'ici 2023.



Interrogé sur la capacité de l'armée française à poursuivre son activité au Mali dans ce contexte tendu et incertain Jean-Yves Le Drian a botté en touche : ""C'est au Mali de prendre les mesures nécessaires pour que la transition puisse se faire dans les plus brefs délais et que nous puissions continuer ensemble à combattre le terrorisme"".

Par Oumy LY (Correspondante) – Après avoir fait un mandat de 7 ans à la tête de la municipalité de Diourbel le maire sortant Malick Fall a affirmé qu’un seul mandat ne suffit pas pour terminer toutes les réalisations entamées tout en invitant les populations de Diourbel à voter pour lui parce que selon lui son successeur pourrait bloquer ses chantiers en cours. D’autant plus dit-il qu’un ministre ne peut pas être un maire alors que lui il est un édile résident. M. Fall a indiqué : «Nous avons bénéficié dans le cadre du Promovilles de 11800 km avec des assainissements et de l’éclairage public. On est en train de construire un hôtel pour 2 milliards 300 millions de F Cfa pour l’hébergement des touristes lors des grands évènements religieux comme le grand Magal de Touba. Nous avons fait 20 km de raccordement en eau pour les villages périphériques et plus de 50 km dans le cadre de l’électrification. Ce sont des infrastructures réalisées en partenariat avec l’Etat.»

Investi sous la bannière de la Coalition Wallu Senegaal M. Fall a promis de densifier des raccordements en électricité notamment dans les villages périphériques de Ngouye et Mbakane. En 2022 poursuit-il «je prévois d’injecter 150 millions dans le domaine de l’hydraulique et d’entamer le projet de construction de routes en partenariat avec le Fera (Fonds d’entretien routier autonome). Dix bacs à ordures seront mis dans les quartiers». A l’en croire ils ont signé une convention d’1 milliard 200 millions de F Cfa avec le Fera pour la réalisation de 285 km de routes dans toute la ville dans les deux prochains mois. Il a aussi fait savoir qu’il a l’ambition de construire un stade municipal à Ndiodione pour un montant de 300 million de F Cfa ; en précisant que l’argent est disponible. «Je veux réaliser une zone artisanale bien aménagée avec toutes les commodités à la sortie de la ville en allant vers Kaolack pour un montant de 250 millions de F Cfa afin de recaser les mécaniciens et autres artisans de la ville. Nous envisageons la construction d’un nouveau poste de santé pour 100 millions F Cfa ainsi qu’un nouveau foirail dont les travaux seront lancés dans 3 mois.» Toutefois Malick Fall a annoncé l’inauguration d’un nouvel état-civil informatisé avant d’ajouter que sa campagne sera axée sur des visites de proximité et inaugurations de 25 projets réalisés pour une valeur de 200 millions de F Cfa.

But the store’s management says the whole thing was a stich-up.

Ignacio’s Tailor shop on East 60th Street issued a groveling apology and told The Post an unwitting employee who didn’t understand what the symbol meant accepted the white shirt with a swastika armband for dry cleaning.

When managers were alerted to the garment they called the cops and then tossed it.

“For me I feel like it’s a hate situation. It’s the first time we had this situation… they want to hurt the business” Jorge Hernandez a manager at Ignacio’s said.

City Councilwoman Julie Menin posted a picture of the evil symbol Monday morning that was taken by a horrified customer at Ignacio’s Tailor shop on East 60th Street.

A friend of the customer forwarded the snap to the UES lawmaker.

“A constituent in my district alerted me to the fact that a tailor on the UES has this hanging in his queue to be tailored. I have reached out to this business and they will not be tailoring this item and@NYPDnews is currently investigating” Menin said.

Menin later told The Post she only posted the picture after workers at Ignacio’s confirmed with her office that it indeed had a shirt with the Nazi symbol which was held with two pins onto a white dress shirt.

“They confirmed they would not dry clean the item. It’s a hate symbol. The police were notified and were at the store” she said.

The snap quickly went viral on social media sparking horror and condemnation.

A second photo later circulated of the customer’s ticket with a name and phone number with a Russia area code — but no date for pick-up.

Jewish activist Lizzy Savetsky blasted the store for accepting the order to dry clean a swastika.

Her husband’s grandmother survived Auschwitz.

“Her parents were both murdered” Savetsky who reposted the photo of the Nazi clothing on Instagram.

“The tailor allegedly knew what the symbol was and took the job anyway” Savetsky claimed in the post.

Savetsky later said in an interview that she wasn’t “letting the store off the hook.”

“It’s Holocaust Remembrance Day. This is a black and white issue. Good vs. evil” she said.

“This is the most evil symbol of all time — it equates to the genocide of my people!” Savetsky 38 a mother of three kids who resides near the tailor shop said.

But some customers think the shop may have been duped by a sick prank.

In business for 20 years the tailor boasts a client list posted up at the entrance that includes luxury designers Armani Chanel Ralph Lauren Christian Dior Versace Porsche Gucci Tom Ford and among others.

Hernandez said a customer took a photo of the swastika before it was brought to his attention which then exploded on social media.

The manager said he was out for lunch when a couple believed to be one of the customers — a black man with braids and a white woman in their 30s — came to drop off the swastika outfit.

He later tried calling the number on the ticket but couldn’t reach the person so he called the NYPD Saturday afternoon.

“I say ‘what is this?’ I have to do [my job]. It’s very disgusting very bad. It’s a very bad thing that happened.”

The shop is already being bombarded with one-star reviews citing the swastika and Hernandez said he’s also getting angry phone calls.

But one longtime customer — a granddaughter of Holocaust survivors who visited the store — said the tailor was a victim and not complicit what what appeared to be a hateful stunt.

“It’s upsetting” the woman said of the swastika incident. “It’s so horrible.”

“I think somebody planted it on purpose… I think it’s a message. We’re seeing it everywhere. It is so hurtful.”

She referenced Larry David’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” episode where Larry opts to dry-clean a Ku Klux Klansman’s robe after he accidentally spills coffee on it.

The dry cleaner accepts the robe and then throws it away before Larry collects it.

“Think that that had anything to do with it?” she said only half in jest. “Think about it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21hbi10YWNrbGVkLWRhdmUtY2hhcHBlbGxlLWhvbGx5d29vZC0xOTA0MjQyODguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man who tackled Dave Chappelle at Hollywood Bowl files lawsuit against venue,"Dave Chappelle was attacked onstage at the Hollywood Bowl in May 2022. His attacker is now suing the venue but not the comic. (Evan Agostini / Invision / Associated Press)

The man who tackled comedian Dave Chappelle onstage two years ago has sued the Hollywood Bowl and its security team alleging negligent security and battery.

Isaiah Lee who pleaded no contest to charges relating to the 2022 incident and was sentenced to jail because of it alleged in a civil lawsuit that security guards employed at the venue for the ""Dave Chappelle and Friends"" event pulled Lee off of Chappelle and began beating him ruthlessly spitting on him and dislocating his arm intentionally.

In a complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday — exactly two years after the incident — the 25-year-old who identifies as bisexual and has experienced homelessness said he tackled Chappelle after ""The Dreamer"" star ""unleashed a barrage of homophobic and transphobic jokes"" and joked about homelessness during the inaugural Netflix Is a Joke comedy festival. The complaint obtained Monday by The Times said Lee ""became upset by the discriminatory nature of the comedian's jokes and rushed the stage in protest as the show ended.""

""Instead of intervening to protect Lee [the defendants] allowed members of the comedian's entourage encouraged by the comedian to beat Lee"" the lawsuit said. The complaint also said that a knife fell out of Lee's pocket well after the altercation was underway and that its presence ""did not justify the force"" used against him.

Jonathan D. Evans Lee's attorney argued that the Hollywood Bowl and the unidentified ""Doe"" security companies were aware of Chappelle's history of making offensive jokes that target the LGBTQ+ community as well as his ""propensity for making discriminatory remarks"" but ""took no measures to prevent or mitigate the potential harm caused by such offensive material."" The firebrand comic who is not listed as a defendant in Lee's lawsuit made headlines for months ahead of the incident because of jokes he made in his 2021 Netflix special ""The Closer"" which resulted in an employee walkout for the streaming giant and broad criticism of Chappelle's work.

""We cannot comment on ongoing legal matters"" a spokesperson for the Hollywood Bowl said Monday in a statement to The Times. ""However the safety and security of our audience and artists are of the utmost importance to the Hollywood Bowl. Security procedures are updated regularly to provide the safest possible environment for those who attend and perform at the Bowl.”

A spokesperson for Chappelle did not immediately respond Monday to The Times' request for comment.

Any company the Bowl might contract with for security could not be contacted for comment due to lack of identification.

Lee's attack occurred only months after Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock on live television at the 94th Academy Awards and violence reaching onstage was one of many issues concerning live performers at the time.

According to previous reporting Lee emerged from the Bowl audience on May 3 2022 and appeared to lower his head and charge Chappelle knocking the Emmy-winning actor backward. Lee then fled to the back of the stage where he was apprehended by security and sustained minor injuries. Chappelle who was not hurt later made quips about Lee and the incident and how the events played out.

Lee pleaded no contest to one charge of misdemeanor battery and one charge of entering a restricted area during a live event and was sentenced in December 2022 to nearly nine months in county jail. He completed his sentence and is currently in a transitional living facility his attorney confirmed Monday to The Times.

In the lawsuit Evans argued that the security company employed by the Bowl ""had a duty to exercise due care"" in the performance of its security services and failed to reasonably perform them resulting in the injuries suffered by Lee.

Instead of detaining or arresting Lee using a reasonable amount of force or intervening to protect him from the beating the security company ""allowed members of the comedian's entourage encouraged by the comedian to beat Lee senselessly"" the complaint said. Employees of the security company ""joined in the beating"" and ""took no action to prevent it the assault"" the document said.

""As a direct and proximate result of the above-mentioned conduct of and omissions by Defendants ... [Lee] was placed in great fear for his physical well being and has suffered and continues to suffer extreme mental and physical pain suffering anguish fright nervousness anxiety grief shock humiliation indignity embarrassment and apprehension all to his damage in a sum to be determined at trial"" the complaint said.

The filing also said that Lee ""was placed in great fear for his physical well being suffered and continues to suffer extreme mental and physical pain anxiety humiliation and apprehension among other issues. He has since experienced a significant loss of enjoyment of life and his injuries required immediate surgery it said and he cannot fully use his shoulder or engage in certain physical activities that he regularly did before the incident.

Lee is seeking a judgment against the defendants in a jury trial as well an unspecified amount in damages coverage of his medical and related expenses legal fees and further relief the suit said.

""He’s not after a set dollar amount. He just wants the security company or whoever else was beating him twisting his arm out of socket and spitting on him to answer for going overboard"" Evans said Monday in an email to The Times. ""He should have been detained and taken into custody. That’s it. What the security guards did to him and allowed others to do him goes beyond the scope of what’s acceptable.""

(1:09)

Open Extended Reactions

CINCINNATI -- Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marked a major offseason milestone on Monday.

As the team started the second phase of voluntary workouts Burrow was in uniform and throwing a pass in a video shared by the team.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday. But quarterbacks coach Brad Kragthorpe told the team's website he was pleased with how Burrow looked in his first practice back since suffering a season-ending wrist surgery last November.

""He looked like the Joe Burrow we're used to seeing"" Kragthorpe said. ""I didn't see any difference. I thought the ball came out of his hand well. Confidently. I'm happy where he's at.""

HE IS SO BACK. pic.twitter.com/ZsZjzkZEmg — Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) May 6 2024

On Nov. 27 Dr. Thomas Graham repaired the scapholunate ligament in Burrow's right wrist a source confirmed to ESPN following an initial report by the Cincinnati Enquirer. In March Burrow told ESPN that he expected to be fully cleared following his surgery. He noted that the timetable for his return if he remained on track was no different than other offseasons.

""In a normal offseason I wouldn't be throwing until OTAs really anyway"" Burrow said. ""I can lift basically normal now which I'm excited about.""

Burrow missed the final seven games of last season after he suffered the wrist injury in a Week 11 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. It capped an injury-riddled year that started with a strained right calf that he suffered during the first week of training camp in 2023 and re-aggravated in Week 2.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday as they started Phase 2 of their offseason program. During this three-week period coaches are allowed to work with players on the field and teams are allowed to run plays at a walk-through pace under certain conditions.

Why didn’t I know I could get breast cancer at 23?”

If she hadn’t known that she could have breast cancer so young there was a very good chance others were equally uninformed she said in a 2021 interview with The Guardian. She spent the next 15 years educating young people about early detection through her nonprofit organization CoppaFeel and in a 2021 memoir “Glittering a Turd.”

On Monday CoppaFeel announced that Ms. Hallenga had died at 38. A spokesman for the organization said she had died at home in Cornwall England and that the cause was breast cancer.

“Survival was never enough” she said during a publicity tour in 2021. “I don’t just want to survive I want to be able to really look at my life and go ‘I’m glad to still be here and I’m getting the most of what I want from life.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvamFtZXMtZ3Vubi1zaGFyZXMtZmlyc3QtbG9vay1hdC1kYXZpZC1jb3JlbnN3ZXRzLXN1cGVybWFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Gunn Shares First Look at David Corenswet's Superman,"DC Studios co-CEO and Superman director James Gunn has shared the first full look at David Corenswet as the Man of Steel.

Revealed on Threads Gunn told fans to ""get ready"" for the July 11 2025 premiere date while fully revealing Corenswet's Superman. The image shows him sitting in what's presumably a Metropolis skyscraper very casually pulling up his boot while an earth shattering event takes places outside.

While this is a fresh new Superman from a fresh new DC Universe the suit itself doesn't appear particularly new as the sacred S symbol and its arms appear dirtied or faded. Though we'd already been shown the logo the new image reveals the rest of the suit and gives fans plenty more to analyze as they try to figure out Gunn's influences ahead of the film's release.

Superman previously Superman: Legacy will be the first film in the rebooted DCU's Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters but it's definitely not an origin story and also features a ton of other DC heroes and villains.

Alongside Corenswet's Superman stands Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane and the film also stars Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho María Gabriela as The Engineer and more. Gunn confirmed these actors will play the roles in other DCU projects too.

Chapter 1 of the DCU also features TV shows and while the exact contents have shuffled a tad since Gunn and co-CEO Peter Safran announced it in 2023 an animated series called Creature Commandos will officially kick off the new universe in late 2024.

In the last decade neural network-based solutions have become extremely popular. At the same time deep learning is quite a complex field requiring high theoretical knowledge from experts. The industry needs quite a lot of these specialists but now there are not enough of them to satisfy the request. With this gap between supply and demand special tools are emerging. Let’s call these tools “automated tools”.

Such tools are appearing in other industries as well. For example special machines allow automating car assembling and irrigation systems allow automating agriculture. As a result of the technology fewer specialists are needed to assemble cars and irrigation.

The same processes are observed in modern “Data Science”. Various Automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks and libraries appear. All of them allow us to automate the process of model identification. For classical machine learning tasks (classification regression) on tabular data the H2O TPOT AutoGluon LightAutoML or FEDOT frameworks might be used. Such libraries are called AutoML frameworks. However the field of identification of deep learning models has been taken up by technologies of a slightly different nature. The so-called Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is commonly used here.

Generally speaking all NAS algorithms belong to the AutoML category. However there is a significant difference in approaches because of the specifics of neural networks. Firstly neural networks tend to have much more hyperparameters than classical machine learning algorithms (imagine ResNet and a linear regression model for example and compare them). Secondly neural networks usually require much more resources for computation. This is a big problem which limits the set of algorithms for optimization which can be used for neural networks.

Disclaimer: AutoML and NAS are great! More and more routine things are being done with software leaving more time for experts to conduct interesting experiments. I am involved in the development of the AutoML tool and believe that such instruments are the next step in the evolution of Data Science.

Neural Architecture Search

A neural network is a complex model. It consists of a large number of components (hyperparameters). An expert needs to determine the topology of the neural network how many layers how many neurons what activation functions batch size and more before starting training the model. It is worth remembering that a neural network requires a lot of resources to train. So it is too complicated to fully enumerate all these hyperparameters using grid search.

Algorithms instead of an expert can choose a model. Such algorithms are for example libraries AutoKeras NNI ENAS in PyTorch and others. Some approaches allow quickly implementing such optimizers yourself for simple architectures. For example based on the optuna optimization library — examples. On the other hand there are also intriguing academic frameworks that look for an optimal neural network based on evolutionary algorithms — nas-fedot and NAS-object-recognition (the development of these modules is handled by colleagues from our lab :)).

The topic is really popular so there are many tools I have listed here a very small part of them. But if you are interested in the topic you can start with them. Many more solutions exist in the form of concepts for example in scientific papers in journals and conference proceedings. Use the keywords “neural architecture search” to search and you will find many articles (I promise) (Figure 1).

Another approach?

There was cited a small part of all the developments that are taking place in the field of NAS. And yes I want to introduce another one. The motivation for this is the assumption: I believe that increasing the number of neurons and layers is a reliable way to increase the accuracy of the algorithm. But at the same time it noticeably increases the “computational cost” of training the neural network as well as the size of the model. In this case the search space becomes too large to find something really optimal also. Perhaps if we limit to given neural network topology and optimize the activation functions and other hyperparameters (without changing the number of layers and neurons) it will work just as well.

So let’s try to make an algorithm that optimizes some hyperparameters of the neural network. The number of neurons and the number of layers do not change during the optimization. This makes it possible to reduce the search space.

“The most important thing is the logo”

Honestly it’s quite important. At least for me. The algorithm and the concept are nice but the experience of developing the product is important also. And the experience consists of exterior attributes such as the design of the repository documentation and related materials.

Figure 2. The logo for the module that is being developed (image by author)

Actually the concept is more important than the logo

But the concept is vital too. So let’s explore the core idea of the algorithm.

The first specific feature I encountered before starting to implement an algorithm is the high computational cost of NAS algorithms. Indeed to train several neural networks for a fairly large number of epochs is time-consuming. So it was decided to train just one neural network but to change some hyperparameters during training. At certain moments a small number of neural networks with alternative configurations of hyperparameters are generated. To determine how successful the proposed changes have been it is suggested to use the increase in the metric over several epochs (Figure 3).

Figure 3. The main idea of the optimization algorithm (image by author)

The main hyperparameters are m — number of epochs for initial and final training pop_size — the number of generated neural networks with alternative hyperparameter configurations n — the number of epochs devoted to the training of each “alternative neural network” k — number of epochs for fixing training of the intermediate neural network after crossover or selection c — number of cycles with population generation and changes. As can be seen from the names of the hyperparameters terms from the field of evolutionary computation are used: the set of alternative neural networks is called a population the procedure for evaluating the effectiveness of models is called a fitness evaluation. A change in hyperparameters — a mutation. However the proposed approach is not truly evolutionary (although it is quite similar to it).

The optimization process is shown in the animation below. For convenience each intermediate neural network is serialized in a zip archive. If necessary it is possible to specify the flag so that the folder with serialized models is deleted after the end of the computation.

Animation. Neural network optimization (animation by author)

As can be seen from the animation a single neural network with an initial configuration of hyperparameters is trained first. Then several alternative models are generated in each of which the hyperparameter is replaced. The current prototype is capable of making the following changes:

Change optimization algorithm (SGD Adam Adadelta etc);

Change activation function in a randomly selected layer;

Change the batch size;

Not much but even with this approach the search space is quite large.

The most successful replacement is selected based on fitness evaluation:

The value of the fitness function depends on the absolute value of the last received value of the loss function for a neural network;

The value of the fitness function depends on the rate of learning (how fast the loss function changes from epoch to epoch).

The most successful model is trained over several epochs. And then the cycle with replacement is repeated.

Technical details

The module is based on three main parts: optimizer (model) evolutionary operators (evolutionary) and logging system (Figure 4).

Figure 4. The main ways of interaction between the different parts (classes and methods) of the program (image by author)

I found it especially valuable to implement a logging system. In the process of optimization a lot of important information is stored (Figure 5).

Figure 5. An example of a metadata file that stores information about the optimization process (image by author)

In addition to the information the models are also stored. It is worth noting that they are all already trained and represent ready-to-use models. To make it easier to understand the names of the files the following picture is prepared (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Archive names with serialized neural networks (image by author)

As it was written earlier all these models are saved in a folder. If it is required that only the final model remains after all the calculations it can be specified that the folder is deleted after the experiment. Thus based on the experiment with running the model the following learning history can be obtained:

Figure 7. Example of one of the test launches of the algorithm (image by author)

Experiments

To find out how effective the algorithm is it was decided to conduct several experiments on different tasks for different neural network architectures:

Applications of the algorithm for Feedforward neural network (FNN) optimization. Task — multi-class classification of the MNIST dataset and comparison with the Optuna framework (see example);

Applications of the algorithm for Convolutional neural network (CNN) optimization. Task — gap-filling in remote sensing products (The effectiveness of the algorithm is compared with init neural network training without hyperparameters search).

About classification task — MNIST_optuna_miha.ipynb

In this jupyter notebook a comparison was made with Optuna in terms of accuracy metrics. The optuna optimizer increases the number of layers in the neural network while MIHA only changes the activation functions batch size and optimization algorithm. The following metrics were obtained from the results of the experiments on the test sample: MIHA — 0.974 Optuna — 0.976 (the results are almost the same).

About gap-filling task.

Quality metric — mean squared error (MSE). The MSE for the neural network with the initial configuration of hyperparameters was 0.38. For the same number of epochs the neural network with a sequential change of hyperparameters using MIHA algorithm obtained MSE 0.13.

Conclusion

Thus we have looked at the neural network structure optimization field of machine learning. I have tried to share my developments in this area and hope you have found it engaging. It is worth adding that the described algorithm is not a complete library at the moment. MVP is capable of working on a limited number of tasks and is used to demonstrate the concept.

See you later!

The recently concluded International Conference on 4th Industrial Revolution and Beyond [IC4IR] organised by the University Grants Commission divulged issues and imperatives on technological evolution and its human interface.

It is interesting to see the sequence and duration of each successive Industrial Revolution and the trend in technology adoption through appropriate educational requirements to tide with the changing environment. It took about 100 years for the transition from the mechanization of production using steam engines in 1780 to the invention of electricity in 1870 helping division of labour and mass production. The third Industrial Revolution commenced in 1970 paving the way for mass production with the integration of Programmable Logistic Controller [PLC] in car manufacturing. The primary reason for designing such a device was to eliminate the large cost involved in replacing the complicated relay-based machine control systems. The 1980s saw an attempt to standardize communications with General Motor’s manufacturing automation protocol (MAP). It was also a time for reducing the size of the PLC and making their software programmable through symbolic programming on personal computers instead of dedicated programming terminals. Thus PLC witnessed phase-wise improvement till 1990. During the next twenty years technological evolution witnessed phenomenal growth.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution [4IR] includes nanotechnology biotechnology and advanced digital production [ADP] technologies. The latter includes 3D printing human-machine interfaces the internet of things [IoT] and artificial intelligence [AI]. The ultimate protocol is the convergence and complementarity of emerging technology domains. “It is uniquely marked by a blurring of the boundaries between the biological the physical and the digital realms.”

Technological innovation stripped many favorite products from our regular use for instance Video Cassette Recorder and surprisingly jobs now performed by a smartphone could not be performed by a mainframe computer in the late seventies. Simple photocopy machine was a luxury in many developing countries during the sixties students and teachers in those days relied on the Facit machine to perform numerical calculations and clinical devices were rudimentary. Strangely medical diagnostics and AI are now incorporated in mobile technology for contact tracing and data collection technologies. Current digital tools have shown promising results in managing infectious outbreaks. Thus the above review of IR by phases shows a distinct time frame in transition but beyond Fourth IR the fleeting technological evolution may obfuscate such a fine distinction.

Thus the continuously evolving technology poses challenges in adoption and may be tamed only through requisite skill and knowledge in succession. Currently the penetration of 4IR is confined to just four developed economies that hold 77 per cent of ADP-related patents worldwide. UNIDO’s Industrial Report 2020 drew a bleak picture on 4IR adoption in developing countries. However the “globalized nature of value chains manifests that most parts of the world will be impacted by 4IR sooner or later directly or indirectly positively or negatively.” Indeed the availability and affordability of ADP (Automatic Data Processing) technologies with the right level of and combination of skills and industrial capabilities is the sine qua non in this swift transition.

Therefore the academic infrastructure needs to be dovetailed to meet such challenges through restructuring and reengineering; otherwise the skill and knowledge gap in the process may endanger the existence of even a dynamic community and state. Fortunately; Covid-19 in disguise taught us a lesson regarding the resilience of internet protocol in our day-to-day activities spanning from academic to financial and business worlds.

It would be interesting to see how Bangladesh weathers such turbulence with her modest level of preparedness. As a matter of fact many experts believe that Bangladesh’s level of preparedness may not be enough to face future challenges in the technological domain if we do not emphasize restructuring education to meet the burgeoning skill gap between the current level of preparedness in skill and craft and the skill requirement in the spontaneous innovation in technology. “There is clearly a virtuous circle at play: the more technology-and digitally-intensive industries exist in an economy the faster the diffusion of ADP technologies and the greater the build-up of experience and expertise which in turn accelerates the process of further digitalisation.”

IC4IR was an eye-opener on Bangladesh's preparedness to face technological innovation in the future. The collaborative drive between industry-academia collaboration translated through the Mujib 100 Industrial Exhibition and Mujib 100 idea contest synchronized the modalities of interface for grooming human capital through Innovative Education Ecosystem [IEE]. It is encouraging to note that future continuous collaboration may usher in a national platform under the guidance of UGC for sustainability and efficiency. The outcome-based education with components such as internship industry-based projects and attachment with units could help university students for their skill development. A periodic review of the academic curriculum may provide a sense of direction on the redundancy of topics and the urgency of incorporating new modules in the course curriculum.

Textbook-based education is designed to understand the structure of input-output embedded in technology and helps in the thinking process but attachment provides the real flavour of such theoretical understanding. Unfortunately the university curriculum in many instances is based on classical ideas and seldom revised to incorporate topical issues. The book that catalogues Mujib 100 Idea Contest is full of gems and demonstrates an excellent understanding of the young entrepreneurs and professionals in this man-machine interface drill. Moreover the abstract of over 100 papers spanning from tariff-improving Access to Sustainable Electricity to implementation of a Digital Healthcare Service Model for Ensuring Preventive and Primary Healthcare in Rural Bangladesh corroborates depth in understanding and designing a pragmatic and economic solution on many issues pertaining to digital technology.

A grim reality of the 4 IR is the changing nature of jobs that the youth within the next two decades will encounter. The World Economic Forum [WEF] in a report predicted that 65 per cent of the children entering primary school today will ultimately end up working in completely new jobs that don't yet exist. It would be quite an interesting exercise to envisage the nature of jobs in the next ten years.

Try these Fixes,"Android Auto disconnecting issue is one of the most annoying issues a car user may encounter. The issue is reported on a USB connection (mainly after a car bump) as well as on a wireless connection with nearly all makes/models of the phones/vehicles. The problem usually starts to after an OS or Android-Auto update. Once the disconnection occurs a user either has to relaunch Android Auto re-plug the USB cable or restart the phone/car to reconnect but in a moving vehicle in heavy traffic it becomes troublesome.

Android Auto may keep connecting and disconnecting due to numerous factors but the following can be regarded as main:

Outdated Android Auto App Phone’s OS Google Play Services or the Unit’s Firmware : Android Auto may keep disconnecting if the Android Auto app phone’s OS Google Play Services or unit’s firmware are outdated as it can create incompatibility with the others.

: Android Auto may keep disconnecting if the Android Auto app phone’s OS Google Play Services or unit’s firmware are outdated as it can create incompatibility with the others. Corrupt Cache Data or Installation of the Android Auto App : If the cache data or installation of the Android Auto app has become corrupt due to a recent update then you may encounter frequent Android Auto disconnection.

: If the cache data or installation of the Android Auto app has become corrupt due to a recent update then you may encounter frequent Android Auto disconnection. Battery Optimization of the Android Auto : If the Battery Optimization feature of the phone is killing an essential process related to the Android Auto then Android Auto may fail to keep the connection.

: If the Battery Optimization feature of the phone is killing an essential process related to the Android Auto then Android Auto may fail to keep the connection. Improper Configuration of the USB Debugging or Developer Options: USB Debugging and Developer Options control many of the connection settings of a phone and if any of these are in a misconfigured state then the Android Auto may show the connection issue at hand.

Update the Android Auto App to the Latest Build

The Android Auto app may keep disconnecting from the car’s entertainment unit if the app itself is outdated as it may have become incompatible with the car unit. In this context updating the Android Auto app to the latest build may resolve the frequent disconnection issues.

Launch the Google Play Store on the phone and open its Menu. Now select My Apps & Games and head to the Installed tab. Then scroll down and open Android Auto. Now tap on the Update button (if an update is available) and once updated restart your phone. Upon restart check if the Android Auto disconnection issue is resolved.

Clear Cache and Data of the Android Auto App

The disconnecting issue of the Android Auto app could be a result of the corrupt cache and data of the Android Auto app. Here clearing the cache and data of the Android Auto app may solve the disconnection issue.

Launch the phone’s Settings and select Application Manager (or Apps/Applications). Now open the Android Auto app and tap on the Force Stop button. Then confirm to stop the Android Auto app and open Storage. Now tap on the Clear Cache button and check if the Android Auto issue is resolved. If not once again clear the cache of the Android Auto and then tap on the Clear Data button. Now confirm to delete the data of the Android Auto app and afterward check if the Android Audio disconnecting issue is resolved. If that did not work check if clearing the cache and data of the following applications solve the problem: Google Play Store Google Play Music Google Maps

Clean the USB Ports or Try Another USB Cable

Android Auto might fail to keep the connection alive if the USB cable gets disconnected from the phone or car. This can occur especially if there is lint or debris in any of the USB ports (phone car or USB cable) and the USB jacks cannot be fully inserted into the USB ports. Also if a non-stock phone cable is used to connect the phone and car then it can also cause the issue. Here cleaning the USB ports of the devices/cables or trying another USB cable may solve the problem.

Find a pointy object (like a needle toothpick folded piece of paper etc.) and gently clean the USB contact pins of the devices/cable but make sure not to damage the contacts. Then reconnect the devices and check if the Android Auto is working fine. If not check if using the phone’s stock cable to connect the devices solves the problem. If that did not work check if using a special high speed or data rate USB 3.1 cable (like an Anker cable) clears out the connection issue.

If the issue persists and is occurring when the car bumps check if placing the phone on something soft (like a cushion) to absorb the bump’s shock reduces the disconnections.

Update the Google Play Services to the Latest Build

Google Play Services is one of the core applications of the Android OS and if it is outdated then it can impact the complete operation of the phone including Android Auto. In this context you can fix the Android Auto connection by updating the Google Play Services to the latest build.

Update the Google Play Services to the latest build and once done restart your phone. Upon restart launch Android Auto and check if the disconnection issue is resolved.

If that did not work and the issue is occurring at a specific time/place check if the electromagnetic interference from other cars/devices is not causing the issue there.

Disable Wireless Projection of the Android Auto

If the Wireless Projection is enabled in the Android Auto’s Settings and a user’s phone is connected to the car device with a USB cable then this setting may affect the Android Auto’s ability to properly utilize the USB connection and thus cause the issue. In such a case disabling the Wireless Projection in the Android Auto’s settings may solve the problem.

Open the Android Auto’s Settings and disable Wireless Projection by toggling its switch to the off position. Now launch the Android Auto and check if its disconnection issue with the car unit is cleared.

Update the Phone’s OS to the Latest Build

The incompatibility between the outdated OS of the phone with the latest firmware version of the car’s entertainment unit may lead to the frequent disconnections of the Android Auto and updating the phone’s OS to the latest build may solve the problem.

Launch the Phone’s Settings and select System. Then select About Phone and open Software Update. Now tap on Check for Updates and if an update of the OS is available install the update. Once installed restart the phone and upon restart check if the Android Auto keeps disconnecting issue is resolved.

Enable Do Not Disturb Mode of the Phone When Using Android Auto

The Android Auto disconnecting issue could be caused by a phone’s notification that conflicts with the Android Auto modules. In this case enabling the Do Not Disturb mode of the phone may solve the problem.

Swipe down (or up) on the phone’s screen to expand the Quick Settings menu and then tap on Do Not Disturb. Now check if the Android Auto is working fine. If so then you may try to find the application’s notification causing the issue and streamline the issue between the app and Android Autio.

Disable the Auto Rotate Feature of the Phone

The auto-rotate feature helps to rotate the screen when the phone’s orientation is changed but the Android Auto app is not good at handling a sudden change in the phone’s orientation (either by a person or a car’s bump) that may cause the issue at hand. In such a scenario disabling the auto-rotate feature of the phone may solve the problem.

Open the Quick Settings menu of the phone (either by swiping down or up on the phone’s screen) and tap on Auto Rotate to disable it (if enabled). Now launch the Android Auto app and check if it is operating fine.

Correct Date/Time on the Phone and Car’s Entertainment Unit

Android Auto may keep disconnecting from the car’s unit if there is a date/time conflict between the devices and correcting the same may solve the problem.

Launch the phone’s Settings and open Date & Time (in the System section). Now disable Automatic Date & Time and Automatic Time Zone by toggling the respective switches to the off position. Then set the correct date and time on the phone. Now launch the car unit’s settings (e.g. Kenwood KDC 138) and find the clock adjustment option. Now adjust the car unit’s date/time as per the make/model instructions and afterward check if the Android Auto is clear of the disconnecting issue.

If the issue persists make sure the problematic phone is enabled in the car unit’s system settings and check if that resolves the issue.

Disable Battery Optimization of the Android Auto

If the battery optimization feature of the phone is killing the Android Auto modules during the process to extend the mobile’s battery then Android Auto may show the disconnection issue at hand. In this scenario disabling the battery optimization of the Android Auto in the phone’s settings may solve the problem.

Launch the phone’s Settings and open the Battery. Now select Battery Optimization and set Android Auto to Do not Optimize. Then launch the Android Auto and check if its disconnecting issue is cleared. If not then check if disabling the Battery Optimization for the Google Play Services solve the problem.

Keep in mind some phone models (like LG V10) may also show the Game Optimizer option if so make sure to exempt the Android Auto in there as well. Some phone models (like Galaxy Note 10+) may have an option of the App Power Management if so make sure to exempt the Android Auto to not put to sleep by the OS.

Disable Wi-Fi Switching of the Phone

If the user’s phone is configured to use the Wi-Fi switching (to switch to the best Wi-Fi available or switch to mobile data if the Wi-Fi signals are weak) then the Android Auto may get disconnected from the car’s unit as it gets stuck in fetching data from the servers due to the Wi-Fi switching. In such a scenario disabling the Wi-Fi switching of the user’s phone may solve the problem.

Open the phone’s Settings and select Wi-Fi. Now select Wi-Fi Preferences and disable Intelligently Select the Best Wi-Fi. Then check if the disconnecting issue of the Android Auto is cleared. If not disable the option of Switch to Mobile Data When Wi-Fi Internet Connection is Slow in the Wi-Fi Preferences and check if that resolves the Android Auto issue under discussion.

Update the Firmware of the Car’s Entertainment Unit to the Latest Build

The Android Auto may keep disconnecting from the car’s entertainment unit if the unit’s firmware is outdated as it can cause compatibility issues with the phone’s OS and Android Auto. In such a case updating the firmware of the car’s entertainment unit to the latest build may solve the problem.

Download the firmware from the car’s unit from the OEM’s website (like Kenwood) and extract it (if zipped). Now copy the extracted file to a USB drive. Make sure the USB does not have any other data. Then make sure the car’s entertainment unit is powered off and connect the USB to the unit. Now power on the entertainment unit and when it asks to update tap on Yes. Then wait till the unit’s firmware is updated. Make sure the entertainment unit does not power off during the process or the USB gets disconnected. Once done restart the unit and connect it to the Android Auto to check if its disconnecting problem is solved.

Enable USB Debugging on the Phone and Edit the Relevant Settings in the Phone’s Developer Options

If a USB cable is being used to connect the phone with the car’s stereo or head-up unit then enabling the USB debugging on the phone may solve the problem as it sets the USB modules as per the Android Auto cable requirements.

Firstly enable the Developer Options on the phone and then launch the phone’s Settings. Now select Developer Options and tap on the toggle of USB Debugging. Then confirm to enable the USB Debugging and afterward check if the Android Auto’s disconnection issue is resolved.

Set Networking Options to Default USB Configuration

Open the Developer Options of the phone and scroll to the Networking Options. Now select Default USB Configuration and enable Transfer Files (or PTP/Transferring Images). Then launch the Android Auto and check if it is functioning normally. If not check if setting the Default USB Configuration to Charging Only solves the problem.

If that did not work check if connecting the USB hub to the car’s unit and then connecting the phone to that hub resolves the Android Auto issue.

Enable Stay Awake in the Developer Options

Launch the phone’s Settings and open Developer Options. Now enable the option of Stay Awake and check if the Android Auto is operating normally.

Reinstall the Android Auto App

The Android Auto keeps disconnecting issue could be a result of the corrupt installation of the Android Auto app and reinstalling it may solve the problem.

Launch the phone’s settings and open its Application Manager (or Apps/Applications). Now select Android Auto and tap on Uninstall button. Then confirm to uninstall the Android Auto App and once done restart your phone. Upon restart reinstall the Android Auto app and check if the disconnecting problem is cleared.

Uninstall or Disable the Conflicting App on the Phone

If an app on the phone conflicts with the Android Auto app then it may result in the disconnection issue of the Android Auto. In such a case uninstalling the conflicting app may solve the problem. The Spotify app is reported by the users to cause the Android Auto issue at hand.

Launch the phone’s Settings and open Spotify. Now tap on Disable and then Confirm to disable the Spotify app. Some users may have to uninstall the Spotify app. Then launch the Android Auto app and check if its disconnection issue with the car unit is resolved. If not check if not increasing the car’s volume when the Android Auto is in use clear out the error.

If the issue persists check if deleting the phone from the car’s unit switching off the car deleting the car’s device in the phone’s/Android Auto settings clearing the cache/data of the Android Auto app and then reconnecting the phone to the car solves the problem.

If that did not work then check if using Pandora while Android Auto is functioning clears out the problem. If you are using a wireless charger then do note that the Android Auto along with Google Maps (especially when satellite images are enabled) GPS or other related apps drain a lot of battery from the phone and the wireless charger may not fulfill the requirements and using a USB cable charger may solve the problem. If none of the above did the trick check if using Bluetooth to connect the devices solves the problem. Check if trying another phone solves the problem.",,,,,,

The sneaky sting of inflation is catching many Americans by surprise as soaring prices erode their savings and prompt major sticker shock at the supermarket gas pump and seemingly everywhere they look.

Rapidly rising prices have become a major new wellspring of anxiety for American families. Some 3 in 10 Americans said everyday bills (15%) or inflation specifically (14%) was the single biggest concern facing their family right now according to a Monmouth University poll released last month. This is nearly double the 16% of Americans naming rising prices or household bills as their biggest concern last July and more than triple the 8% who named household bills as their top concern in August 2020.

Government data indicates consumer prices last month jumped at their fastest pace since 1982 -- the tail-end of an agonizing period in the U.S. economy when out-of-control inflation forced policymakers to orchestrate a steep correction that resulted in a recession and double-digit unemployment rates.

Many who remember this painful historical era are now retiring and research reveals that peoples' expectations about inflation are mostly shaped by their experience of it. This results in a ""substantial disagreement between young and old individuals in periods of highly volatile inflation"" economists at the University of California Berkeley and the University of Chicago wrote in a 2014 paper. It also suggests a majority of consumers are now unsure of how to navigate inflation or may be less aware of its broader dangers.

Here is how experts say inflation is eroding Americans' cash and how they can brace themselves for what might come next as policymakers seek to anchor in the surging prices.

Savings dissolving as those with no cushion get crushed by so-called 'cruelest tax'

Inflation defined by the Federal Reserve as increases in the overall prices of goods and services over time means that Americans are going to have to pay more money than they are used to for their essentials and other expenses.

While the ascending price tags can be a more obvious sting rising inflation can also impact the value of savings accounts for those who have been able to practice financial prudence in building up a rainy day or retirement fund.

Many Americans were able to save over the course of the pandemic thanks to fiscal support and the fact that COVID-19 shuttered businesses and urged people to stay at home rather than spend on the services they used to go out for according to Wells Fargo Senior Economist Sarah House.

""But that financial cushion is getting whittled away more quickly. Given these elevated rates of inflation that savings isn't stretching as far"" House told ABC News.

Chester Spatt a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University and former chief economist and director of the SEC's Office of Economic Analysis added that rising inflation suggests that Americans' ""spending power potentially is going to decrease quite substantially.""

If inflation is rising at a clip of 7% and your savings account offers interest rates of some 0.5% (or even an enviable higher-yield 1% rate) then ""that spending power might decline by about 6%"" Spatt told ABC News.

This means for those with $1000 saved up their financial buffer might actually be closer to $940 as inflation at its current pace eats into that money. For those with $10000 saved up they might expect to see about $600 seemingly evaporate from that nest egg -- without even touching it.

For Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck the impacts of inflation can be even more devastating. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned lawmakers on Tuesday that high inflation takes a toll ""particularly for those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials"" such as food housing and transportation.

""People sometimes talk about inflation being kind of 'the cruelest tax' that really hurts poor people disproportionately and I can see that certainly to be the case"" Spatt told ABC News.

Ultimately the historically high inflation we are seeing now is becoming impossible for consumers to ignore House added.

""When you're seeing roughly 2% price increases it's kind of running in the background that 2% number is by design"" House said of the past. ""But when we are seeing 5 6 7% inflation it's hard for consumers not to notice and that begins to affect how they think about their decisions including what they're asking for in terms of wages out of a job.""

Asking for higher wages is generally a good thing but during times of inflation those who were working during the 1970s and '80s know it can also be linked to further skyrocketing prices -- and at the broader level throw a wrench into efforts to rid inflation from the economy as a whole.

Policies to combat inflation have historically carried painful consequences

Inflation historically has been extremely difficult to eradicate and past efforts to do so by the government and policymakers have sometimes been accompanied by painful consequences.

At the same time the inflation we are seeing now is being fueled by vastly different circumstances than in the past specifically supply-demand imbalances spurred by a global pandemic and the fiscal and monetary policies that buoyed the economy during the unprecedented health crisis.

As supply chains recover from pandemic shocks and reach of pandemic-era stimulus policies wanes many remain hopeful that this will help ease inflationary pressures.

Economists also note that policymakers now have the lessons from the past to glean how best to respond to inflation.

During ""The Great Inflation"" period of the 1970s and early 1980s the most-recent inflationary period that those on the cusp of retirement are warning their children about inflation snowballed out of control as prices climbed and workers in turn asked for higher wages -- creating the economic phenomenon now referred to as the ""wage-price spiral.""

Wages are again increasing at headline-making rates as major companies -- especially in the service industry -- report struggles to attract and retain staff.

""We are in a tight labor market"" House told ABC News meaning workers are ""able to flex some of that clout a little bit more and extract some more wage increases"" from their employers.

""We're seeing this filter into inflation expectations to some extent; we're also seeing it filter into wages and so I think that'll be key in the year ahead as to how much inflation comes down"" House said. ""We are expecting it to recede given the unwinding of some of these pandemic distortions -- but I think now that we're seeing more pressure coming from wages in the labor market it's going to be harder to cool off.""

As a result House said she expects the Fed ""to step in a little more aggressively"" than they may have initially planned to help anchor inflation.

This will likely manifest in interest rate hikes which the Fed has already signaled will likely occur three times in 2022 and a more rapid end to pandemic-era monetary policies that flushed financial markets with liquidity.

These actions can help cool off inflation and uncertainty House said because ""it will send a signal to markets to consumers to businesses that they are on top of that that they are watching inflation numbers and they do not want to let this get out of hand or at least further out of hand.""

""That signal will help anchor inflation expectation and that can have an influence on further price setting whether that's for goods services or for labor"" she added.

Looking back at history the Fed was seen as initially behind the curve and slow to raise interest rates in the '70s to respond to inflation -- before announcing a shockingly sudden federal funds rate increase of almost 20% in 1980. Those who held bonds directly or through retirement accounts subsequently suffered huge losses and real interest rates also soared. The move ended up having ripple effects that devastated the overall economy as well as the stock market.

""The difference here is that we do have some forces that I think will help bring down inflation on its own"" House said when comparing the present to late-'70s inflation such as the waning pandemic-era fiscal support that boosted consumer demand and shifting patterns on how consumers are spending their money.

""It's a fine line for monetary policy to walk between not choking off a recovery or an expansion and also not letting it overheat to the point where you have further pain down the road"" she said.

There are also only so many tools at the Fed's disposal she noted saying the Fed can't manufacture semiconductor chips or do much to address the beleaguered global supply side of the equation.

In figuring out how to best anchor inflation without triggering an economic downturn simply put House said the Fed is ""not in a very enviable position.""

So how can Americans protect their hard-earned cash?

At the individual level meanwhile Carnegie Mellon's Spatt warns there is very little consumers can do on their own to tackle inflation as a whole once it takes root in the economy.

""Individuals can of course try to make the best decisions that they can to watch out for themselves"" Spatt said. ""To the extent that they see opportunities for higher wages obviously they should go for those. To the extent that they see prices that haven't yet moved up but they think are going to move up they might want to lock in their purchases.""

To protect their savings Americans ""might want to consider or might be more open to buying bonds or buying equities"" Spatt added.

Uncertainty brought on by inflation has traditionally been bad news for the stock market but at the same time stocks have also been a good source historically for investors looking to grow wealth over the longer term. While there is potential to guard against inflation with sound stock investments (and conversely to further deplete savings with investments that go down in value) going this route comes down to personal risk tolerance and financial goals.

Other savings vehicles that ""may be a little bit better than bank accounts"" in regards to inflation are inflation-protected government savings bonds according to Spatt.

""At least in the near term those [Series] I Bonds are offering extraordinary rates about 7% because of the current levels of inflation"" he added.

These are capped at relatively modest levels he noted but said he still views them as a ""terrific kind of low-risk type of inflation hedge of a different kind than investing in equity.""

Investors can also protect themselves from inflation by purchasing Treasury Inflation Protected Securities or TIPS which were not around during the '70s and also have interest rates adjusted for inflation.

The Treasury has a useful breakdown for Americans comparing I Bonds and TIPS on its website.

As inflation tightens its grip on the economy and previous assurances from policymakers that it is ""transitory"" have gone out the window Spatt said Americans should now recognize ""prices are going to change over time and they're going to change adversely.""

People should keep this in mind when doing their shopping and financial planning and then assess based on individual needs options and goals how they can best adapt to this ever-evolving economic reality.

At the broader level however Scott warned inflation's unwelcome return to the U.S. economy presents ""a tremendous problem.""

""When you think about the policies that may be followed to stamp out the inflation they may actually bring the economy into recession; that may be necessary like it was in the 1980s"" Spatt said. ""It's not easy to knock it out of the economy; this is one of the lessons of the 1980s.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2U1NDNhZGYwLThjNjItNGEyYy1iMmQ5LTAxZmRiMmY1OTVjY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JPMorgan plots 'astonishing' $12bn tech spend to beat fintechs,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

The S&P 500's 2022 struggles continued as bank stocks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season by reporting mixed numbers.

On Tuesday Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee as part of his reconfirmation process. Powell said persistently elevated inflation is a signal the U.S. economy ""no longer needs or wants"" highly accommodative monetary policy measures but added that the ""era of very low interest rates"" is likely here to stay.

Following Powell's testimony the U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday that the consumer price index increased by 7% in December the highest inflation recorded since 1982. The CPI reading was up 0.5% compared with November and in line with economist estimates.

On Monday video game developer Take-Two Interactive announced a $12.7 billion buyout of Zynga maker of popular social media game ""FarmVille."" The $9.86-per-share buyout price represented a 64% premium to Zynga's previous week's closing share price.

Described by the New York Times as one of the “most prominent and admired painters to translate figurative art into a modern idiom” Lennart Anderson (1928-2015) was an American artist renowned for his mastery of tone color and composition and for a teaching career that deeply influenced future generations of painters.

Curated by Lyme Academy’s Artistic Directors Amaya Gurpide and Jordan Sokol in collaboration with the artist’s estate and the New York Studio School Lyme Academy will be the second venue for this first major survey of the artist since his death in 2015.

The exhibition brings together over 25 paintings and drawings from both public and private collections including paintings from the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Bank of New York Mellon Collection as well as from Anderson’s own gallery Leigh Morse Fine Arts.

In addition to several works featured at the exhibition’s opening at the New York Studio School newly selected works that emphasize the artist’s sensitivity to portraiture and the intimate relationships he formed with his subjects will be featured in the Lyme Academy exhibition.

“As a painter I’ve studied Lennart’s work for years so the opportunity to co-curate this exhibition has been particularly meaningful” says Sokol. “Lennart’s paintings brilliantly fuse the figurative tradition with a modern sensibility making his work especially relevant for Lyme Academy as well as generations of painters after him.”

The exhibition is accompanied by a scholarly catalogue that pairs more than 50 full-color reproductions of Anderson’s work with essays by art historians Martica Sawin and Jennifer Samet and painters Susan J. Walp and Paul Resika. Catalogues will be available for purchase at Lyme Academy of Fine Arts during the course of the exhibition.

Born in Detroit Lennart Anderson (Aug. 22 1928 – Oct. 15 2015) studied at the Art Institute of Chicago Cranbrook Academy and at the Art Students League under Edwin Dickinson. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and National Academy.

He received a Guggenheim Fellowship the National Endowment for the Arts grant the Tiffany Foundation grant and the Prix de Rome.

Anderson’s work is in the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum the Cleveland Museum of Art; the Hirshorn Museum and Sculpture Garden the Museum of Fine Arts Boston the Whitney Museum of American Art the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the Delaware Art Museum among others.

He taught at Columbia University Yale University and served as a distinguished professor emeritus of Brooklyn College.

The Estate of Lennart Anderson is represented by his longtime gallerist Leigh Morse Fine Arts New York.

Following its presentation at the Lyme Academy of Fine Arts the exhibition will travel its next venue the Southern Utah Museum of Art.

The Chauncey-Stillman Gallery at Lyme Academy of Fine Arts is located at 84 Lyme St. in Old Lyme Conn. The gallery hours are 10 a.m.to 4 p.m. daily. Entrance to the exhibition is free but donations are welcome. Free parking is offered onsite.

The mission of the Lyme Academy of Fine Arts is to teach the foundational skills of drawing painting and sculpture in the figurative tradition. By its commitment to training students in these skills and an engagement with contemporary discourse the Academy will empower a new generation of artists. Through its programs the Academy is committed to enriching the cultural life of the community.

Peyrefitte: “Again who got the money PM?”,"BELIZE CITY. Wed. Jan. 12 2022– On Tuesday AMANDALA reported that a letter had been sent by the chairman of the UDP Senator Michael Peyrefitte to the Prime Minister Hon. John Briceño to request information about an allocation of $15 million approved in October of last year for the payment of legal and advisory fees for the closing of the Superbond and the financial and legal maneuvers that led to the Blue Bond loan agreement.

On Tuesday of this week a response to Hon. Peyrefitte’s request was issued by the Prime Minister and in the initial part of that response the Prime Minister referred to a key portion of Hon. Peyrefitte’s query: who received the legal and advisory fees paid by the government for the handling of the Suoerbond/Blue Bond negotiations. The letter stated the following: “You… know well Mr. Peyrefitte the identities of the ‘lawyers and advisors who were paid’ to facilitate that process because they are the very individuals and entities who worked on the process during the Barrow administration of which you were a part. And the public also knows who those entities are because multiple press releases and media reports cited these advisors and their respective roles. What unease can you reasonably harbor about the competence and integrity of the legal and financial advisory team that negotiated the Superbond on the country’s behalf when every single firm my Administration retained had previously been contracted by the UDP administration? Thus unless you are feigning ignorance you are well aware of these entities. In essence you are requesting to find out what you already know.”

In a subsequent portion of the letter Prime Minister Briceño lists the firms and advisors who worked on Superbond negotiations over the last decade for both the Barrow and Briceño administrations and who were compensated for their work: “Citi Capital Markets HallMark Advisory Sullivan & Cromwell Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP David Polk Wardwell LLP The Bank of New York Mellon Carter Ledyard and Milburn LLP Equip Global Restructuring LLC and Global Bondholders Services Corporation”. His letter then asserted that other than these well-known professionals who have been working on those negotiations under both UDP and PUP governments of Belize “there are no other firms or individuals that have received compensation from the Government of Belize in these transactions.”

The letter further outlines how the total amount thar was paid was obtained—indicating that funds were secured via three steps: partially by means of “USD $6m in the Fiscal Year 2021/22 Budget for debt restructuring costs” after which “USD $10 m was secured to a component of the Blue Bond financing itself” (which was likely funds borrowed from TNC to partially cover fees of at least some advisors or firms.at the closing of the bond) subsequent to which there was a supplementary allocation of BZD $15 million which he said was a “non-issue”. This piecemeal approach to securing funds to cover fees ultimately resulted according to Briceño in total funds of about USD $16 million along with the BZD $15 million.

The Prime Minister appeared to assert that regardless of how the total amount was pieced together—a portion with US funds another with Belizean dollars with some advisors being paid with a subsequent allocation while others were paid with the TNC loan the list of advisors who received the funds is unchanged. There was an underlying insistence in the letter that regardless of the timing of each advisory firm’s payment every dollar allocated went only to the advisors on the list presented by GOB —the same professionals employed by the previous Barrow administration—and that no one other than those persons who worked on the complex Superbond-Blue Bond transition received such funds. He also indicated a key factor that further determined the amount paid: the fact that some compensation was tied directly to these advisors’ performance —that is the amount of savings they secured.

He then provided a breakdowns of those transaction costs and fees—stating that transaction costs for the Superbond buyout were USD $10226039 and transaction costs for the Blue Bond were USD $4342785 —resulting in total costs of USD $14568824. He then noted that “60% of the fees paid were success and incentive-based financial structuring and conservation advisory fees…while 34% covered legal costs and 6% were for operational expenses.”

The figures presented would appear to indicate that the amount disbursed for the buyback of the Superbond and for the arrangement of the Blue Bond financing transactions was roughy consistent with what was being paid for Superbond negotiations under the previous Barrow administration (which according to PM Briceño’s letter “incurred Superbond restructuring expenses totaling USD 19080111” —almost BZ $40 million— in 2013 and 2017) with additional amounts being calculated based on the incentive portion of the payment arrangement— as a percentage of the hundreds of millions saved during the most recent transactions. 7News thus noted in its newscast on Tuesday “The total costs for the Blue Bond… is on par with the Superbond restructurings — but with far greater savings.”

There appears to be no indication as yet that any additional entities other than the listed firms and advisors who worked on the negotiations had been paid. But Peyrefitte is insisting that documentation must be shown to prove that no other person or firm other than the advisors and companies who worked on the Superbond and Blue Bond negotiations received payment. As mentioned by AMANDALA in the mid-week issue “a helpful reference [point] would be the typical remuneration structures outlined by these [international advisory] companies for transactions of such magnitude. These are an international standard that provide insights into what an advisor involved in orchestrating such a complex deal would receive…”

Peyrefitte responded to the Prime Minisrer’s letter at a UDP press conference this week however by insisting that the Prime Minister did not provide documents corroborating his claims and he further said that the sums paid to the various advisors were not included in the information provided.

Peyrefitte went on to classify the 3-page breakdown of transaction costs as “fluff” and “distractions”. He also made reference to the manner in which the funds were secured to cover the various fees—since those funds came from various sources—with the Briceño administration at the closing of the Superbond opting to borrow an additional 20 million US dollars from the TNC to cover the closing cost of the agreement in addition to 12 million Belize dollars that was allocated in March of 2021 to cover such expenses. And he went on to estimate that at closing the government likely had almost 32 million dollars to cover legal and advisory expenses and then questioned how the 15 million dollars requested in the October supplementary allocation was used and to whom it was paid.

“After you borrowed extra money to pay for the transactions cost of the Blue Bond you went and you asked the National Assembly for an additional 15 million dollars for what? For who? Who got paid out of that? Who got that extra 15 million dollars? The question I ask you is this: after you borrowed 20 million dollars to close the cost you went afterward and ask for an additional 15 million that you cannot explain why you wanted it” Peyerefitte said in his remarks.

Since the figures listed in Hon. Briceño’s letter would place the amount disbursed to the Superbond advisors in the range of typical disbursements for such international transactions especially when the incentive-based portion calculated as a percentage of the hundreds of millions in savings secured is factored into the tabulations it is possible that Hon. Peyrefitte’s concerns/suspicions are based on the timing of the payments related to the Superbond transaction since Peyrefitte prefaced his question with the words “If all of these people have been paid at the closing time of the transaction and the closing time of the restructuring”. The Prime Minister however had not indicated whether some fees were disbursed subsequent to closing time. It is to be noted that a delay in payment to some advisors in itself would not indicate that funds were given to any entity other than the advisors who worked on this deal.

Nonetheless Hon. Peyrefitte insisted “I will write every week if I have to because he has not answered my question. Who got paid out of that 15 million and how much did each person get paid out of that 15 million.”",,,,,,

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath.

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWF0YW5kaHJhLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbmV3cy9kaWQtc2FtYW50aGEtcG9zdC1hLWJhdGhpbmctcGljLWFzLWhlci1pc3RhLXN0b3J5LTEzNzcwNNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vbW9iaS5ncmVhdGFuZGhyYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9kaWQtc2FtYW50aGEtcG9zdC1hLWJhdGhpbmctcGljLWFzLWhlci1pc3RhLXN0b3J5LzEzNzcwNC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Samantha Post a 'bathing' pic as her Ista Story?..,"Samantha's ""Insta Story"" photos have gone viral online.

In this segment from Motley Fool Live recorded on Jan. 4 Fool contributors Toby Bordelon and Lou Whiteman discuss the utility arm of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.96%) (BRK.B 1.01%) and how its ongoing transition to renewable energy has bolstered the stock and made it enticing for investors.

10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (B shares)

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Berkshire Hathaway (B shares) wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of January 10 2022

Toby Bordelon: They have a really big geographic footprint. Berkshire Energy is their utility subsidiary. It used to be called MidAmerican. If you were a longtime Berkshire shareholder you may know that name. They actually changed their name in 2014. It's been a while. They changed from MidAmerican Energy to Berkshire Energy and part of that I think is because of the geographic scope of this company.

Hard to call yourself MidAmerican when you have operations on the West Coast and in the U.K. and in Canada? This is a global utility now. You can see this here. I want to point out these dark green squares all over this map those are actually renewable generation plants.

This is a renewable company too. If you think to yourselves yeah I want to get into energy but you know what I'm all about renewable energy and not about old school utilities in coal and oil and gas so on I want renewable energy. You might give us a look I think.

We're going to get into this a little bit more. I'm going to show you this but you definitely want to give them a close look. They have a lot of renewables going on. Then on the right-hand side you see the revenue they earned from each geography.

My home state of Nevada one of their largest at 16% of their energy revenue coming from there. But it's fairly diverse. A lot of different places this is coming from.

Lou Whiteman: Then the other thing to look at it's a great visualization. But also notice the green blocks but also notice those lines. Those are transmission lines. I didn't read your script Toby but we may be talking about railroads as part of this too. But transmission lines railroad tracks those are things that are hard to build new. It's a valuable asset to own.

Toby Bordelon: Yeah definitely true. You see where a lot of the transmission lines are concentrated in the middle of the country that's where you kind of get this MidAmerica idea from. They own a lot of pipelines a lot of transmission lines going up and down the country.

Here's some stats for Berkshire. First you see the growth in various metrics on the right-hand side there. Growth in assets. They continue to reinvest and grow their property plan equipment growing their cash flow and all that leads into growth in shareholder equity.

Fairly consistent over the years. 9.1 million customers 34 gigawatts of power 36000 miles of transmission lines Lou as we were talking about 21300 miles of pipeline. A lot going on. A lot going in this company very large in scale here.

This is the power generation source of the breakdown here. You see here wind at 33% now 41% total from renewables when you add in the small amount they have from solar hydro and geothermal.

In 2005 they were at 71% from coal. They've come a long way in terms of moving to renewable energy. I remember going to shareholder meetings years ago at Berkshire and all these people from the audience saying something like ""When are you getting into renewables why are you using nasty coal?"" Even then Warren Buffett was like look we're doing more than anyone else and just stay tuned we have a long-term plan and here it is.

They're approaching 50% from renewable sources in terms of regeneration. This is definitely a company I think that is serious about renewable energy and doing it in a pretty good way. But it's not all about like your typical renewable.

This is very interesting they are working on a nuclear power plant in Wyoming. There's been some news on this recently. This is the nuclear plant designed by TerraPower which is Bill Gates' company. He owns that. It's called the Natrium plant is an advanced nuclear reactor. It's got a sodium-cooled reactor some salt-based energy storage.

Interesting things going on here and they can easily integrate with renewable in theory is what they're trying to figure out how to do. We have nuclear can we pair it with renewable to make a nice next-generation power system here? They're doing interesting projects like that all over the place.

One thing I want to note here they don't pay a dividend. When you think about utilities you think about dividend payers. That's typically what they are and why people have traditionally invested in utilities steady dividend payers.

But Berkshire Energy being owned by Berkshire Hathaway doesn't have to do that. They can retain their cash flow within the company which they do. That allows them to reinvest more easily if they need to do new projects because they're able to just build up this cash flow and consistently reinvest.

They don't have to constantly go back to regulators and say we need a rate increase for this project. Now they'll do that when their costs go up. But they have this internally generated cash. They don't have to pay out their shareholders that's available for them. It gives them a little bit of a competitive advantage I think in terms of reinvestment and innovation. That's a very nice position to be in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vbWluZGEtemV0bGluL3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWdvb2dsZS1zZXJnZXktYnJpbi1sYXJyeS1wYWdlLWlwby1wdWJsaWMtc2hhcmVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Warren Buffett Persuaded Google's Reluctant Founders to Go Public,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/warren-buffett-google-sergey-brin-larry-page-ipo-public-shares.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vbWluZGEtemV0bGluL3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWdvb2dsZS1zZXJnZXktYnJpbi1sYXJyeS1wYWdlLWlwby1wdWJsaWMtc2hhcmVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1zYXlzLXZlcnktYmVzdC0xNDAwMDAzNzQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett says these are the best businesses to own — 3 examples from Berkshire's portfolio,"Warren Buffett says these are the best businesses to own — 3 examples from Berkshire's portfolio

Never forget the basics.

While we’re constantly bombarded with confusing investment mumbo jumbo we should never forget that companies largely exist for one main reason: to take capital from investors and earn a return on it.

That’s why it makes sense for investors to look for businesses with durable competitive advantages that are able to consistently deliver high returns on capital.

As Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett once said “[T]he best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return.”

With that in mind here are three Berkshire holdings with double-digit returns on invested capital.

Moody's (MCO)

With returns on invested capital consistently in the mid-20% range credit rating leader Moody’s leads off our list.

Moody’s shares held up incredibly well during the height of the pandemic and are up nearly 220% over the past five years suggesting that it’s a recession-resistant business worth betting on.

Specifically the company’s well-entrenched leadership position in credit ratings which leads to outsized returns on capital should continue to limit Moody’s long-term downside

Moreover Moody’s has generated about $2.4 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow. And over the first three quarters of 2021 the company has returned $975 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

As of Q3 2021 Berkshire holds more than 24.6 million shares of Moody’s worth just under $8.8 billion. Moody’s has a dividend yield of 0.7%.

Apple (AAPL)

Next up we have consumer technology gorilla Apple which boasts a five-year return on invested capital of 28% much higher than that of rivals like Nokia (-3%) and Sony (12%).

Even in the cutthroat world of consumer hardware the iPhone maker has been able to generate outsized returns due to its loyalty-commanding brand and high switching costs (the iOS experience can only be had through Apple products).

And with the company continuing to penetrate emerging markets like India and Mexico Apple’s long-term growth trajectory remains healthy.

In the most recent quarter Apple’s revenue jumped 29% to $83.4 billion. The company also returned over $24 billion to shareholders.

The stock currently sports a dividend yield of just 0.5% but with a buyback yield of 3% Apple is doling out more cash to shareholders than you might think.

It's no wonder that Apple is Berkshire's largest public holding owning more than 887 million shares in the tech giant worth roughly $125.5 billion.

Procter & Gamble (PG)

Rounding out the list is consumer staples giant Procter & Gamble with a solid five-year average return on invested capital of 13.5%.

Berkshire held 315400 shares at the end of Q3 worth around $44 million at today’s price. While that’s not a big position by Berkshire standards something does make P&G stand out: the ability to deliver rising cash returns to investors through thick and thin.

The company offers a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels Crest toothpaste Gillette razor blades and Tide detergent. These are products households buy on a regular basis regardless of what the economy is doing.

In April P&G’s board of directors announced a 10% increase to the quarterly payout marking the company’s 65th consecutive annual dividend hike.

P&G share currently offer a dividend yield of 2.2%.

The Ivan Sher Group The No. 2 sale of 2021 was a high-rise unit at One Queensridge Place that sold for $5.6 million.

The Ivan Sher Group A $4.5 million price tag for a One Queensridge Place condo came in at the No. 4 sale of the year.

The Ivan Sher Group The No. 5 high-rise condo sale was this 43rd-floor penthouse at Sky Las Vegas which sold for $4.35 million.

Cristine Rosa Lefkowitz The No. 3 high-rise condo sale of the year was a penthouse at Park Towers at Hughes Center which sold for $5.5 million.

The Ivan Sher Group A $4.5 million price tag for a One Queensridge Place condo came in at the No. 4 sale of the year.

Elite Realty A nearly 13000-square-foot penthouse in The Martin condo tower off the Las Vegas Strip sold for $16.25 million earlier this year. It was the No. 1 high-rise condo sale in 2021.

Elite Realty This 13000-square-foot penthouse in The Martin condo tower off the Las Vegas Strip broke the all-time record for the highest price paid for any high-rise unit. It sold for $16.25 million earlier this year.

The Las Vegas high-rise market broke its all-time record in 2021 by more than doubling sales from 2020 and recording the highest price ever paid at $16.25 million for a unit at The Martin.

It’s a remarkable turnaround for condo sales after a 2020 that saw sales fall 18 percent to 584 from 692 in 2019 because the COVID-19 pandemic pushed people to want more isolation and single-family homes rather than be around other people. That turned around in 2020 as people felt protected by vaccinations and high-rises reopened pools gyms spas salons restaurants and other amenities buyers desired.

In 2021 Las Vegas saw 1321 sales in high-rises of five stories according to Forrest Barbee corporate broker with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Arizona California and Nevada Properties who tracks the Las Vegas Realtors association multiple listing service.

The 1321 sales beat the all-time record of 970 sales in 2017. The number had been sliding every year since then before 2021.

The annual report issued by research firm Applied Analysis which tracks 21 high-rises along and near Las Vegas Boulevard and downtown and One Queensridge Place in the west valley showed there were 1161 sales in 2021 up from 505 in 2020 and 607 in 2019.

The average price paid for a unit in one of those 21 high-rise towers was $561252 in 2021 a 6 percent increase over the $527831 paid in 2020. The average price per square foot was $427 a 6 percent increase over the 401 paid in 2020 according to Applied Analysis.

Realtors say while they’re monitoring the impact from the omicron variant 2022 is off to a good start for the high-rise market. The strong sales in 2021 however mean there are fewer units on the market. Applied Analysis reported 228 units were listed at the end of 2021 with an average price of $1.15 million or $707 per square foot.

In contrast 580 units were on the market at the end of 2020 with an average price of $783655 or $552 per square foot. At the end of 2019 there were 458 units with an average price of $757916 or $543 per square foot.

“The high-rise story is similar (to single-family homes) from a volume perspective but pricing didn’t necessarily parallel the single-family luxury market” said Anthony Spiegel a Realtor with the Ivan Sher Group of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties. He had the No. 2 sale of 2021 at One Queensridge Place for $5.6 million the No. 4 sale for $4.5 million at One Queensridge Place and the No. 5 sale a 43rd-floor penthouse at Sky Las Vegas for $4.35 million.

“High-rise is still recovering from an unusually asymmetrical effect from COVID due to social distancing and a move toward lower-density living” Spiegel said. “Yes the total high-rise sales were up from 584 in 2020 to 1321 in 2021 an increase of 126 percent but average sales prices and prices per square foot were relatively untouched. In some buildings like One Queensridge Place you did see record prices for units in the building but you also saw record lows.”

For 2022 Spiegel said Las Vegas will continue to see a record number of sales and expects to see some price appreciation especially in buildings outside of the Waldorf Astoria which has historically retained its high valuations. “As we continue to attract a more sophisticated buyer who is accustomed to higher-density living and specifically high-rises — like those from New York City Miami Chicago San Francisco as well as internationally — the demand will continue to rise. Remember that Vegas is essentially a single-family market with a sprinkling of high-rise products.”

Frank Napoli a Realtor with the Frank Napoli Group at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices who represented the buyer on the No. 3 sale at Park Towers at Hughes Center for $5.5 million called it a great year for high-rises coming out of 2020 when the rest of the real estate market took off.

“During 2020 a lot of amenities (gyms pools) were shut down which really had an impact on-high rises on the Strip because not only were the building amenities shut down but the neighborhood amenities were shut down as well” Napoli said. “There was fear because we didn’t know what the virus was. Living in common areas and sharing elevators hallways and lobbies made people nervous.”

Napoli said the single-family market did well in 2020 because people were moving out of high-rises to get into homes and new buyers were looking at single-family homes instead of condos. That’s now changed and he has a three-story penthouse unit at Sky Las Vegas on the market for $5.99 million — a unit he calls the “crown jewel” at the high-rise that measures 5200 square feet and includes four bedrooms and six terraces.

“In 2021 confidence in that type of living went back to normal” Napoli said. “I see that continuing through this year. High-rise is a great option for anybody looking for a primary residence secondary home or investment property. I have clients now that are taking (investment money) out of neighboring states to Las Vegas where we would be looking at single-family or commercial space high-rise is now a more common option for these buyers. They rent well show a good return and the numbers still haven’t caught up to the rest of the market in terms of appreciation.”

Napoli said a lack of inventory of single-family homes helped prompt buyers in 2021 to choose high-rises as a second option. High-rises such as Park Towers and One Queensridge Place also made improvements that enticed buyers and now the Waldorf Astoria is making upgrades as well he added.

Barbee said the problems the high-rise market faced in 2020 with confidence levels during COVID-19 and the ability to finance condo units has been overcome. There’s also greater interest because the price or some condos are more affordable than single-family homes.

“There’s suddenly a lot of confidence here in this market and the other banks are playing ball and providing financing that weren’t before” Barbee said. “Suddenly we got sports teams coming from everywhere and there’s got to be a number of people that are speculating that they’re going to be able to rent them out at high prices during events like New Year’s Eve and the Super Bowl. You can make some short-term rental money. And regardless of what the prices are here they pale in comparison to the prices in New York London and Zurich. They are still a bargain for people used to that lifestyle.”

Michelle Manley a luxury Realtor for Award Realty said they’re as busy as ever as they enter 2022. She closed on a two-bedroom condo on the 33rd floor at the Waldorf Astoria for $4.08 million. It was the No. 7 sale for the year with the buyer from the San Francisco Bay Area choosing it as a primary residence.

“There was a time when people wanted out of high-rises because they didn’t want to ride an elevator with someone” Manley said. “The demand has been incredible since the high-rises opened their amenities back up. The floodgates opened and people are leaving California in droves. It’s the pent-up demand from the shutdown.”

Manley said she doesn’t see buyers frightened off by the omicron variant at the moment but doesn’t know if that will change. There are plenty of people attracted to the high-rise lifestyle she said.

“We have tremendous interest and are getting a lot of calls” Manley said. “I put another one-bedroom under contract at the Waldorf (Wednesday). I’m expecting a great market and for things to continue.”

The highest current listing on the market is for $15 million at Panorama Towers. The three-story unit has more than 8000 square feet. The No. 2 listing is $10 million at The Martin which is part of the three-tower Panorama Tower complex that had the record sale of the year at $16.25 million.

That record-selling penthouse measures 12940 square feet and has five bedrooms including two master bedrooms and eight bathrooms and has an additional 2000 square feet of balcony space with four terraces. It has a 360-degree view of the entire valley.

It’s equipped with a professional gym steam room sauna and cold plunge. It has a catering kitchen private wine room bar game room and theater. It also has a custom circular fish tank that has a bed in the middle where you can watch the fish swim around.

“To have the biggest sale is great” said listing agent Michael McGraw a Realtor with Elite Realty who says his previous high was $7.5 million for a single-family home. “It was a one-of-a-kind property. It’s the best year I have had in 22 years of doing real estate. It was crazy during COVID having had it twice myself.”

Cristine Rosa Lefkowitz a Realtor with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties said she sees no sign of the high-rise marketplace slowing. She had the listing on the No. 3 sale of the year at Park Towers and has an active listing for $9.8 million at the top-floor penthouse at Turnberry Place. It covers more than 10000 square feet with six bedrooms and private terraces. It covers the 38th and 39th floors and Lefkowitz calls it a house in the sky with high-end finishes.

“I had one of the best years of my career last year” Lefkowitz said. “Thank God. I’m very grateful because 2020 was a really bad year for high-rises. It proved to be a winner in 2021. The luxury high-rises are strong.”

The money manager reported net income of $1.64 billion or $10.63 a share in the fourth quarter up 6% from $1.55 billion or $10.02 in the same period a year earlier. Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence predicted per-share profit of $10.22.

Revenue rose 14% to $5.11 billion slightly below analysts’ average estimate of $5.15 billion.

The company’s shares fell 2.2% on Friday. Analysts said some investors were concerned interest-rate increases and higher expenses might weigh on 2022 results.

BlackRock ended the year with $10.01 trillion in assets the first time any money manager has surpassed the milestone. The firm is the top seller of exchange-traded funds and demand for ETFs and other low-cost investments that track market indexes has fueled BlackRock’s transformation from a bond-investing specialist to the world’s largest money manager.

In the fourth quarter though BlackRock benefited from strong inflows into its actively managed investments. Active funds brought in nearly half of the $211.7 billion in net new client money the firm added in the period.

The pickup in the active business which includes stock- and bond-picking funds and alternative investments like infrastructure real estate and private debt has helped BlackRock counter the downward pressure on fees all money managers have faced as many investors turned to index funds. While active funds account for about a quarter of BlackRock’s assets they contributed almost half of the manager’s fees during the fourth quarter.

On a conference call with analysts BlackRock Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Fink said the firm’s active business was now benefiting from the build-outs it had made to both its investment teams and its sales organization. Big pensions endowments and other institutional clients are turning to a handful of asset managers to oversee a larger slice of their assets Mr. Fink said. That also helps BlackRock as one of only a few firms that has both large active and passive platforms.

“We are probably the best-positioned organization in the world to meet those types of opportunities"" he said. “If anything I think that momentum is going to accelerate going forward.""

Some investors worry BlackRock’s active-investing business might lose steam in the new year said Brennan Hawken an analyst with UBS Group AG. A big chunk of the firm’s fourth-quarter inflows poured into bond funds.

“As you’ve seen from the rate market year to date rates are backing up pretty hard"" Mr. Hawken said. “The idea that that fixed-income strength would continue may not be a home run.""

BlackRock’s annualized fee rate fell slightly in the fourth quarter from the third signaling the money manager’s revenue growth might slow he said.

On Friday’s call BlackRock finance chief Gary Shedlin said the manager planned to boost its workforce by as much as 10% this year as it builds out its businesses. Continued technology investments will help increase core general and administrative expenses by 15% to 20% he said.

For the year BlackRock earned $5.9 billion or $38.22 a share on revenue of $19.37 billion.

BlackRock’s shares fell $23.44 to $844.14 on Friday afternoon.

Written by Christopher Liew CFA at The Motley Fool Canada

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are great options if you want instant diversification. Besides reducing risk investing in ETFs requires less or little monitoring. On the TSX some Canadian ETFs offer exposure to the country’s entire economy. Other ETFs like BlackRock iShares S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF (TSX:XEG) are industry specific.

That ETF is a top pick if you only seek exposure to Canada’s energy sector. It tracks the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index to the extent possible net of expenses and provides investors with long-term capital growth. The holdings of BlackRock XEG are in 22 energy stocks.

ADVERTISEMENT

BlackRock’s top 10 holdings include Canadian Natural Resources Suncor Energy Cenovus Energy and Tourmaline Oil. Nearly all of the energy stocks in the portfolio were top performers in 2021. However conspicuously absent from the ETF’s holding is Enbridge (TSX:ENB)(NYSE:ENB). I’d choose the pipeline giant over other energy stocks and energy ETFs any time of the day.

Oldest ETF

XEG is one of the oldest ETFs in Canada. BlackRock a multinational investment management corporation allocates the funds to Canada’s energy sector without diversifying into other industries. Because XEG is an all-equity ETF there is zero exposure to fixed-income securities like bonds and guaranteed investment certificates (GICs).

BlackRock divides the funds within the energy sector’s different segments. However the top two most significant asset allocations skew towards Oil & Gas Exploration & Production and Integrated Oil & Gas. As of January 11 2022 the allocation for the former is 56.42% while it is 42.76% is for the latter.

XEG is a pure-play energy sector ETF that expresses the energy industry view. However its performance depends on Canada’s oil sands operations. The perennial threat to the ETF is the commodity price volatility that affects total returns. Energy was the top-performing sector in 2021 and XEG’s total return was 82.81%.

Investment thesis

A single-stock investment isn’t a widely used strategy anymore although Enbridge is a solid choice if you want to invest in only one stock. The $97.41 billion energy infrastructure company has a dividend-growth streak of 27 years. This top-tier energy stock trades at $52.12 per share and pays a generous 6.62% dividend.

Enbridge has four blue-chip franchises that provide predictable cash flows in all market cycles. Due to two important factors the company maintains an industry-leading low-risk commercial and financial profile. About 95% of customers are investment grade and 98% of services are fully contracted.

According to management each of its businesses has high visibility to attractive organic growth opportunities that will drive future cash flow growth. Enbridge has up to $6 billion of organic growth potential annually. Also about 80% of its EBITDA has inflation protection.

Enbridge has $19 billion worth of secured growth projects through 2024. Management is fully aware that its shareholders expect Enbridge to generate strong financial performance and returns on the capital in 2022. Also the utility-like approach and disciplined investment in energy infrastructure should translate to superior returns in the long term.

No problem with Enbridge

The energy ETF is an excellent option if you want exposure to Canada’s hot energy sector. However declining commodity prices low crude oil demand and several other factors could negatively impact the ETF. Investors won’t have problems of that sort with Enbridge and it can overcome industry headwinds and keep dividends flowing every year.

This becomes relevant as pharmaceutical companies are driving responses to Covid-19 which until now have endangered public health rather than optimizing it. The traditional media have been complicit willing to spread their propaganda a false official narrative that leads the public astray and fosters fear based on lies.

BlackRock and Vanguard form a secret monopoly that also owns just about everything they can think of. In total they own 1600 U.S. companies which in 2015 had combined revenues of $ 9.1 billion. When you add the third-largest global owner State Street their combined ownership encompasses nearly 90% of all S&P 500 firms.

Vanguard is the largest shareholder in BlackRock. Vanguard itself on the other hand has a unique structure that makes its property more difficult to discern but many of the oldest and richest families in the world can be linked to Vanguard funds.

What do The New York Times and most other legacy outlets have in common with Big Pharma? Answer: They are largely owned by BlackRock and Vanguard Group the two largest asset management firms in the world. Furthermore it turns out that these two companies form a secret monopoly that also owns just about everything you can think of.

“The shares of the largest corporations in the world belong to the same institutional investors. They all own each other. This means that “competing” brands such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi are not competitors since their shares belong to exactly the same investment companies mutual funds insurance companies banks and in some cases governments … Smaller investors are owned by larger investors.

The visible top of this pyramid shows only two companies whose names we have seen often: Vanguard and BlackRock… The power of these two companies is beyond your imagination. Not only do they own a large portion of the stocks but also the shares of investors in those companies. This gives them a complete monopoly… A report by Bloomberg affirms that both companies in the year 2028 together will have investments amounting to US $ 20000 million. That means they own almost everything.”

Who are the Vanguards



The word “vanguard” means “the leading position in an army or fleet advancing into battle” and “the leading position in a trend or movement.” Both are apt descriptions of this world behemoth owned by globalists pushing for a Great Reset the core of which is the transfer of wealth and property from the hands of the majority to the hands of the very few.

Interestingly Vanguard is the largest shareholder in BlackRock (March 2021). Vanguard itself on the other hand has a “unique” corporate structure that makes its ownership more difficult to discern. It is owned by its various funds which in turn are owned by shareholders. Apart from these shareholders it has no outside investors and is not listed on the stock market.

“The elite that owns Vanguard apparently don’t like being the center of attention but of course they can’t hide from who’s willing to dig. Oxfam and Bloomberg reports say that 1% of the world together owns more money than the other 99%. Worse still Oxfam says that 82% of all money earned in 2017 went to this 1%…. In other words these two investment companies Vanguard and BlackRock have a monopoly on all the industries in the world and in turn belong to the richest families in the world some of whom are royalty and who have been very rich since before the Industrial Revolution”.

While it would take time to sift through all Vanguard funds to identify individual shareholders and therefore Vanguard owners a quick look suggests that Rothschild Investment Corp. and Edmond De Rothschild Holding are two such stakeholders. Keep the Rothschild name in mind as you read as it will appear again later.

The Italian Orsini family the American Bush family the British royal family the Du Pont family the Morgans Vanderbilts and Rockefellers are identified as owners of Vanguard.

BlackRock and Vanguard own Big Pharma



According to Simply Wall Street as of February 2020 BlackRock and Vanguard were the two largest shareholders in GlaxoSmithKline holding 7% and 3.5% of the shares respectively. At Pfizer the ownership is invested with Vanguard being the largest investor and BlackRock the second largest shareholder.

Keep in mind that stock ownership indices can change at any time as companies buy and sell on a regular basis so don’t get hung up on percentages. The bottom line is that BlackRock and Vanguard individually and combined own enough stock at any given time that we can easily say that they easily control both Big Pharma and centralized legacy media and more.

It matters because pharmaceutical companies are driving responses to Covid-19 all of which so far have endangered public health rather than optimizing it and traditional media outlets have been complicit willing to spread their propaganda an Official false narrative that has and still is misleading audiences and fostering fear based on lies.

To have any chance of correcting this we must understand who the central actors are where the damaging dictates are coming from and why these false narratives are being created in the first place.

As noted in Global Justice Now’s December 2020 report “Big Pharma’s Horrifying Story” we simply cannot allow pharmaceutical companies “which have a long history of prioritizing corporate profits over corporate health. people” continue to dictate Covid-19 responses.

In it they review the shameful history of the world’s top seven pharmaceutical companies that are now developing and manufacturing gene-based drugs and “vaccines” against Covid-19 while the mainstream media has helped suppress information on older drugs. readily available that have been shown to be highly effective against infection.

BlackRock and Vanguard own the media



When it comes to The New York Times in May 2021 BlackRock is the second largest shareholder with 7.43% of total shares just after The Vanguard Group which owns the largest share (8.11%).

In addition to The New York Times Vanguard and BlackRock are also the two main owners of Time Warner Comcast Disney and News Corp four of the six media companies that control more than 90% of the US media landscape.

It goes without saying that if you are in control of so many media outlets you can control entire nations through carefully orchestrated and organized centralized propaganda disguised as journalism.

BlackRock and Vanguard together form a hidden monopoly on global asset holding and through their influence over centralized media have the power to manipulate and control a large part of the world’s economy and events and how the world sees everything.

Given that BlackRock announced in 2018 that it has “societal expectations” of the companies it invests in its potential role as a lynchpin in the Great Reboot and “build back better” plan cannot be overlooked.

This information demonstrates how competition is “undermined by owning shares in competing companies” and “blurs the lines between private equity and government affairs by working closely with regulators” and it would be hard not to see how BlackRock and Vanguard facilitate the Big Reboot and the so-called “green” revolution both of which are part of the same wealth theft scheme.



BlackRock and Vanguard own the world



That claim will be even clearer once you realize that this duo’s influence is not limited to Big Pharma and the media. Importantly BlackRock also works closely with central banks around the world including the United States Federal Reserve which is a private not a federal entity. It lends money to the Central Bank acts as an advisor to the Central Bank and develops the Central Bank software.

BlackRock and Vanguard also own shares in a long list of other companies including Microsoft Apple Amazon Facebook and Alphabet Inc. From 2017’s “These Three Companies Own America” ​​on The Conversation it would be nearly impossible to list them all.

A global monopoly few know about



How can we link BlackRock and Vanguard and the globalist families that own them to the Great Reboot? Barring a public confession we have to analyze the relationships between these gigantic globalist-owned corporations and consider the influence they can exert through those relationships. As Lew Rockwell noted: “When Rothschild’s Lynn Forester wants the United States to be a one-party country (like China) and does not want voter identification laws passed in the United States so that more electoral fraud can be perpetrated to achieve that end.

What do they do?



Forester holds a conference call with the world’s top 100 CEOs and tells them to publicly denounce the passage of Georgia’s anti-corruption law as ‘Jim Crow’ and order his obedient CEOs to boycott the state of Georgia as we saw with Coca- Cola and Major League Baseball and even Hollywood star Will Smith… In this conference call we see shadows of the Great Reset the 2030 Agenda the New World Order.

The UN wants to make sure like [World Economic Forum founder and CEO Klaus] Schwab that by 2030 poverty hunger pollution and disease no longer plague the Earth… To achieve this The UN wants the taxes of western countries to be divided by the elite mega-corporations to create a completely new society. For this project the UN says we need a world government that is the UN itself. “

It seems then quite clear that the alleged solutions for the Covid-19 pandemic was orchestrated to bring about this New World Order the Great Reboot. At the center of it all is the “heart” into which all streams of global wealth flow: BlackRock and Vanguard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbnNtZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvYm9sdC1yYWlzZXMtMzU1bS1pbi1zZXJpZXMtZS1mdW5kaW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bolt Raises $355M in Series E Funding,"Bolt a San Francisco CA-based checkout and shopper network company secured $355m in the first part of its Series E funding.

Hochul,"Gov. Kathy Hochul looked like she had the state’s fat-cat ­donor club so in her pocket that she could easily glide above a couple of Democratic primary opponents — and whomever the GOP throws at her in the 2022 governor’s race.

Then came Alvin Bragg.

I hear that several Big Business community fund­raisers who have either given to Hochul or planned to do so are now looking to play hardball because she’s gone silent on the new Manhattan DA and his loopy get-out-of-jail card for criminals.

Bragg has become the poster child for “progressive” reforms thanks to a leaked policy mandate that outlined his heinous plans to allow most criminals to go free. And as I was first to report last week the New York business community is going nuts. The city needs business and tourism in Manhattan to flourish or it’s doomed.

Continued high crime is the quickest way to kill the city’s economy (remember pre-Giuliani NYC?). So big biz bombarded their normally reticent lobbying group the Partnership for New York City — and its normally restrained CEO Kathryn Wylde — with some blistering calls for action.

‘Misunderstood’?

After feeling like a piñata Wylde turned to Bragg and asked for a meeting. He politely obliged and told Wylde his policies were being “misunderstood” without specifying what part of the memo that he wrote was taken out of context.

If it’s hard to digest the absurdity of all of that you’re not alone. Members of the partnership — which includes some of the biggest most powerful players in corporate America since nearly all the big banks and real estate outfits are located here — aren’t waiting for their Jan. 21 scheduled meeting with Bragg to take action.

3 Gov. Kathy Hochul looked like she would win over businesses but the lack of response to Alvin Bragg’s reforms has some weary. AP Photo/Hans Pennink Pool

In fact as I’ve heard from several NYC business leaders they’ve heard enough from Bragg already and want either him out or his policies banished to some Ivy League college safe space.

They believe Hochul as governor is best equipped to do that. There are no recall elections in New York state. Elected officials can be removed for “any misconduct mal­administration malfeasance or malversation in office” after an application is submitted by “any citizen resident of such town village improvement … to the Appellate Division of the [state] Supreme Court.”

There is some talk from city business leaders to do just that but even they would concede it’s a long shot. That leaves it up to Hochul.

She could pressure Bragg from the bully pulpit and state unequivocally that his policies would endanger every man woman and child who walks the streets of Manhattan.

And while she does that Hochul could appoint a special prosecutor to bring cases that Bragg refuses to one prominent business leader told me.

Again not a word from the governor on any of this which has the donor set pretty peeved. My business-community sources say Hochul at least for now doesn’t want to upset the lefties as she’s still dealing with some election-primary challenges.

That doesn’t mean the business community is powerless to force Hochul do something about Bragg. A few told me they will soon make clear to her that New Yorkers are not as lefty as the state’s party leaders AOC or Bragg. It’s why Eric Adams who embraced the business community and vowed to crack down on crime was elected mayor.

3 Some of the NY business community is not pleased with Bragg’s policies. AP

They also tell me Hochul may have to choose between their campaign contributions or tacit support of Bragg’s idiocy if she doesn’t wise up.

Hochul’s didn’t return a telephone call or e-mail seeking comment.

A CEO in waiting

When Wall Street veteran Gregory Fleming went to the fledgling Rockefeller Capital Management as its CEO in 2017 the financial chattering class was shocked: This guy is Big Bank CEO material. He put together some of the biggest financial deals in recent history and saved Merrill Lynch during the financial crisis by selling it to Bank of America. He even arranged Derek Jeter’s purchase of the Miami Marlins. He could do better than that.

Since joining Rockefeller Fleming is doing pretty well in growing assets and setting the stage to it sell it to a major bank — while setting himself up to get that bank CEO job he has long cherished investment banking sources tell The Post.

All big firms want what Rockefeller does: Wealth management. Dispensing financial advice to rich people is a stable source of revenue.

Fleming brokers have now accumulated close to $100 billion in assets from almost nil when he started. The clients are rich so the firm would be a great fit I am told for Goldman Sachs if 60-year-old CEO David Solomon wanted to share some power and appoint a successor. JPM’s Jamie Dimon might be a buyer and at 65 he could flick Fleming in as his No. 2 with a promise to run the show when he leaves.

Other names include PNC Financial Services and BlackRock the world’s largest money-management firm since its CEO Larry Fink 69 and Fleming 58 are close friends.

One thing appears to be certain: Fleming’s last job won’t be running Rockefeller. Fleming had no comment."

Oatly a Swedish company that makes oat-based versions of milk ice cream and cream cheese says it is on a mission to combat climate change by replacing cow's milk. Oatly has done a lot of research to show that producing cow's milk creates considerably more greenhouse gases than producing oat milk does.

The Trump administration has taken more than 130 separate steps to stop fighting climate change including pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement (via BBC).

Thomas Pallini/Insider

The Boeing 777X is primed to be a popular seller in the private jet and cargo realms in addition to commercial airlines.

Cargo carriers are looking to grow their fleets amid a boom in demand while a 777X private jet can be sold to governments and heads of state.

Delays in the aircraft's certification mean that cargo airlines and private jet buyers will be waiting years for their planes.

Boeing's new flagship aircraft has the potential to be a jack of all trades. But right now it's a master of none.

The Boeing 777X is on track to be certified in late 2023 and there's growing demand for the world's largest twin-engine passenger jet to fly more than just airline passengers. Boeing's commercial derivatives program is tasked with developing alternative uses for the manufacturer's commercial aircraft and the largest contender outside of the airline realm may be in air cargo.

Cargo carriers are already aware of Boeing's strengths in developing freighter aircraft as nearly every one of the manufacturer's commercial aircraft has a freighter variant. And a Boeing 777X Freighter would be the natural next step for cargo carriers flying the Boeing 777 Freighter.

Airbus however has secured momentum in the cargo realm by launching the A350 Freighter at the Dubai Airshow in November. Global airlines including Air France and Singapore Airlines have already placed orders and made commitments for the aircraft which may fly as early as 2025.

""[Airbus] in particular in my view have done incredible work … in terms of coming up with an incredibly unique aircraft"" Nabil Sultan Emirates SkyCargo's divisional senior vice president told Insider.

But Emirates faces the same problem as its counterparts in that there's a desire to expand their fleets now amid a booming period for the air cargo industry. Tiding Emirates over until the Boeing 777X Freighter and Airbus A350F are certified and ready for deliveries is a purchase of two current-generation Boeing 777 Freighters and conversion plans for four Boeing 777-300ER passenger aircraft to be turned into cargo planes by Israel Aerospace Industries.

Boeing's backlog with certifying its commercial aircraft like the 777X 737 Max 7 and 737 Max 10 is preventing the manufacturer from launching the 777X Freighter according to Mike Fleming Boeing's senior vice president in charge of commercial customer support and commercial derivative programs.

Qatar Airways plans to grow its cargo fleet and may be among the first to place an order for the 777X Freighter once the program finally does launch. Akbar Al Baker chief executive officer of Qatar Airways told Reuters that Boeing has offered the 777X Freighter for his cargo division.

Boeing is already a natural choice to refresh the Qatar Airways Cargo fleet considering that the majority of its aircraft are Boeing 777 Freighters. But a dispute with Airbus over the paint quality on the A350 XWB aircraft delivered to Qatar Airways may make Boeing an even more likely partner.

A lesser-known division of Boeing is also preparing to launch the 777X as a private jet. Boeing Business Jets caters to the top tier of travelers even beyond ultra-high-net-worth individuals and is expecting customers for the 777X airliner-turned-private-jet to be the likes of national governments royal families and heads of state.

""That will be really the flagship for [Boeing Business Jets and] hopefully in the next couple of years we'll get our first sale"" JD Detwiler president of Boeing Business Jets said of the 777X in Dubai. ""That aircraft has the ability to link any two cities on the planet it has an effective range approaching 12000 nautical miles.""

And its $442.2 million price tag is just the tipping point as interior completions can cost millions and take more than two years to finish.







""You're probably looking at five years if you sign a contract for a 777X right now because it takes longer to build it and then it takes much longer to do the interior"" Detwiler told Insider noting that only a handful of firms are licensed by Boeing to complete aircraft interiors.

But before any 777X Freighter or Boeing Business Jet is delivered passengers airlines will have to get their overdue deliveries first.

As of now Boeing is still undergoing flight testing and certification trials to ensure that its new flagship will meet the revised delivery timeline of late 2023. The only passengers that get to fly on the aircraft are a team of flight test engineers and pilots that are putting the aircraft through its paces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvYWlybGluZS1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDEvMTUvZmFhLTUtZy1ib2VpbmctNzg3LzY1NDI4NzIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAA orders some Boeing operators to take extra precautions when landing due to 5G rollout,"David Koenig

Associated Press

Federal safety officials are directing operators of some Boeing planes to adopt extra procedures when landing on wet or snowy runways near impending 5G service because they say interference from the wireless networks could mean that the planes need more room to land.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that interference could delay systems like thrust reversers on Boeing 787s from kicking in leaving only the brakes to slow the jet.

That “could prevent an aircraft from stopping on the runway” the FAA said.

Similar orders could be issued in the coming days for other planes. The FAA has asked Boeing and Airbus for information about many models. Boeing said it was working with its suppliers airlines telecom companies and regulators “to ensure that every commercial airplane model can safely and confidently operate when 5G is implemented in the United States.”

► 5G deployment:How 5G could make a mess of your next flight

FAA still studying 5G impact

The order for the Boeing jets comes a day after the FAA began issuing restrictions that airlines and other aircraft operators will face at many airports when AT&T and Verizon launch new faster 5G wireless service Wednesday.

The agency is still studying whether those wireless networks will interfere with altimeters which measure an aircraft’s altitude. Data from altimeters is used to help pilots land when visibility is poor.

The devices operate on a portion of the radio spectrum that is close to the range used by the new 5G service called C-Band.

This week’s FAA actions are part of a larger fight between the aviation regulator and the telecom industry. The telecom companies and the Federal Communications Commission say 5G networks do not pose a threat to aviation. The FAA says more study is needed.

The FAA is conducting tests to learn how many commercial planes have altimeters that might be vulnerable to spectrum interference. The agency said this week that it expects to estimate the percentage of those planes soon but it didn’t say when.

“Aircraft with untested altimeters or that need retrofitting or replacement will be unable to perform low-visibility landings where 5G is deployed” the agency said in a statement.

► 5G delay:AT&T Verizon delay new 5G service by 2 weeks after request from DOT Secretary Buttigieg

More than 100 U.S. planes affected

The order on Boeing 787s covers 137 planes in the U.S. and 1010 worldwide.

The 787 is a two-aisle plane that is popular on longer routes including many international flights. The FAA said that based on information from Boeing the 787s might not shift properly from flying to landing mode if there is interference which could delay the activation of systems that help slow the plane.

AT&T and Verizon have twice agreed to postpone activating their new networks because of concerns raised by aviation groups and the FAA most recently after the FAA and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg weighed in on the aviation industry’s side. Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson warned that flights could be canceled or diverted to avoid possible safety risks.

Under an agreement with the telecom companies the FAA designated 50 airports that will have buffer zones in which the companies will turn off 5G transmitters or make other changes to limit potential interference through early July.

The 50 include the three major airports in the New York City area – LaGuardia JFK and Newark Liberty – O’Hare and Midway in Chicago Dallas/Fort Worth International Bush Intercontinental in Houston Los Angeles International and San Francisco.

That concession by the telecoms was modeled after an approach used in France although the FAA said last week that France requires more dramatic reductions in cell tower reach around airports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3LWVuZ2xhbmQtcGF0cmlvdHMtYm9laW5nLTc2Ny_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Look At The New England Patriots' Boeing 767,"Recently I wrote about how the Arizona Cardinals picked up a Boeing 777 which used to fly for Delta. As I mentioned at the time the Cardinals are the second NFL team to operate their own plane as the New England Patriots have had a Boeing 767 for several years now. There’s now an interesting new video about that plane.

New England Patriots show off private plane

I guess the Patriots were feeling a bit jealous about the media attention that the Cardinals were getting for their plane so they just put out a fascinating 10 minute video about the team’s Boeing 767 which avgeeks will no doubt enjoy.

The Patriots have a video series called “Do Your Job” giving a behind the scenes look at various things that make the team run. The latest episode is all about the Patriots’ “AirKraft” (named after the Kraft family which owns the team):

Basics of the New England Patriots’ Boeing 767-300

Here’s a summary of the basics of the Patriots’ aircraft some of which is mentioned in the video and some of which isn’t:

The Patriots first picked up two Boeing 767-300s in 2017 and they reportedly cost $10 million total (there are some bargains to be had when buying used aircraft)

In 2020 the Patriots dumped their “spare” Boeing 767 (registration code N225NE) as it’s now operated by Eastern

The Patriots’ remaining Boeing 767-300 has the registration code N36NE and it’s a 31 year old plane that was produced in 1991

The plane flew with American Airlines until 2016 and then in 2017 it started transporting the New England Patriots

The plane is actually operated by Eastern Airlines on behalf of the Patriots so Eastern Airlines provides the crews maintenance etc.

The plane is in a premium configuration with most seats being the equivalent to what you’d find in domestic first class; after all the standard capacity of a Boeing 767-300 isn’t really needed here and football players are typically larger than your average passenger

The reason for picking up a private plane is that the logistics of charters with airlines can often be complicated so picking up a cheap plane on the secondhand market can be a good option

In the last season the Patriots team flew 44 hours and 17000 miles for away game transportation

In addition to the primary mission of transporting team members the plane has also operated all kinds of other missions from picking up over a million masks in China early in the pandemic to transporting healthcare workers to last year’s Super Bowl in Tampa

Bottom line

Back in 2017 the New England Patriots became the first NFL team to pick up a private plane to transport teams. Airline NFL charters can be complicated so this gave the team a lot more comfort and control for traveling to away games.

The Patriots just put out a video showcasing the plane’s operations and it’s really cool to see how it’s all done. The Patriots partner with Eastern Airlines for operating this plane meaning that Eastern provides the crews maintenance etc.

What do you make of the New England Patriots’ Boeing 767?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS8yMDIxLXRoZS1yZXN1cmdlbmNlLW9mLXRoZS1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021: The Resurgence Of The Boeing 737 MAX,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS8yMDIxLXRoZS1yZXN1cmdlbmNlLW9mLXRoZS1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8xNS90b3AtMTAtbW9zdC1wcm9kdWNlZC1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXR5cGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Most-Produced Commercial Aircraft Types - SamChui.com,"Here's a list of the top 10 most-produced commercial aircraft by type in history.

10. Antonov An-24/26

An-24: Total Deliveries: 1367 as of 1979

Production: 1959-1979

An-24 is a Russian/Ukrainian aircraft designed in 1957 in the Soviet Union by the Antonov Design Bureau. It's a 44 seater twin-turboprop aircraft that could be used for passenger and freighter flights. The type is manufactured by Kyiv Irkutsk and Ulan-Ude Aviation Factories. It took off to the skies for the first time in 1959. It was introduced in 1962 and is in active service. The type was built from 1959 to 1979 and 1367 An-24s have been built.

The type was flown by UTair Cargo Angara Airlines IrAero Yakutia Airlines Air Koryo and more.

In 2019 106 An-24s were flying but the number has dropped since. It was developed to replace the Ilyushin Il-14 which was used for short to medium-haul trips. Antonov An-24 could operate in rough airstrips and remote locations. Its high wing layout was beneficial in such situations as it prevented engines from dust and other ground materials. The aircraft was very versatile and could be used for a military rescue ice reconnaissance and more.

8. Boeing 747

Total Deliveries: 1569 as of December 2021

Production: 1968-present

The Boeing 747 is a long-range widebody aircraft developed by Boeing. Widely known as the Queen of the skies she took to the skies for the first time on February 9 1969 and the first 747 jumbo jet was delivered to Pan Am on January 22 1970.

Juan Trippe the president of Pan Am asked Boeing for an aircraft twice the size of 707. This is how the Jumbo jet was born. Pan Am took part in every step of the development and in April 1966 Pan Am ordered 25 Boeing 747-100 aircraft worth US$525 million at that time (equivalent to more than $3.2 billion today). The airliner became a sign of prestige and many airlines especially major carriers operated it.

The 747 remained very popular with many variants developed over five decades. There was even a tri-jet 747 concept that couldn't make it. The 747 freighter version is operated by almost all the major cargo airlines. These days however the 747 passenger jet isn't the aircraft of choice among airlines as fuel-efficient twinjets such as the B777 B787 A330 and A350 have taken over the long haul market.

7. Embraer E-Jet Family

Total Deliveries: 1596 as of March 2021

Production: 2001-present

The Embraer E-Jet family is a short to medium-range narrow-body twinjet manufactured by Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer. It can carry from 72 to 124 passengers. Launched at the Paris Air Show in 1999 the airliner entered into full production three years later in 2002. The airline can serve lower-demand routes offering the capacity and qualities of the larger jet.

The type first took off on February 19 2002. On March 17 2004 the first E-Jet was delivered to LOT Polish Airlines. A total of 1596 aircraft have been delivered so far and the type is still in service with airlines like Republic Airways SkyWest Airlines Envoy Air Mesa Airlines and JetBlue.

When the program was announced in 14 June 1999 Régional Compagnie Aérienne Européenne and Crossair were the launch costumers. In 2002 the type was displayed in the Regional Airline Association convention. Production began after a new factory in São José dos Campos base was built in 2002. In February 2004 type certification was received from the aviation authorities of Brazil Europe and the United States. On the second week of March 2004 the first aircraft was delivered. The family consists of E170 E175 E190 and E195 airliners.

6. Boeing 777

Total Deliveries: 1677 as of December 2021

Production: 1993-present

The Boeing 777 commonly known as triple seven is a long-range widebody aircraft developed by Boeing. It is the largest twinjet ever manufactured. The aircraft was introduced to fill the gap between Boeing 767 and 747 and replace older DC-10s and L-1011 tri-jets. Launched on October 14 1990 United Airlines became the launch customer.

The prototype rolled out on April 9 1994 and the aircraft completed its maiden flight on June 12 the same year. In a typical 3 class configuration the aircraft could accommodate up to 368 passengers. The type could fly from 9700 to 15843 km. On June 7 1995 the B777-200 started to fly with United.

In the late 1980s DC-10 and L-1011 were getting old and were to be retired soon. Airbus was working on A330 and A340 whereas McDonnell Douglas was working on the MD-11. Boeing considered stretching the 767 named 767-X. But airlines weren't interested in it. So Boeing went for a clean sheet design. Airlines were interested in the broader fuselage cross-section fully flexible interior configurations and short- to intercontinental-range capability. This resulted in the development of the Boeing 777 which opted for the twin-engine configuration.

Boeing also launched the ER and LR variants which provided flexibility to the whole program and the new 777X is now undergoing flight tests. Boeing also launched the freighter version 777F in May 2005. The first freighter 777 was delivered to Air France.

5. Boeing 727

Total Deliveries: 1832 as of 1984

Production: 1962-1984

The Boeing 727 is a narrow-body aircraft developed by Boeing in the early 1960s. After the development of 707 there was a need for smaller jets that could serve small airports. So the 727 was launched. The program had received orders for 40 aircraft each from United and Eastern Airlines at its launch. The plane took to the skies for the first time on February 9 1963. One year later the type entered service with Eastern Airlines on February 1 1964. The plane was produced for more than two decades and the last one rolled out in September 1984. Boeing built 1832 727 tri-jets.

Boeing 727 is the only trijet produced by Boeing. It is powered by Pratt & Whitney JT8D low-bypass turbofans and has a T-tail. All three engines are located at the back of the aircraft. The airline could carry around 106 passengers in two classes over 4170 km.

The stretched -200 variant entered the market in 1965 and first flew in July 1967. The same year it started to fly with Northeast Airlines in December. The 6.1 meters extended -200 variant could carry 134 passengers in two classes over 4720 km. The type was mainly used for domestic flights and some were used internationally. On January 13 2019 Boeing 727 operated its last commercial passenger flight between Zahedan and Tehran with Iran Aseman Airlines.

4. CRJ Series

Total Deliveries: 1945 as of December 2020

Production: 1991-2020

CRJ series(Canadair Regional Jet) is a regional jet series developed by Bombardier Aerospace. Launched with Lufthansa CityLine the aircraft completed its maiden flight on May 10 1991. The first generation (CRJ 100/200) was launched in 1991 and the second generation (CRJ700 series) was launched in 1999.

After the success of the challenger series Canadair launched the CRJ project with a primary goal to enter the market in the early 1990s and sell around 400 planes. The process was economical and development costs were less than other turboprop projects. Keeping in mind the success and customer request CRJ 200 was manufactured. Some minor changes were made new engines were added and the plane was more advanced.

The CRJ 200 completed its maiden flight in 1991. After the success of the CRJ 200 aircraft the stretched CRJ 700 was launched. The series was further extended to CRJ 900 which could accommodate more passengers. The airliner faced major competition from Embraer aircraft. E-Jet family was also taking over the market so CRJ 1000 was launched to compete with the type. Despite all these innovations the aircraft couldn't keep up with the new aircraft from Embraer and other manufacturers.

On June 1 2020 Japanese corporation Mitsubishi Heavy Industries took over the program after 1945 CRJ series aircraft were delivered by Bombardier. The CRJ series is very popular among regional airlines and is in active service with SkyWest Airlines Endeavor Air PSA Airlines and Air Wisconsin among others.

3. Airbus A320 Family

Total Deliveries: 10176 as of December 2021

Production: 1986-present

Launched in March 1984 the A320 family is a narrow-body family of jets developed by Airbus. The prototype flew three years later on February 22 1987. On April 18 1988 Airbus delivered its first A320 to Air France. 10176 A320 family aircraft have been delivered as of December 2021.

Some major A320 family aircraft operators are Indigo American Airlines China Eastern Airlines EasyJet China Southern Airlines etc. Like the 737 families the A320 family also has many members in its family which consist of Airbus A318 Airbus A319 Airbus A320 Airbus A321 and more advanced neo family jets.

After developing A300 and A310 Airbus started to look into the single-aisle narrow-body market mainly occupied by Boeing 737 and Douglas DC-9. The A320 family received orders for 96 aircraft when it was launched in 1984. Air France was the launch customer ordering 25 jets along with an option for additional 25 more aircraft.

After 1200 hours of test flight across 530 flights the airline was awarded European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) certification on February 26 1988. The base variant A320 was stretched more and the A321 was launched which is 6.94 meters (22 ft 9 in) longer than the A320. When A320 was shrunk a little a smaller A319 was born. When further shrunk the A318 was born. Airbus A318 was built to challenge Boeing 737 Classics but faced challenges from the next generation and MAX series aircraft. Airbus has been delivering more narrow-body jets than Boeing in recent years.

2. Boeing 737 Family

Total Deliveries: 10877 as of December 2021

Production: 1966-present

The Boeing 737 is a narrow-body aircraft manufactured by Boeing in Renton Factory Washington. It is the most produced aircraft in commercial aviation with 10877 planes delivered as of December 2021.

Boeing 737 took to the skies for the first time on April 9 1967 54 years ago and is very famous for medium-haul flights. Ten months later on February 10 1968 the first aircraft was delivered to Lufthansa. The 737 family is still a popular choice for airlines around the globe. It is flown by airlines like Southwest Airlines Ryanair United Airlines and American Airlines.

Boeing wanted to build an aircraft that could offer shorter routes something smaller than the Boeing 727. Aircraft of similar sizes like Douglas DC-9 and Fokker F28 were already manufactured and getting flight certification. Lufthansa was the launch customer with an order for 21 jets worth roughly around $67 million at that time. The first generation includes 737-100 and 737-200.

Boeing 737 Classic which is the second generation soon followed. They were more advanced than the previous generation with new engines. 737 Next Generation soon followed which is the third generation and most of the 737s flown today belong to this group including the models 737-600/700/800/900 series and the extended range -700ER/900ER variants.

Launched back in 2011 737 MAX is the latest and most advanced generation. The family includes MAX 737-7/8/9/10 as well as MAX8 200. The main rival/competitor of the 737 families is the Airbus A320 family.

[broadstreet zone=”51611″]

BOSTON – The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the real estate market in the U.S. in many ways changing where families want to live and the types of housing they prefer.

Early on in the pandemic many families in densely populated urban areas set out for more spacious homes in rural or suburban areas.

As more workplaces have adapted to permanent work-from-home or hybrid arrangements some workers have made the move permanent preferring space and affordability over proximity to the workplace or other amenities. And these pandemic-induced shifts have accelerated a trend away from cities among the Millennial generation.

At ages 25 to 40 Millennials are currently in their peak years for starting or growing a family and are seeking more spacious homes to accommodate that.

While as many as 89% of homebuyers would prefer a single-family home these trends run counter to the direction of housing development in recent years. Apartments multi-family construction and other denser forms of housing have been presented as more efficient affordable and sustainable options than single-family homes.

As a result the share of new housing units authorized by building permits that are single-family dropped from nearly 80% at the peak of the U.S. housing bubble in 2005 to less than 60% ten years later. Recently however that share has begun to recover rising from 62.2% to 66.6% from 2019 to 2020.

[broadstreet zone=”52093″]

Americans’ preference for single-family homes extends into the rental market as well. More than two-thirds of renters (67.1%) live in multi-family units compared to just 11.6% of owners. But during the pandemic demand for single-family rentals has increased as well which has pushed rents higher.

According to CoreLogic single-family rents rose 10.2% from September 2020 to September 2021 behind a surging demand for single-family properties especially from those who have been priced out of the hot residential real estate market.

But while adequate supply of single-family homes is a current challenge single-family units remain the norm in most places.

Only one state—New York—has a majority of its housing in the form of multi-family units with only 46.6% single-family units.

In contrast more than half of all states have 70% or more single-family units led by Indiana and Kansas at 78.5% apiece.

In general single-family homes tend to be more common in the Midwest and South and less common on the coasts. As a result most of the large cities (>350000 residents) with the most single-family homes are located in Midwestern and Southern states.

But somewhat surprisingly the large U.S. city with the greatest share of single-family homes is Bakersfield CA with 76.2% single-family units—well above the overall share for California 64.7% which ranks 43rd among states.

The data used in this analysis is from the U.S. Census Bureau. To determine the locations with the most single-family homes researchers at Construction Coverage calculated the percentage of existing housing units that are single-family defined as “single unit detached” or “single unit attached.” In the event of a tie the location with the higher percentage of owner-occupied housing units that are single-family was ranked higher. Researchers also included statistics on renter-occupied housing units.

The analysis found that 57.2% of Massachusetts housing units are single-family compared to 68.4% of all U.S. housing units.

Out of all U.S. states Massachusetts has the 2nd smallest percentage of housing units that are single-family.

Here is a summary of the data for Massachusetts:

Percentage of housing units that are single-family: 57.2%

57.2% Percentage of owner housing units that are single-family: 83.0%

83.0% Percentage of renter housing units that are single-family: 14.6%

14.6% Total single-family housing units: 1515125

1515125 Total housing units: 2650680

For reference here are the statistics for the entire United States:

Percentage of housing units that are single-family: 68.4%

68.4% Percentage of owner housing units that are single-family: 88.4%

88.4% Percentage of renter housing units that are single-family: 32.9%

32.9% Total single-family housing units: 84051726

84051726 Total housing units: 122802852

A man cross country skiing at the Notchview Reservation in Windsor Massachusetts. Trustees of Reservations

As another winter gets underway amid spiking virus cases many are again turning to recreation areas where they can spend time outdoors safely and still socialize with family and friends.

And last week’s snowstorm is helping out a lot.

At Ski Bradford a small ski hill in Haverhill skiers are returning quickly following last week’s snow and the recent cold temperatures that allowed the staff to operate the snowmaking machines.

“We’ve expanded our hours back to normal” said Dennis Gauvin the ski patrol director. Last winter the hill operated on a shortened schedule and saw fewer visitors and after-school program participants due to COVID restrictions.

“Our after-school program has gone back up” Gauvin said. Lessons for first-time skiers are also booking up quickly he added.

Visitors come to Bradford from all across the North Shore South Shore and Cape Ann as well as from throughout the Merrimack Valley and Southern New Hampshire.

Face coverings are strongly encouraged inside the ski lodge Gauvin said.

With the cold’s arrival business is also bustling at Nashoba Valley Ski Area and Snowtubing Park according to president Al Fletcher after a mild start to the season.

“There’s definitely a lot of interest” he said. “It’s getting back towards normal.”

Last winter the ski area halted its school and recreation programs among other COVID restrictions which was a big loss Fletcher said. This year those groups are back as well as local schools’ ski racing.

On the tubing hill interest has stayed consistently high Fletcher continued. With no need to buy special equipment or have any certain skill set the activity appeals to all and can be a spur-of-the-moment decision.

As winter returns visitors are also setting out to the 123 Trustees of Reservation properties around the state where they can socialize safely and get some fresh air.

Aaron Gouveia public relations director for the Trustees said the ongoing pandemic has led the land preservation and conservation nonprofit to implement some innovative new ideas.

“The omicron variant means COVID is still very much a concern for people which is why we’ve come up with some innovative programming that lets people gather outdoors in a safer environment while remaining active” he wrote in an email. “It’s always important to get people out and active during the winter but perhaps never more so than the last two we’ve experienced.”

“We just released a brand new downloadable map that acts as a checklist so people can check off our properties as they visit them” Gouveia added. “This was a special request from our Hike Trustees group which consisted of more than 1100 people who visited 119 of our sites on 12000 individual hikes totaling more than 35100 miles in 2021.”

The popular fire pit rentals will return this year as well Gouveia said.

“We started these last winter and they were so immensely popular we not only brought them back but expanded them” he wrote.

Visitors to nearly a dozen of the Trustee properties can rent a fire pit to enjoy after a hike on the trails. Staff will start the fire and s’mores and seats are provided.

Properties with fire pits include Appleton Farms (Ipswich); Notchview (Windsor); Long Hill (Beverly); Fruitlands Museum (Harvard); Bradley Estate (Canton); Stevens-Coolidge House & Gardens (North Andover); Old Manse (Concord); Chestnut Hill Farm (Southborough) and Castle Hill (Ipswich).

And now that we have snow visitors can once again go snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.

“Notchview is definitely our most popular spot for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing as we have more than 25 miles of trails” Gouveia said.

Last winter was record-setting for the Trustees he added as the number of estimated visitors doubled. In 2021 Trustees sold 1300 season passes and 300 youth season passes which were new last year.

“We are already trending above that number for season passes for adults and kids and we’re seeing significant increases in people coming from farther away (New York Boston etc.)” Gouveia added.

While the majority of Trustee properties are free based on those that do require sales and staff estimates it’s estimated more than 2 million people visited the properties in 2021.",,,,,,,,,

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vbmV3cy82MDk1MjYvYnJvd24tdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1hbnRpc2VtaXRpc20tcHJvdGVzdHMtZW5jYW1wbWVudC_SAVhodHRwczovL2ZvcndhcmQuY29tL25ld3MvNjA5NTI2L2Jyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktYW50aXNlbWl0aXNtLXByb3Rlc3RzLWVuY2FtcG1lbnQvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Everyone gets to be uncomfortable’: How Jewish students at Brown kept antisemitism at bay,"By Mira Fox May 3 2024

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmN5anVuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvNi8yNDE1MDcxOC9iZW5nYWxzLXRyZXktcGF0cmlvdHMtZ20tcmVxdWVzdC1uZmzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bengals' Trey Brown turns down Patriots' GM request per report,"It appears the Cincinnati Bengals will keep Trey Brown in the team’s front office for at least one more season.

Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbmVzbi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS93aGF0LW1hY2stYnJvd24tdG9sZC1wYXRyaW90cy1icmFzcy1kdXJpbmctcHJlLWRyYWZ0LWRyYWtlLW1heWUtY2hhdC_SAWJodHRwczovL25lc24uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvd2hhdC1tYWNrLWJyb3duLXRvbGQtcGF0cmlvdHMtYnJhc3MtZHVyaW5nLXByZS1kcmFmdC1kcmFrZS1tYXllLWNoYXQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Mack Brown Told Patriots During Pre-Draft Drake Maye Chat,"Less than an hour after the New England Patriots selected Drake Maye with the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft de facto general manager Eliot Wolf and first-year head coach Jerod Mayo expressed confidence in Maye because they got to know him as both a football player and person.

The Patriots met with Maye on multiple occasions including a trip to North Carolina for the Tar Heels Pro Day. During that trip Mayo and company spoke with longtime and well-respected coach Mack Brown. Mayo specifically said he received a “glowing recommendation” from the Tar Heels head coach and noted how that conversation eased any nerves about drafting Maye.

Brown a 46-year coaching veteran met with a handful of New England reporters on a video conference Monday and relayed what he told Mayo and company during the pre-draft process.

“I’ve learned that I want the high school coach to tell me the truth in recruiting so I’m very honest with the NFL coaches” Brown said. “This is important to them.

“So with Coach Mayo I knew this is huge for him just starting out in this first year. So I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye. We all put our checks in the mouth of players and that’s what you’re (Mayo) gonna do. And I would rather have Drake Maye than anybody in the country leading my football team.’

I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye.’ Mack Brown on conversations with Jerod Mayo

Brown’s recommendation to Mayo was echoed throughout the pre-draft process and again Monday. Brown praised Maye for his toughness competitiveness and ability to lead a rocker room with his mix of positive reinforcement and constructive criticism.

Brown even spoke to the Maye athletic and authentic family along with the quarterback’s longtime girlfriend. Maye introduced his three brothers and girlfriend to reporters during his introductory press conference at Gillette Stadium.

“He’s an unbelievable person” Brown said. “He’s one of the nicest toughest most competitive young people I’ve ever been around. I’ve said often I would adopt him. He’s that perfect of a kid. It sounds kind of corny but it’s true.”

Brown also relayed a story as to how Maye included other position groups whenever he was approached with an NIL deal. It was one of the many ways Maye proved his worth as a teammate.

“So if they came and said ‘We want you to do this advertisement.’ He said ‘Well the offensive linemen need to be with me and they need to be paid.’ Or ‘Well we want you to get fed through the seafood company for the year.’ And he said ‘That’s great the receivers and their families need to get fed too.'”

But Brown made it clear to New England’s organization the competitor they were getting too.

“He is not coming to Boston to lose” Brown said.

It seems that message was heard loud and clear throughout the Patriots organization."

They also warned that greenwashing poses one of the biggest threats to consumer trust and that the marcomms industry is at a “tipping point”.

Earlier this week Smith said Unilever had “lost the plot” over its focus on sustainability after a relatively poor performance over the past couple of years – including a 9% drop in share value in the past 12 months.

His company Fundsmith Equity Fund owns in the region of £888m of Unilever stock which was one of its bottom five performers a list that also included PayPal and Brown-Forman.

Unilever is one of the world’s biggest advertisers with a £6bn annual spend on brand and marketing investment and Smith singled out purpose marketing activities for mayonnaise brand Hellmann’s and ice cream Ben & Jerry’s as examples of how the company had taken its eye off the ball.

But the numbers suggest otherwise. In 2018 prior to the pandemic Unilever’s 28 Sustainable Living Brands which include both Hellmann's and Ben & Jerry’s grew 69% faster than the rest of its business and accounted for 75% of the FMCG giant’s overall growth.

During the pandemic various lockdowns have affected Unilever’s brands unevenly leading to flat turnover and marginal declines in 2020.

“We're going to see more and more people emerge from the woodwork claiming that the reason why that fund is failing or their business is having a problem is because they focus too much on sustainability"" according to John Brown founder and chief executive of Don’t Cry Wolf a creative communications agency that helps brands with sustainability and brand activism communications.

""[Smith] is using sustainability as a stick with which to beat any form of underperformance away and our job is to laugh off this stupidity and ignorance in the highest sense.

“I think it's quite telling that after this rant his position on Unilever still hasn't changed. What we're going to see happen this year in particular is that more people will use sustainability as a broom to sweep underperformance away.”

Brown told Campaign there is a far more positive story about Unilever’s activities over the past couple of years.

“Despite Covid and despite the fact that Unilever was almost certainly going to suffer quite significant issues for its sub brands it still maintains its ethical and sustainable position” he said. “I think that should be applauded rather than criticised.”

There are other reasons that large listed companies need to focus on sustainability and purpose: it is what an increasing number of consumers and investors now demand.

Sue Garrard is one of the UK’s leading sustainability strategy advisors who for many years led Unilever's sustainable business development and communications.

Although she did not wish to comment directly on the criticism of her former employer she said there are clear headwinds.

“The investor market is moving a million miles an hour away from stocks that look like they have not assessed their climate risks towards ones that have” she said.

“The former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said at COP26 that about $130tn worth of assets under management – that’s 40% of all the assets under management in the whole world – have all committed that their future investments will be only ones that will contribute to the fight against climate change.”

There is also plenty of evidence according to Brown and Garrard that younger consumers are far more likely to buy products and services from brands and organisations that have an ethical footprint.

So what does this mean for marketing and advertising?

Garrard said the industry has a fundamental role in helping brands communicate how consumers can behave in a more sustainable and ethical fashion and the stakes could not be higher.

“The biggest risks that brands face is actually overplaying greenwash and undermining consumer trust"" she added. ""The really worrying thing is if it happens too much it risks undermining consumer confidence in brands and communication in general.

""While we're all trying to respond to this existential threat of carbon emissions going through the roof greenwashing can undermine the task of trying to fix that problem and trying to direct consumers to do things that are responsible.

“So I think we're at an incredibly delicate moment in marketing and advertising history and brands that behave irresponsibly by not backing up claims of activity or misleading people with greenwashing will ultimately get found out and pay the price.”

For advertising media and communications agencies this means taking a more courageous role in pushing back against client briefs that appear to be greenwashing or other dubious forms of purpose-led activity.

It’s a position that might find sympathy with Droga5 chief creative officer David Kolbusz who recently told delagates at a Campaign Breakfast Briefing that purpose-led advertising was a pet peeve.

Brown said this doesn’t mean brands and their agency partners should avoid purpose and sustainability it just means it needs to be authentic.

“The industry has to now decide are we going to – for the sake of profits – continue down a path of fairly meaningless intent-based campaigns that if you scratch beneath the surface there's not much there or can we sacrifice a little bit of the profit margin but commit to a position that we will not put forward a campaign without the necessary evidence and authenticity that is required?” he said.

“It's too dangerous for us to blindly walk into the creation and dissemination of information and content to creative out there without pausing for breath for a moment the same need to understand what the evidence is backing this up.

“Are we going to be part of the problem or are we going to be part of the solution?”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The singer received treatment for ""severe and persistent muscle spasms"" that previously prevented her from singing and she is still recovering according to the Saturday announcement. The North American leg of her tour was originally postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic but is now canceled.

""I was really hoping that I’d be good to go by now but I suppose I just have to be more patient and follow the regimen that my doctors are prescribing"" Dion said in a statement. ""I’ll be so glad to get back to full health as well as all of us getting past this pandemic and I can’t wait to be back on stage again.""

Dion is expected to begin the Europe leg of the ""Courage"" tour in May.

In October the French-Canadian chanteuse postponed her Las Vegas residency due to the muscle spasms she said were preventing her from rehearsals.

View the current offers here.

Maybe you can teach an old dog new tricks. I've enjoyed collecting miles and points for over two decades. In that time I'm pretty sure I can safely say I've never booked a hotel room through an online travel agency with the goal of earning points. Frankly I can only recall a single instance or two where I've even booked a hotel room via any method other than directly with a hotel chain. Until now.

Booking a hotel through the Capital One travel portal

The new Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card has a headline benefit that advertises 10 miles per dollar for hotel bookings through Capital One Travel. That sounds great on paper but I was curious if it would really be that easy. I signed up for the Capital One Venture X card late last year for the incredible sign-up bonus but I also had another plan in mind. If I really could easily earn 10 miles per dollar on hotel bookings for me and my employees I might be able to spin that into a dream Star Wars adventure for our son at Disney World. Since these adventures can easily top $5000 it just wasn't something I was willing to pay for out of pocket (unlike my friend Benet).

Booking a room through the Capital One Travel portal was easy. The thing that was even more surprising to me was that for some dates I searched it was even cheaper than booking with Marriott directly. In this example it was $197.75 to book with Marriott directly:

Room price quote. (Screenshot courtesy Marriott)

And yet only $195.10 through Capital One Travel:

Room price quote. (Screenshot courtesy Capital One Travel)

This wasn't the case in every example. But by and large Capital One Travel was within a few dollars of Marriott's website on the handful of dates I searched.

In situations like this it's important to note you'd be foregoing any elite benefits you might otherwise enjoy by booking directly with Marriott. As a small business owner this was actually a hotel booking for an employee with no elite status at a property where elite benefits don't get you much anyway. For the 2-week booking my total was $2723.35. My confirmation from Capital One noted I would earn 27234 Capital One miles. Sure enough on the day of check-in my Capital One account was credited with 27234 miles (they even rounded up)!

How does this compare to booking direct?

Your personal earning preference will vary but I wanted to take a look at a few examples of how these 27234 miles stack up against booking directly with Marriott. It's worth noting Capital One awarded me 10 miles per dollar on the entire price of the stay not just the base room rate. Generally speaking Marriott isn't going to award points on taxes or fees (including resort fees). In this case we're going to use a base rate of about $2360 to calculate Marriott earning amounts.

Marriott awards five points per dollar on stays at Residence Inns. However most other brands earn 10 points per dollar so your math will vary based on the Marriott brand you stay with.

In this case I would have earned 11800 Marriott Bonvoy points assuming no elite status or other bonuses with Marriott. TPG's value for Bonvoy points is 0.8 cents versus 1.4 cents for Capital One miles. That means the Bonvoy points are worth ~$94 whereas the Capital One miles are worth $381. That's a big difference!

Elite status will also play a big factor in how many Bonvoy points you can earn. For example as a Titanium Elite member I would earn a 75% bonus or another 8850 points. If you're thinking about transferring your points or miles to an airline it's also important to note that Marriott transfers at a 3:1 ratio (with a 5000-mile bonus for transfers of 60000 points) whereas virtually all Capital One transfers are at 1:1.

Using Air Canada Aeroplan as an example (since both programs share the airline as a partner) you would net 6666 Aeroplan miles if you transferred 20000 Marriott Bonvoy points.

If instead you choose to transfer 20000 Capital One miles you would net over 3 times more Aeroplan miles for 20000 in total. When you combine 1:1 transfer partners with 10X on hotel bookings through Capital One travel the value can be much higher than booking with a hotel chain directly. Capital One has done a really fantastic job of increasing the number of airline and hotel partners you can transfer to.

And you can always use your Capital One miles to burn down future travel purchases.

Bottom line

(Photo courtesy of Marriott)

My next test will be booking rental cars through the Capital One Travel portal. I'm eager to see if it's as easy to earn 10X miles for rental cars as it was for hotels. Admittedly this is a sample size of one hotel booking but I'm impressed. The Capital One Travel portal was easy to navigate and the miles posted much quicker than I would have expected. Because I have lifetime Titanium Elite status I don't need elite night credit making it easier to be a free agent and book through an online travel agency.

As a small business owner I've never really put much thought into booking through an online travel agency. I valued the perks the hotel chains were willing to offer me when I booked directly. But this new card changes the math.

For employee bookings the value of 10 miles per dollar through Capital One Travel is easy for me to see. The ease of booking and the quick posting of Capital One miles make me very likely to book this way for myself in the future as well.

There are definitely hotel stays where I'll want to take advantage of benefits like a late check-out or free breakfast. For everything else I'll take 10 Capital One miles for every dollar I spend versus fewer Marriott Bonvoy points on a portion of my total bill.

View the current offers here.

Etihad is one of the three major Gulf carriers in the Middle East alongside Emirates and Qatar. These airlines are among the most luxurious in the world — notably better than U.S. airlines whether you're flying coach or first class.

Etihad is well-known for its fantastic First Class Apartment seat as well as its over-the-top ""Residence"" which is effectively a full hotel room in the sky. These seats appear exclusively on Etihad's A380 planes which have unfortunately been grounded due to financial constraints in the wake of coronavirus. Etihad may blow the dust off of these planes in 2022 but even if we never see these seats again Etihad still offers some of the most luxurious seats in the sky.

The problem is that award flights on Etihad are not cheap when using Etihad Guest miles. Fortunately Etihad partners with Air Canada Aeroplan making possible some pretty spectacular deals. You can redeem your Aeroplan points to book the exact same Etihad seats at a steep discount. Aeroplan points are easy to earn too as they partner with the following transferable points currencies:

Many of the best travel credit cards earn these types of points so you might already have a stash waiting to be used for luxurious Etihad seats. Here's what you need to know to book Etihad with Aeroplan points.

If you want to fly on Etihad booking through Air Canada can yield savings of tens of thousands of points. For example Etihad charges 120000 points for a business class flight between Washington DC (IAD) and Abu Dhabi (AUH).

But Air Canada charges 85000 points for the exact same seat. For anyone that doesn't have a calculator handy that's a 35000-point savings by using Aeroplan points instead of Etihad miles.

If you haven't read our quick guide to adding a stopover with Aeroplan check it out. This could immensely increase the value of your Etihad award flight as well. Air Canada allows you to add one stopover per one-way flight (or two stopovers per round-trip) for 5000 Aeroplan points each. Booking a flight from the U.S. to Australia with a stopover in Abu Dhabi for example could save you 100000+ points.

How to book this award

Let's search for a flight between New York (JFK) and Abu Dhabi (AUH). Nearly all Etihad flights connect in its hub in the United Arab Emirates — so even if your destination isn't Abu Dhabi you'll probably be searching for flights to there anyway.

Step 1. Search the Etihad website for available seats

This step is not a requirement but it can save you both time and frustration.

The Air Canada website occasionally will show available award seats when there in fact are none. Instead of beginning your search on Air Canada head to the Etihad website for more reliable award inventory.

Step 2. Sort by cabin

If you'd prefer to fly business or first class specify your choice cabin in your search. Etihad displays a calendar week of award prices at the top of your search results and filtering by cabin will help you to scan dates more easily for your desired seat.

Step 3. Find ""GuestSeat"" inventory

As you can see the below business class seat from New York to Abu Dhabi has three different prices:

100333 miles (plus taxes) in GuestSeat Business

622625 miles (plus taxes) in Choice

1015500 miles (plus taxes) in Choice Plus

Any flight that offers ""GuestSeat"" award availability can also be booked through Air Canada.

If you're perusing the Etihad award calendar and see a date selling seats from 600000+ miles you can assume there are no GuestSeat Business awards available that day.

Step 4. Head to the Air Canada website to book

Once you find a date that works for you navigate to the Air Canada website and search for your flight there. You'll find the exact same seat for considerably fewer points.

Here is the same business class seat on Air Canada for 85000 points. That's a savings of more than 15000 points — not to mention $150 fewer taxes and fees!

Bottom line

Etihad premium seats are something of a bucket list item in the points and miles community. But if you want to book them don't use Etihad miles. You can reserve the exact same seat through Air Canada and save tens of thousands of points. Plus you can add a stopover for just 5000 miles each way. And the ease with which you can earn Aeroplan points makes this deal even sweeter.

The dealership stock is estimated at about 400000 vehicles that are mainly GM products but include other brands. In addition there are about 500000 GM vehicles from GM’s lease and finance arm GM Financial.

The move comes at the same time as GM has moved to get agreement from US buyers leasing its cars that they will not sell their vehicle at the end of the lease to other than to a GM dealership.

This ensures that GM and its dealers will get an increasing grip on the used car market because the vehicles must be returned to a GM dealership and onto the CarBravo site.

GM said the strength of the offering is that it has 4200 dealerships with a huge stock.

The online used-vehicle platform will go head-to-head with the major US retailers Carvana Fair and CarMax.

GM picked the timing to coincide with soaring used-car prices built on unprecedented demand that has been triggered by low new-car production caused by the semiconductor shortage and the ongoing effects of COVID-19 that encourage personal travel.

The average used-car price in the US is now $US27500 ($A38160) up 35 per cent since January 2021.

In a recent statement GM said the CarBravo site will aggregate vehicles owned by Buick Chevrolet and GMC dealers in addition to those held by GM Financial after completing leases with fleets and rental car agencies.

GM has been watching the success of its independent non-dealer rivals. Carvana which has a market value of $US34 billion ($A47b) reported a 74 per cent increase in sales in the 12 months to the end of 2021. It sold 111949 used vehicles in the third quarter of 2021.

About 40 million used vehicles are sold each year in the US more than twice that of new cars and trucks.

OEMs have not been involved in this market – until now. Access to the used-vehicle market and its customers would give GM access to a huge database of potential new-vehicle buyers as well as customers for its services such as its radio subscription service SiriusXM.

CarBravo which starts in the first half of this year allows customers to shop online or through a GM dealership and with access to listed vehicles across the country. They can buy online or in person or a combination of both and some dealers will have test drives and home deliveries.

The site will use Black Book part of Hearst Media and a valuation source since 1955 to value vehicles for sale and also those for trade.

CarBravo will also source used vehicles directly from the public.

GM will offer CarBravo buyers “standard warranty cover” and trial subscriptions to OnStar and SiriusXM for some vehicles.

It will also give customers access to GM Financial’s services and the nationwide GM network of service and maintenance facilities.

GM has already assured itself of some success. In July 2021 it enforced a rule to leaseholders that the vehicle could not be sold outside of a GM dealership.

This ensures vehicles will return to the GM dealership and onto the CarBravo site.

In a statement GM’s head of North American operations Steve Carlisle said CarBravo could outsell Carvana because of the supply of vehicles controlled by GM and its dealers.

“CarBravo will give customers more choice and access to shop significantly expanded inventories of both the dealer and a national central stock of GM used vehicles” he said.

They were crowned during a coronation ceremony Saturday evening in downtown Whitefish.

Geoffrey was born in Great Falls Montana the last of nine children. His parents started and operated a potato chip and french fry company Big Stack Chip and Foods for 24 years.

He spent his winters skiing King’s Hill and summers at the family cabin on Lake Blaine. The roller skating rink at Lake Blaine was always a summer highlight. His parents retired and moved to Boise Idaho where Geoff graduated High School. He then went on to study at Colorado State University and University of Utah majoring in skiing while managing to get a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Chemistry. He went on to receive his doctor of optometry degree at the University of Houston College of Optometry.

After an internship in London England he entered an amazing practice with the Berkley Eye Clinic in Houston. The clinic was involved in multiple FDA therapeutic and surgical studies and was one of the first FDA sites for LASIK refractive surgery. He served on the Texas Optometric Association and Harris County Optometric Boards and was an Adjunct Professor of Optometry at the University of Houston College of Optometry. He was a proud member of the Society to Prevent Blindness as well. He practiced for 21 years but after numerous back surgeries he and his wife Lisa decided it was time to return home. Whitefish was the perfect place to raise their two boys Ian and Aidan. In the summer of 2007 they packed up a moving truck and drove to Whitefish where the summer heat that year set an all-time high.

Even in a back brace Geoff found his second calling in volunteer coaching. Soccer Little Dribblers basketball baseball and even Little Guy Football after reading Football for Dummies first. He taught the boys the beauty of Nordic and alpine skiing leading to a decade of ski racing all over Montana and even Alaska. He served for many years as a board member of the following amazing nonprofits; the Flathead Valley Ski Education Foundation promoting youth ski racing in the valley Flathead Rapids as well as the Knights of Columbus at St. Charles Borromeo. He is currently serving on the Alpine Theater Project board and continues his proud association with the Knights of Columbus and all of the charitable activities they are associated with.

Geoff uses his past optometric skills as a member of the Lions Club of Whitefish and has been doing the school vision screenings with the help of the Lion’s Club generous donation of the two high tech Plus Optik vision screeners and multiple worthy volunteers!!

He loves all things outdoors and chose to live in Whitefish because of the close proximity to the ski hill where he would spend every second of the winter season if he could. In the summertime he loves spending time on Whitefish Lake and Glacier Park.

Geoff says he is very excited and humbled to be asked to be King Ullr LXIII and is looking forward to representing Whitefish.



Lisa was born and raised in Salt Lake City Utah. She graduated from the University of Utah and moved to Los Angeles where she worked for SkyWest Airlines. While in Los Angeles she was hired with United Airlines as a flight attendant and was based in London England for 6 and a half years. While in London Lisa met Geoff Calaway and promptly moved to Houston Texas where Geoff was practicing optometry. Fifteen years and two amazing boys later Geoff and Lisa wanted to return to their roots in the west and decided upon Whitefish. In Whitefish they found the village they were looking for to raise their boys. Ian was 5 and Aidan was 3 when they arrived here in June of 2007. Happy to leave the big cities behind and jump into getting to know their chosen happy place.

Lisa became a member of the St. Charles Borromeo choir and taught the kindergarten class there for years until she was asked to join the Whitefish PTA. The PTA has since turned into the Family Involvement Team(FIT) and has joined with the Whitefish Education Foundation where Lisa serves as the chairperson for the FIT. She loves teaching the Arts with the Masters classes at Muldown Elementary and she and her husband have become regulars in helping with the Lions club eye testing at all the Whitefish schools. She has served on the HOA board for the Grouse Mountain homeowners and currently serves on the board of ATP. She has worked at the Village shop for over 10 years and owns her own property management business and loves volunteering at the Whitefish Theater Company box office and helping with Feat x Feet where her boys have loved being a part of the tap-dancing ensemble.

Taking full advantage of all Whitefish has to offer Lisa loves boating on Whitefish Lake golfing Nordic and downhill skiing hiking in Glacier Park and scrapbooking. She loves her book club and her Friday morning breakfast club.

Lisa says she is so excited to be a part of the tradition of the Whitefish Winter Carnival and very humbled to be asked to carry on such an amazing tradition.

The cruise ship starts operations from Charleston today January 13 with the first guests welcomed onboard in true Carnival style.

Carnival Sunshine is the first ship to homeport in Charleston South Carolina since the global pause in operations almost two years ago. Guests will be able to enjoy a wide range of Bahamas cruises as well as longer Caribbean cruises.

Carnival Sunshine Sails From Charleston

Carnival Sunshine now sails from Charleston South Carolina on the first cruise from her homeport. The vessel has been operating some cruises from Miami and Fort Lauderdale in December and January to replace Carnival Horizon. That vessel was forced to go into a dry dock due to mechanical issues which impacted her maximum cruising speed.

Sunshine will depart Charleston on a 4-night Bahamas cruise sailing to Nassau. Guests will have a day to enjoy at sea after departure and on the way back to Charleston.

“We have been sailing from Charleston for 12 years so we are excited to be back offering guests from all over the southeastern U.S. the opportunity to cruise from this beautiful historic and charming community all while providing support to the local economy” said Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line.

As can be seen on Carnival Ambassador John Heald’s Facebook page guests were welcomed in true Carnival style in Charleston. The 102853-gross ton cruise ship has space for 3002 passengers but this sailing will only carry 2097 guests.

Carnival Sunshine will sail on her second cruise from Charleston on January 17. This voyage one of the Carnival Journeys offers guests even more choice with itineraries and experiences that you would not usually find on a regular Carnival cruise.

The 10-day voyage will sail to St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin islands first followed by calls to Philipsburg St. Maarten St. John’s in Antigua Roast Town in Tortola and Amber Cove Dominican Republic after which the vessel will make her way back to Charleston during two days at sea.

Charleston has always been a popular homeport for Carnival Cruise Line. The city is easy to reach by air car or public transport and is a fantastic destination to spend a few days and soak up the southern hospitality.

Safety First for Charleston Port

According to the South Carolina ports authority guests can rest assured that they will find the cruise terminal fully prepared to deal with the thousands of guests who will pass through during embarkation days.

Liz Crumley with the South Carolina Ports Authority said in a statement: “Following a long-term pause in cruise operations since March 2020 in response to the global pandemic SC Ports has worked with cruise partners and DHEC to align with all CDC requirements and cruise line protocols as cruise operations resume”

When a ship is in the port a team of people will disinfect high-touch areas constantly including handrails doorknobs and other surfaces. Face masks will be mandatory inside the terminal and onboard the vessel at all times.

All guests will be required to be fully vaccinated at least 14 days before sailing except if they received a vaccine exemption from Carnival Cruise Line in advance. The cruise line has also implemented extensive health and safety measures such as social distancing increased sanitation mask-wearing policies and more.

Now in 2022 there is a possibility to make up for the festivals that had to be postponed or cancelled in last year’s Carnival season in Hungary.

Carnival season

In Hungary Carnival season or as we call it the “farsangi időszak” is a traditional Christian-Hungarian holiday all about balls feasts merriment and masked or costume parties.

It starts on January 6th a.k.a. the Epiphany and ends the day before Ash Wednesday. Traditionally Ash Wednesday is the start of the 40-day fast called Lent preceding Easter Sunday says Nevezetesnapok.

Although the start of the Carnival season is always on the day of Epiphany the endpoint of the celebrations is a moving holiday. In 2022 the Carnival season ends on March 2nd.

Busojárás is one of the most iconic holidays in Hungary related to this season of merriment. It is a six-day carnival marking and celebrating the end of winter. It attracts great crowds to Mohács and the surrounding area.

Busojárás has been a part of UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity since 2009 and has been a Hungarikum since 2012.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Boeing has announced a deal to build a new factory in St. Louis to build the MQ-25A Stingray drones. The facility set to be finished in 2024 will first employ 150 mechanics and support staff.

The word “drone” means many different things to different people. The small flying toys that one plays with are drones. So are the Predator drones that are used in foreign airstrikes.

Now the military has another use for drones: refueling strike fighters.

According to Popular Mechanics history was made earlier this month when the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25A Stingray refueling tanker conducted the first successful refueling of an F-35C strike fighter. The refueling took place near the MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah Illinois.

“The successful test is the latest step in giving carrier-based fighters longer legs than ever before allowing them to fly and fight while keeping the aircraft carrier safely out of range of enemy weapons” Popular Mechanics said of the maneuver.

Another report by Janes laid out exactly how it happened.

“During the three-hour flight a USN F-35C pilot from Air Test Wing and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23) approached the Boeing-owned test asset Stingray MQ-25 T1 and performed formation evaluations wake surveys and drogue tracking. It then plugged with the T1 at 225 kt calibrated airspeed at 10000 ft altitude.” There were two contacts with the actual transfer taking place during the second one.

Meanwhile per Flight Global Boeing has announced a deal to build a new factory located at that same airport to build the MQ-25A Stingray drones. The facility set to be finished in 2024 will first employ 150 mechanics and support staff.

“The team and state-of-the-art technology we’re bringing to the navy’s MQ-25 programme is unprecedented and we’re incredibly proud to be expanding both as we build the future of autonomous systems in Illinois” Kristin Robertson vice-president and general manager of Autonomous Systems Boeing Defense Space & Security said in a statement.

As I wrote last year about how the MQ-24A Stringray was “one step closer to reality” following the first successful test. It was seen at the time as “intended to take over the role of aerial refueling for the Navy a role currently filled by the Navy’s F/A-18 Super Hornets-turned tankers” we wrote of the MQ-24A.

“To see T1 [Stingray prototype] fly with the hardware and software that makes MQ-25 an aerial refueler this early in the program is a visible reminder of the capability we’re bringing to the carrier deck” Dave Bujold the MQ-25A Stingray program director said in a statement after that test. “We’re ensuring the ARS and the software operating it will be ready to help MQ-25 extend the range of the carrier air wing.”

There are two endemic butterflies including an iconic species designated as the state insect that could use some help even if it’s simply people being more aware of them.

“Considering the abundance of monarchs across Hawaiʻi it would be better if people planted Native Hawaiian plants to help our two native butterflies the Hawaiian blue and the Kamehameha butterfly” Daniel Rubinoff a professor of entomology at the University of Hawai‘i-Mānoa who works on insect conservation evolution and invasive species told Big Island Now.

The Kamehameha butterfly the Hawai‘i state insect and Hawaiian blue butterfly are the only butterfly species that are native to the islands according to William Haines a research entomologist with the state Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of Forestry and wildlife.

“We have over 5000 species of endemic insects or arthropods” said Haines who manages a captive rearing facility focused on raising rare and endangered insects in an attempt to establish new populations. “We have a ton of native insects but only two of those are butterflies.”

That might seem a little unusual but the circumstances behind how butterflies get to the islands and then stay provide an explanation.

“The thought of why we have so few native butterflies that established here was because butterflies tend to be very host specific so their caterpillars can usually only eat on one or a few different kinds of plants” Haines said. “So not only did they have to make this incredible journey over the Pacific Ocean and somehow find the Hawaiian Islands but their host plant also had to already be here for them to establish.”

Host plants play a huge role in how well the populations of the two butterflies fare. So when those plants are threatened by predators and pests especially those that are invasive so too are the caterpillars that eventually become butterflies. While adult butterflies can feed on the nectar of flowers and tree sap their caterpillars need specific host plants to survive.

That’s exactly what is happening to the Kamehameha and Hawaiian blue butterflies.

Both butterflies can be found on Hawai‘i Island Maui Moloka‘i Lana‘i O‘ahu and Kaua‘i. The Hawaiian blue butterfly also can be found on Kaho‘olawe but the island’s dry conditions are not suitable for the Kamehameha butterfly’s host plants and therefore it is not found there.

“Historically both butterfly species occurred at low and high elevations but nowadays they tend to be more abundant in upland areas since lowland areas not only have more invasive plants but also are infested with invasive predators such as ants” Haines said adding that ants are not native to Hawai‘i and the islands now have more than 60 established species of nonnative ants.

Yellowjacket wasps are another invasive species that can be devastating to caterpillars.

The Kamehameha butterfly Vanessa tameamea has several host plants all native plants in the nettle family. The most common is mamaki. Most of these grow in wet areas such as gulches and forest understories.

The Hawaiian blue Udara blackburni is a little more flexible according to Haines; however the insect is still only able to use a few host plants chiefly koa and a shrub called ‘a‘ali‘i. It’s also possible caterpillars can use nonnative acacia trees to some degree. ‘A‘ali‘i and koa occur in a wide range of habitats from dry to wet meaning the Hawaiian blue is somewhat more widespread than the Kamehameha butterfly.

While human development and agriculture destroyed a lot of native forests throughout the islands and thus host plants for the two butterfly species the threats to the food supply for their caterpillars now are primarily invasive plants.

“They are encroaching on native forest and very difficult to control” Haines said.

There also is the constant threat of introduced diseases and pathogens.

“Just like rapid ‘ohi‘a death is caused by an introduced pathogen fungi have been accidentally introduced that affect mamaki and other butterfly host plants” Haines said. “With importation of plants produce soil etc. there is always the threat of importing something new that could devastate one of our native plants.”

Host plants also determine the range of each of the butterfly species.

Because insect populations can fluctuate wildly during a matter of months often having “boom and bust” dynamics because of their short lifespans and high reproductive rates Haines said rather than population sizes scientists generally look at the distribution of the species and whether its overall range is shrinking or remaining stable.

The Hawaiian blue and Kamehameha butterflies are both being pushed to higher elevations because of invasive species. And while both species are declining because of the reasons already mentioned for the state insect which isn’t as widespread as the Hawaiian blue the situation seems to be more dire.

“For the Kamehameha butterfly although it is not endangered its range is definitely declining” he said. “Although it can still be reliably found in some parts of its range it has disappeared from many. Generally speaking its range has been pushed up to higher elevations and into the backs of valleys.”

But even in those areas where the butterfly still occurs Haines said residents say the butterfly has become rarer through the years.

“At lower elevations there’s just not as much habitat not as much viable habitat” Haines said. “Even if you were to plant the host plants at low elevation there would be the predator issue.”

There are ways residents can help.

“Depending on where people live planting mamaki may help expand habitat for the Kamehameha butterfly particularly at high elevation areas near the current range of the butterfly” Haines said adding on the Big Island that would be in areas such as Volcano Mountain View Kaloko Mauka and even upper Hilo.

But to make the mamaki a more viable habitat for the insect the caterpillars need to be protected from ants.

“This can be done either by applying ant bait in the area or applying non-toxic sticky barriers to the trunk of the tree to prevent ants from climbing it” Haines said.

When it comes to the Hawaiian blue butterfly anyone in Hawai’i can provide potential habitat by planting ‘a‘li‘i in their yard he said since the insect is more widespread and seems to be more likely to colonize in residential areas.

The key according to Haines however might be something as simple as knowing the butterflies are here.

“I think people are generally aware that the Kamehameha butterfly is out there and people know it is special and unique to Hawai’i but I think a big reason why it isn’t on the forefront of people’s minds is that most people do not encounter the butterfly or have an opportunity to get into the areas where it still occurs” he said. “The Hawaiian blue is small less conspicuous and fast-flying and there are several nonnative species that look similar so even though it is more common than the Kamehameha butterfly it is more easily overlooked.”

More outreach and education about the butterflies also can help.

Haines initiated a “citizen science” project during his previous work at the University of Hawai’i where people could submit observations of the Kamehameha butterfly to a website. That project the Pulelehua Project is no longer actively funded but it was moved onto iNaturalist a global database where people can submit photo observations via an app and then a community of naturalists help identify what they saw. Those who use the app also can see what other participants sighted in their neighborhoods.

“This is a great way for people to learn not only about butterflies but all the plants and animals in their environment” Haines said.

You can find the Pulelehua Project in the iNaturalist database by clicking here.

“Any kind of environmental education efforts should involve more native insects in general” Haines said. “People are actually a lot more aware of Kamehameha butterflies than they are virtually any other of our 5000 native insects.”

He added that butterflies are generally popular.

“I think that’s why the citizen science effort actually did take hold and did drum up a lot of interest because people are predisposed to sort of like butterflies” Haines said. “We were able to kind of tap into that interest.”

More projects like the citizen science project and additional funding for these types of programs and environmental education would help raise awareness. It’s also just a matter of people opening their eyes and looking at what’s around them.

“Apps like iNaturalist are great for that because it’s almost like Pokémon” Haines said. “They start collecting these observations around them and then put them online and people ID them and they say ‘Oh I’ve never seen that before. That’s really cool that you found it in Hilo.’ It opens up a whole other world for people.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2ZtYWx0YS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9nbG9iYWwtZGVidC1pbi1hLXJhY2UtYWdhaW5zdC1yaXNpbmctaW50ZXJlc3QtcmF0ZXMtbm9lbGxlLW1pY2FsbGVmLjkyNzU1M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global debt in a race against rising interest rates – Noelle Micallef,"Global corporate bond issuance reached record pace in the first week of the year. As at January 7 global companies raised more than $100 billion worth of bonds as financiers worked in an effort to lock in the low borrowing costs before the expected rise in benchmark interest rates.

While the early-January rush is traditional this amount of new deals may by an early indicator of the issuances expected early this year. Banks and other financial issuers dominated the deals with a number of foreign institutions raising funds in the US markets.

New bonds have been issued by blue-chip names such as MetLife (life insurance company) and Caterpillar as well as pandemic-hit companies such as cruise operator Royal Caribbean. Having said this there are indications that investors may have pulled back on some orders for new bonds after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s (‘Fed’) December meeting were issued last week.

In one of my articles back in October 2021 it was indicated that central bankers insisted that the surging inflation was purely transitory or temporary. However the December meetings held by the Fed the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) suggested that central bankers are worrying that this period of high inflation has become ‘persistent’.

This worry saw the ECB and the Fed sharply scale back their bond-buying programmes and there seems to be a clear shift across the global economy towards a more hawkish outlook on inflation.

While countries like the UK and Norway already raised interest rates to 0.25 per cent (from 0.1 per cent) and to 0.5 per cent (from 0.25 per cent) respectively rising inflation and a tightening job market may indicate that the Fed might also follow this path. In fact in a note published last week Goldman Sachs’ chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote that they expect “to see hikes in March June and September and have now added a hike in December for a total of four in 2022”.

In 2022 we are expecting new bonds to be issued on the local stock market - Noelle Micallef

On the other hand back in November ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the ECB is very unlikely to raise interest rates in 2022 as inflation remains too low. Further confirming this point Governing Council member Klaas Knot indicated that the ECB will be ready for an interest rate hike in early 2023 after ending the remaining bond purchases by the end of 2022.

In 2021 we also saw a number of local companies benefit from persistently-low interest rates. While 2020 was clouded with volatility and uncertainty brought about by the pandemic the vaccine roll-out and the economic recovery led to €242 million worth of corporate bonds being issued on the local stock exchange in 2021.

Meanwhile in 2022 we are expecting new bonds to be issued on the local stock market with the bonds already announced by Gap Group plc and AX Real Estate plc to commence trading in the coming weeks. While we are still far from 2016’s record high of just under €400 million new corporate bonds issued on the Malta Stock Exchange we do expect local companies to take advantage of the current interest rate market.

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is still uncertain for the upcoming year officials in charge of monetary policy downgraded the importance they attached to the coronavirus and its effects on economic activity.

The Fed ECB and the BoE have all highlighted the uncertainty brought about by the Omicron variant although none of them have indicated that it will be pivotal to policy in the coming months. But now it seems that the tightening cycle has begun and if these inflation rates continue to persist central banks will have to face bigger challenges in the near future.

Can they really replace a human financial advisor?,"d3sign

Robots want to be your next financial advisor. Not too long ago that notion may have smacked of sci-fi whimsy — ""Star Wars"" cyborg C-3PO in a power suit on Wall Street perhaps. But robots or so-called ""robo-advisors"" may soon manage more than $1 trillion of Americans' wealth. These aren't actually tangible robots; they're algorithms companies have developed to automate digital investing. Plug some details (age savings goals risk comfort) into a computer or phone app and the algorithm assembles and manages a personalized investment portfolio just for you. More from Personal Finance:

New York's eviction ban expires Saturday. What renters need to know

Divorced? You can collect Social Security benefits from an ex-spouse But is a robo-advisor right for all investors? Is a human better-equipped for the task of money management and financial planning? ""It's suitable for some people and not for others"" Ivory Johnson a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington D.C. said of robo-advisors. ""If you play golf it's just a different golf club. ""Sometimes I use my 7-iron and sometimes I don't — it just depends on where I am.""

Robo-advisors for the everyday investor began popping up around 2008 the year after the iPhone made its public debut. Just over a decade later robo-advisors were managing about $785 billion according to Backend Benchmarking which specializes in research on digital advisors. Dozens of firms have built their own models to capitalize on popularity and an ascendant digital culture.

They include independent shops like Betterment Personal Capital and Wealthfront; traditional Wall Street brokerages like Fidelity Investments Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley; and those like Financial Engines that cater to 401(k) plan investors. Established players that have historically focused on an older wealthier client base can also leverage the technology to court a new class of younger investors who've shown an enthusiasm for the digital financial realm via online stock trading apps like Robinhood and for assets like cryptocurrency. ""They're everywhere now"" David Goldstone research and analytics manager at Backend Benchmarking said of robo-advisors. ""Just about every major bank and discount broker launched one in the past decade.""

Who's a good candidate?

Robots tend to be especially well-suited to newer investors who haven't yet built much wealth and who would like to outsource money management to a professional for a reasonably low cost according to industry experts. For one robo-advisors offer a low barrier to entry due to low or nonexistent account minimums. Acorns Fidelity Go Betterment and Ellevest a robo service for women let clients sign up for their baseline digital service without any prior wealth. Merrill Edge Guided Investing SigFig SoFi Vanguard Group and Wealthfront have minimums ranging from a few dollars up to $3000. Meanwhile traditional firms tend to manage money for clients with at least $250000 to invest Goldstone said. It's perhaps unsurprising that the average robo user skews younger. For example about 90% of the 470000 clients at Wealthfront are under 40 said Elly Stolnitz a company spokeswoman. Their average balance is about $60000.

I think it attracts people who want to delegate away management of their portfolio. Dan Egan vice president of behavioral finance and investing at Betterment

That demographic trend is also a function of a greater digital affinity among millennials and Generation Z who largely grew up as digital natives and may be more attracted to a robo service as a result. ""[Our users] want to be able to manage money the same way they manage other things like [online food delivery via] DoorDash"" Stolnitz said. Betterment also has an average user younger than 40 with a $55000 to $60000 account according to Dan Egan the firm's vice president of behavioral finance and investing. But age and wealth aren't the only factors at play he said. The company has clients in their 60s and 70s with multimillion-dollar portfolios; the oldest user is over 90. ""I think it attracts people who want to delegate away management of their portfolio"" Egan said.

Fees for that management are typically much lower than for a traditional financial advisor charging 1% a year on client assets. The typical robo charges 0.25% to 0.35% annually for their advice service — about a fourth of the cost Goldstone said. In dollar terms that means an investor with $100000 would pay the typical human $1000 a year for their services and $250 to the average robo. (Of course not all human advisors charge a 1% fee. Some have shifted to monthly subscription fees or one-time consultation fees for example.) Some robo-advisors like Charles Schwab and SoFi don't levy any advice fee; others like Fidelity and SigFig only charge on balances of more than $10000. Investments in the portfolio — often low-cost index mutual funds or exchange-traded funds — do carry an additional fee. Some firms invest clients in their name-brand funds which boosts their revenue via fund fees. They may also levy higher account minimums or fees for tiered service levels. ""If you don't have a lot of money you're in your 20s and 30s the portfolios are pretty damn good"" said William Whitt a strategic advisor at Aite-Novarica Group a consulting firm.

Using a purely digital service may come with trade-offs. While digital services do a good job of automating important investment functions (fund choice the stock-bond-cash mix and regular portfolio rebalancing for example) human advisors lament the relative inability of algorithmic programs to talk clients through situations on demand. Those may include the reasoning behind a specific strategy recommendation or handholding in daunting times like job loss or a cratering stock market. Financial planners also believe they're better suited for proactivity and delving into needs of some clients beyond money management — whether tax estate or business planning which may prove too complex or nuanced for an online questionnaire for example. ""We do a lot more than just investing"" said Johnson at Delancey Wealth Management. Helping a client choose whether to exercise stock options buy long-term-care or liability insurance or set up a business as an LLC or another type of entity are likely beyond the scope of a digital advisor Johnson said.

It's also a challenge to automate client psychology. The online questionnaires robo-advisors use to determine the best portfolio for a client can't probe answers and body language in the same way a human advisor might Whitt said. Even determining what makes a client happy — in essence the purpose behind their money — may be beyond the scope of robots according to some experts. ""Financial advisors can ask follow-up questions to fill out a picture and understand"" Whitt said. The Securities and Exchange Commission which conducted a recent review of robo-advice services also questioned whether they always recommended appropriate portfolios given clients' stated risk tolerance. (The agency didn't name specific firms it examined.) Of course not all human advisors are necessarily performing these functions appropriately either. Some may purely manage client investments without assessing goals or other complex financial-planning details — and in this case clients might get more value from a robo-advice relationship. ""I think there's value humans provide"" said Brian Walsh SoFi's senior manager of financial planning. ""But on the investment side I think robos have a huge advantage in being cost-efficient.""

The president’s chief medical advisor and his wife had $10.4 million in investments at the end of 2020 newly-released records show.

That sum — including $2.3 million in unrealized gains — was held in various mutual funds.

Fauci’s 2020 financial disclosure was released publicly Friday night by Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) who Fauci had called a “moron” after he inquired into Fauci’s financial disclosures during a Senate proceeding Tuesday.

“Dr. Fauci was completely dishonest about his financial disclosures being open to the public” Marshall said in a statement. “Dr. Fauci must be held accountable to all Americans who have been suing and requesting for this information but don’t have the power of a Senate office to ask for it.”

Fauci’s 2020 filing — not previously available to the public — details the finances of the nation’s highest-paid federal employee who reportedly made $434312 in 2020 and is on track for a $350000 annual pension upon retirement.

In a mix of trust and retirement accounts he and his wife hold Atlas large-cap mutual funds Pimco’s investment-grade bond fund and a tax-exempt municipal debt fund.

Other holdings include the Pax Ellevate Global Women’s Leadership Fund — which invests in companies highly-rated for “advancing women through gender-diverse boards senior leadership teams and other policies and practices” — and the Matthews Pacific Tiger Fund which focuses on East Asian nations in particular China but excluding Japan.

The filing also disclosed between $250000 and $500000 in a money-market account and between $50000 and $100000 in a 529 tuition account.

Fauci also reported a stake worth between $1000 and $15000 in Jackson Fillmore a trattoria in San Francisco within the district of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “The pasta dishes at Jackson are simple and straightforward but taste like they are made with love” an Infatuation reviewer wrote.

On the income side Fauci was paid between $100000 and $1 million in royalties by McGraw-Hill. And he reported $8100 in honoria and travel reimbursements for virtually appearing at three galas including the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation’s “Ripple of Hope.”

He also got $5198 from the Partnership for Public Service after being named the non-profit’s 2020 federal employee of the year.

Fauci’s finances received new scrutiny this week after Fauci said the “misinformed” Sen. Marshall only had to “ask for” his 2020 disclosure which he said was available to the public.

Fauci’s employer the National Institutes for Health turned over the documents to Marshall on Friday in response to a strongly-worded letter.

But Fauci’s salary for 2021 and 2022 still have yet to be released according to Adam Andrzejewski of OpenTheBooks.com.

The conservative non-profit Judicial Watch sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — NIH’s parent — for documents related to Fauci’s financial affairs in October 2021. HHS has proposed beginning monthly releases starting on Feb. 1 according to court papers.

Thomas Fitton president of Judicial Watch accused the NIH of playing a “shell game” with Fauci’s records.

His 2019 financial disclosure was released by NIH in 2020 after a Freedom of Information Act request from a reporter.

But NIH has never explained the redactions in the 2019 disclosure — or why it processed that document under FOIA when it told media outlets last week including The Post that Fauci’s 2020 filing would need to be requested from the federal Office of Government Ethics through another process.

RESIDENTS of Lekki community on Lagos Island are lamenting the incessant invasion of their homes by monkeys from Nigeria’s top tourism sites the Lekki Conservation Centre (LCC) in search of food.

The monkeys which have become daring in recent times are giving the residents cause for concern following the destruction of properties inflicted on the community by the primates.

According to an article written by Chijioke Iremeka and published by TheGuardian.ng the starving animals whose population is believed to have grown beyond the carrying capacity of the reserve now frequently ‘raid’ homes of residents of the adjoining communities to steal and eat human food and destroy property in the process.

Residents of the Lekki community on Lagos Island are now grappling with how to stop the frequent invasion of their homes by starving monkeys from the Lekki Conservation Centre (LCC) who are looking for food to eat.

It was learnt that the residents of the community have complained to the Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture to come to their rescue to rid their homes of the marauding monkeys but no serious effort has been made to tackle the menace. The residents are now celebrating the yuletide with the animals and may have no option other than to cohabit with them for a long time if nothing is done urgently to restrict the apes to their natural habitat.

The community is blaming the invasion of residents’ homes by the monkeys on an alleged failure by LCC to pay attention to the feeding of the animals or design a way of preventing them from encroaching on the humans’ space.

The menace is becoming scarier with reports that monkeys harbour some zoonotic diseases – can be transmitted from animal to a human being – including monkeypox and Herbesvirus B (Virus B). Herpesvirus B spreads from infected macaque monkeys to human beings.

Monkeypox virus is mostly transmitted to humans from wild animals such as rodents and primates (a group to which monkey belongs). Human-to-human transmission of the virus also occurs.

The Guardian learnt that Macaque monkeys commonly have this virus which can be found in their saliva faeces (poop) urine (pee) or brain or spinal cord tissue.

“The virus may also be found in cells coming from an infected monkey in a laboratory. The B virus survives for hours on surfaces particularly when moist” a medical doctor and surgeon Mrs. Cynthia Okafor said.

When The Guardian visited the affected areas residents of Chevron Estate and Orchid Road in Lekki lamented that despite their regular complaints to the LCC the centre had done nothing about the situation.

Majority of them who spoke to The Guardian said they saw monkeys daily with the population almost overgrowing the reserve.

It was further learnt that non-harvesting of the monkeys in the reserve had led to increasing in the population of the animals and cases of conflicts. Some residents said the monkey regularly invade their homes and shops looking for food to eat and also snatching food from humans.

Experts said there is the need to determine the ideal population of monkeys that could be sustained within the LCC without the apes harming or disturbing residents of the neighbouring communities or their invasion leading to human-monkey conflict as witnessed in Ghana.

The Guardian gathered that the destruction of properties by monkeys was the second most important reason for the human-monkey conflict in Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in Ghana. Therefore there is a need to nip in the bud the brewing human-monkey conflict in the Lekki community.

“Being a reserve located in the peri-urban area that shares a border with human habitation the monkeys source their food from the community” said a zoologist Onyia Sylvia.

According to Sylva the situation in Lekki is similar to the findings of Rajpurohit who stated that monkeys have become commensals and competitors of human beings in and around villages towns and cities.

“A commensal by way of definition is an organism that uses food supplied in the internal or the external environment of the host without establishing a close association with the host for instance by feeding on its tissues” she said.

She added that one of the disadvantages of having monkeys around the living community is raiding homes for food items and the destruction of zinc and rooftops. There are similar destructive actions by monkeys in Lagos. The residents said the monkeys on most occasions stole their goods from shops food from houses and fruits from gardens. The animals also destroy properties including antenna and window nets.

It was gathered that the monkeys sometimes snatch snacks from unwary visitors.

A fun seeker and a tourist in Lagos Mr. Chukwuka Ejiofor who visited the LCC with his other family members during one of the festivities had to wrestle a monkey to get back a meat pie it (monkey) snatched from his son.

The monkey seeing that the boy is a child snatched the meat pie from him.

“This prompted me to apply force on the monkey. I took a stick to beat the monkey and it was at that point that it left my son and I chased it away” the father said about how daring the monkeys have become.

In a video that went viral reportedly shot at Orchid Road a lady was lamenting the invasion of her family home by monkeys who destroyed window nets and rooftops.

“I placed a loaf of bread on my fridge within a few minutes monkeys broke in and took part in it. Monkeys from the LCC are invading our kitchens. We have been battling this menace for months now with no solution as the centre has refused to feed the monkeys and they now go into people’s houses in daylight hours to steal food. We’re tired and need help. It happened in Orchid Road Lekki Lagos” she said.

Another affected resident Josephine Erosele said: “I am scared. These monkeys come to our homes to destroy things. Once they see food items in the house they force themselves into the house. They tear our protective nets on the windows to gain entrance and gulp anything food they see.

“I am scared because of diseases that one can contract from these monkeys. Monkeys shouldn’t be in contact with human food. Though there are people who like monkeys as pets I don’t want them near my kitchen” she quipped.

Erosele said she had changed her house’s protective nets severally because of the invasion of the monkeys. “I am tired of closing my windows even when I am inside the house denying the house refreshing air”.

According to Mr. Nelson Igwe residents of Chevron Estate and environs may soon be relocating or selling off their property to move to a safer place if nothing is done urgently and permanently about the monkeys.

“The monkeys are fond of peeping into people’s kitchens through the window and when they see food items that catch their fancy they tear the net and squeeze through the burglarproof to steal them. “In fact the rule now is for households to remove food items that may attract monkeys from their kitchen or anywhere they can see them else they will vandalise the net to collect the food if they see them. It’s that bad” he said.

The Guardian’s investigation revealed that while bread and snacks are the favourite food of the monkeys they also like fruits like banana plantain paw-paw and apple.

“They have lived among men for a number of decades and they now like what we like. Regularly I put my pot of soup in a lockup cupboard to play safe” Igwe said.

Experts advised that for good neighbourliness the management of the LCC could introduce a compensation scheme for community residents whose properties have been evidentially damaged by monkeys.

We Warned People Not To Feed The Monkeys With Human Food – LCC



WHEN The Guardian visited LCC to get its reaction the centre said the person saddled with the responsibility to speak on the issue wasn’t on the seat. Instead the reporter was given an email address and Whatsapp number to contact.

All efforts made to get the LCC’s reaction failed as the centre didn’t respond to Whatsapp and email messages put across to it.

However a top management staff of the centre said: “We warned the people to stop feeding the monkeys with human food but they wouldn’t listen.

“Ordinarily we have enough food here to feed the monkeys. This place is wild and they can find their food everywhere. We have fished here in the water and we have fruits all over here.”

According to the source the monkeys are not meant to feed on human foods but the benevolence of tourists who come for sightseeing has caused this.

“The monkeys have tasted real human food and they now desire it. We don’t need to go looking for food here because they have enough food in the wild area to feed on; we have enough fruits here that can feed them comfortably. The problem is that they have tested human foods.

“This is a monkeys’ kingdom and there are monkeys everywhere. There are monkeys at Chevron Estate and there are monkeys at Maryland and Gbagada to be precise. So one can’t really say for sure whether the monkeys that invade those estates are from LCC or Chevron or any other place” the source said.

On the population of monkeys in communities experts said that the animals within the reserve were under protection because LCC is a ‘strict nature reserve’ with zero tolerance to hunting. They said for lack of being hunted for food over the years the population increased beyond the means of sustaining them.

An environmentalist and Chairman of Lagos State Urban Forest and Animal Shelter Initiative Desmond Olumuyiwa Majekodunmi said it was likely that the location itself has gone beyond the capacity to maintain the number of the monkeys that are developed there.

“We should also use this as a pinch of understanding and realisation that these monkeys were on the axis long before the humans came to settle there. We the humans are actually the invaders here.

“Having said that we are not going to stop ourselves from the urbanisation process but this is a reminder that in the so-called development we must do it in harmony with nature because nature is obliged to give back what we give to her.

“If we give her (nature) unnecessary stress like we have done in the areas of our urbanisation especially in the Lekki axis though it’s not alone then we will also get undue stress from nature. This is a fundamental law of life.

“It reflected in physics scriptures and it is observable in microcosm and cosmic the law of actions and reactions. In the fundamental law of retributions you reap what you sow. You can’t plant yam and reap cassava.”

On the solution to the menace he said the people running the LCC were equal to the task and were busy working on the solution.

“I believe they will work towards a good solution that will be in harmony with nature.

“Again it’s a small wake up call for us that we must learn how to do whatever we do in harmony with nature. I say small because there are far larger reactions waiting in the wings and are already beginning to express themselves in different parts of the world even here in Nigeria on our coast which is being massively eroded as a result of our actions against nature.

“In the north the massive onslaught on the desert and nature is reacting to what we have done. So let’s not fight nature we can’t win the fight.”

All calls put across to the Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture Ms. Abisola Olusanya were neither picked nor returned at the time of filing this report.

A text message sent to her was not responded to either.



Controlling Animal Overpopulation With Contraceptives



ANIMAL overpopulation is associated with an increase in the human population. The human-caused wildlife population explosions can in turn have substantial negative effects on humans and their environment.

There are solutions to the problem of animal overpopulation that must take into account the people’s affection for wildlife their opposition to the killing of animals and their frequent lack of knowledge about the negative effects of overabundant species.

As practised in China enforced infertility can be an effective though controversial strategy for controlling human populations. Many people also view enforced infertility as an acceptable strategy for controlling wildlife.

According to Philips Adams an environmentalist the LCC is overpopulated and controlling the population of any species involves issues that are ecological political moral and ethical. The population of the monkeys has surpassed the carrying capacity of the reserve.

“From an ecological perspective it is clear how to control a wildlife population – reducing the available food and habitat to lower the carrying capacity compensate for the missing predators by killing individuals in the population or slowing down the population’s ability to reproduce.

“On a local scale it can be helpful to discourage people from feeding wildlife. On a larger scale however reducing food and habitat is often the least viable option because it will typically require restricting the access of large herbivores to millions of hectares of land” he said.

In a controversial approach in 2009 the Australian government ordered the army to shoot 6 000 kangaroos as a way of controlling the population.

The action was opposed by animal rights activists and by many Australians who consider kangaroo a national symbol that should be protected.

The activists obtained a court injunction to stop the culling of the species but after a delay the kangaroo cull proceeded.

Throughout the world even when all parties agree that the overabundance of a species poses major problems for humans and for the environment culling a herd through shooting is an increasingly unpopular strategy.

The Guardian learnt that a strategy that has more public support is birth control. This approach is common in cities where many feral cats are trapped neutered and returned to the wild.

Researchers are also investigating ways to give animals contraceptive drugs to reduce their populations over time.

The drugs being developed differ in their modes of action ranging from chemicals that prevent animals from making critical reproductive hormones to chemicals that prevent sperm from fertilising an egg.

Contraceptive strategies are currently being tested on a variety of species including deer kangaroos elephants and monk parakeets.

Drugs can be administered to some animals via dart guns. For others such as monk parakeets researchers are working on ways to administer medications in food.

Some contraceptive drugs last for a single breeding season and require a new dose each season which can be so challenging.

In South Africa a wildlife biologist shoots a dart containing contraceptives at a female elephant. The goal is to reduce the overabundant elephant population and reduce the destructive effects of these elephants on the habitat.

The LCC



IT was established in 1990 to serve as a biodiversity conservation icon and environment education centre. It is located along the Lekki-Epe Expressway in the Lekki Peninsula opposite Chevron.

The Chevron Corporation built the facility for the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) as a reserved sanctuary for the rich flora and fauna of the Lekki Peninsula.

The company has since provided annual funding for the management of the centre.

The website has temporarily suspended his account over COVID-19 misinformation specifically for saying masks are useless in preventing the coronavirus' spread. YouTube updated its rules in 2020 to prohibit ""content about COVID-19 that poses a serious risk of egregious harm."" It doesn't permit videos with medical misinformation that contradicts local health authorities such as the World Health Organization.

The organization considers wearing masks ""a key measure to reduce transmission and save lives."" That's why YouTube explicitly states that videos containing claims that wearing masks have negative side effects and that they don't play a role in preventing the contraction or transmission of COVID-19 go against its policy. The website has suspended several creators for COVID-19 disinformation in the past including Sky News Australia One American News Network and Senator Rand Paul.

Bongino is only getting a week-long suspension because it's his first strike under the policy. If he gets another strike within 90 days he'll get another two-week suspension. His channel will only be removed if he gets a third strike within three months. In addition to suspending his uploads YouTube has also demonetized his channel for ""repeatedly violating [its] Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines on harmful and dangerous acts."" He will however be able to re-apply for the Partner Program after 30 days.

That said it looks like Bongino has plans to keep posting about masks and their supposed failure to prevent the transmission and contraction of the virus. The Bongino Report website's Twitter account posted a copy of his email to YouTube which tells the customer service rep that he will ""immediately post content on why masks have been totally ineffective in stopping this pandemic"" after his suspension is over. He dared YouTube to do something about it. Bongino also called the website (and by extension Google) a ""tyrannical free speech-hating bullshit big tech shithole.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

(KOLN) - Lincoln Fire and Rescue responded to a fire at New Covenant Community Church on Saturday.

According to LFR a call for smoke showing from the church came in just before 3 a.m. When crews arrived they reported fire into the roof.

LFR said a lightning strike is suspected but not confirmed to be the cause of the fire.

According to the fire inspector’s initial estimate the fire caused $1.5 million in damage to the building with a large amount of the damage up in-between the roof and the ceiling.

A spokesperson for the church said on social media that the church will hold a gathering on Sunday in the front parking lot at 10:30 a.m. for worship and prayer. Any additional service and programming has been cancelled. The spokesperson also asked that people avoid going inside the church for the time being due to multiple hazards.

Representatives of the church have already met with insurance and a crew is on site to begin clean-up and restoration.

This incident is still under investigation. Stay connected to 1011now.com for the latest updates.

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

This Sunday the lot is empty. Still people that go here did meet but instead of meeting up for a sermon they went out to serve the community all across Jefferson County.

Austin Johnson is in the kitchen of a fire station in Watertown pulling pork.

Johnson and his team put a BBQ together for city firefighters. He says serving is something we should all put into practice.

“We are led to serve just like Jesus served us as he walked on this earth and so we want to be like Jesus and do what Jesus does and one of those big things is serving and serving your community and helping others” said Johnson.

After a quick prayer it was time to dig in. The church team made enough food for both the day and night side shifts at the fire hall.

“It’s been fantastic to see some people in the community come in the food has been awesome we had great BBQ” said Watertown City Firefighter Chad Crosby.

Kids were also part of this team and got to interact with the fire engines.

Crosby says what he appreciated the most:

“For coming in and spending their time with us the food was wonderful met some great people heard some cool stories people as far way as Africa Alaska from California from Texas.”

Around 15 groups like this one served Jefferson County throughout the weekend at places like homes schools and fire stations.

Track and Field

ASU track and field kicked off the 2022 indoor season Friday competing against NAU in Flagstaff. Only the throwers and vaulters participated in this meet with ASU claiming two golds and six total podium finishes.

Redshirt senior Turner Washington last year’s NCAA champion in the discus and indoor and outdoor shot put took first place in the men’s shot put with a 21.33-meter throw. Graduate student Ian Schulz and freshman Ralford Mullings took fourth and seventh place respectively.

Sophomore Mya Lesnar won first place in the women’s shot put with a 15.65-meter throw.

Freshman Paris Bond earned herself two podiums in her first meet as a Sun Devil. She placed second in the high jump with a leap of 1.66 meters and finished in a tie for third in the pole vault with teammate Kristen Masucci reaching a height of 3.65 meters.

The full squad will be competing in the University of New Mexico MLK Invitational in Albuquerque New Mexico on Jan 22.

Men’s tennis

ASU started the season right against GCU Friday with a 7-0 win at the Whiteman Tennis Center in Tempe.

The Lopes won only one set in six singles matches and none in three doubles matches. “I thought the team did very well today” sophomore Max McKennon said. “(Head coach Matt Hill) said it was the cleanest match we ever had.”

The day started with a 6-1 win in doubles from captains McKennon and senior Fabien Salle who ranked 42nd in the most recent ITA doubles ratings. “Ever since Fabien got to Tempe we have been close” McKennon said. “He is one of my best friends on the team.”

Freshman Murphy Cassone and junior Jacob Bullard followed with a 6-2 win in their first spring doubles match for ASU. Freshman Nicola Cigna and junior George Stoupe rounded out doubles play with a 6-4 win in Cigna’s first spring game as a Sun Devil.

ASU continued to dominate by winning each of the six singles matches. The only match that went to three sets was Bullard's against GCU freshman Martim Marujo who was defeated in the third set 6-1.

“It was fun to see so many new faces we had four new players in the lineup today” Hill said. “For them to put on the ASU jersey for the first time and get a win they did a great job.”

The Sun Devils take on Texas A&M next on Jan. 19 at 1 pm MST. “(The Aggies) are a different caliber of team their head coach Steve Denton is one of the best in the country” Hill said. “They’ll be ready and well-prepared we will be too.”

Swim and Dive

Despite the highly anticipated ASU swim and dive meet versus Utah being canceled due to COVID-19 protocols within Utah’s program ASU was still able to put on a show in an intrasquad scrimmage while the seniors on the team were honored.

The event started on a joyous note with the seniors accompanied by their loved ones and cheered on by teammates and coaches.

Yesterday we did it for our seniors 🥲❤️ pic.twitter.com/ebvfKEudX0 — Sun Devil Swim/Dive (@ASUSwimDive) January 15 2022

Once the competition began the youth on the team showed why the Sun Devils are in good hands moving forward. Freshman Léon Marchand won the 200-yard freestyle with an impressive 1:33.26. Freshman Charli Brown won the women's 100-yard backstroke with a final time of 53.46.

It was not a normal intrasquad scrimmage as members of ASU’s pro group competed in most of the events. Olympian Olivia Smoliga 27 won both the women's 200-yard freestyle and the women's 200-yard backstroke.

As the meet came to a close Sun Devil fans soaked in every last bit of the meet since ASU will not swim at home for the rest of the season.

ASU swim and dive will look to start its spring season on a high note when they compete against Stanford on Jan. 21 at 3 p.m. MST.

Wrestling

No. 6 ASU wrestling suffered its second and third straight losses over the weekend. No. 19 University of Pittsburgh upset ASU 24-19 Friday night.

Despite being heavily favored in the matchup and taking a 6-0 lead by wins from redshirt juniors Brandon Courtney and Michael McGee ASU struggled late in the meet.

Redshirt freshman Julian Chlebove was pinned by ACC Wrestler of the Week Cole Matthews to tie the score at six points apiece.

ASU took a 16-6 lead after two decisions and a major decision but Pittsburgh's James Lledo pinned redshirt freshman Zane Coleman in the 174-pound weight class to cut the deficit to 16-12.

Sun Devil redshirt freshman Josh Nummer encountered a rare stalling disqualification against Gregg Harvey giving the Panthers the lead for the first time 18-16.

Pittsburgh's Nino Bonaccorsi then pinned freshman Jake Ortiz to take a 24-16 lead. Although redshirt freshman Cohlton Schultz scored an 18-5 major decision win over Jake Slinger it was not enough for the Sun Devils to top the Panthers.

On Sunday morning ASU suffered its third straight loss dropping to No. 22 Princeton 20-18.

Princeton's Patrick Glory secured a decision over Courtney to set the tone for the dual.

McGee and Schultz both secured wins in the meet but ASU failed to secure the victory over Princeton.

ASU hopes to bounce back from its two road losses over the weekend on Jan. 21 against Cal Poly.

Gymnastics

The ASU gymnastics team kicked off its season on Saturday against Michigan losing 197.950-196.275. Despite the loss the Sun Devils produced their best season-opening score in program history.

Junior Hannah Scharf started right where she left off last year scoring a 9.900 on floor and did not record anything less than a 9.850 in any of the four events she competed in. Freshman Alex Theodorou made an immediate impact for the Sun Devils in her debut. She scored the first 9.900 of the season on vault and later added a 9.850 on bars and 9.875 on floor to her statline.

ASU will look to bounce back and earn its first win of the season against No. 4 Utah on Jan. 21 at 7 p.m. MST in Salt Lake City.

He was born to Junior Arthur McGirr and Hazel Katherine McGirr (nee Trott). He lost his parents and step-mother Aunt Margaret Heckeman long ago. He is predeceased by two older brothers Richard McGirr in 2013 and John McGirr in 2020. He is survived by his wife of years Geraldine (Gerri nee Schillig) McGirr his sister Margaret (Peg) Nichols (Fred) James McGirr (Karen) and Susie Robbins.

Dale attended The Ohio State University as an Honors student graduating in 1970 with a degree in Corporate Finance. Using a deferral from his Air Force ROTC duty to attend graduate school he completed a Masters in Public Administration and Public Finance in 1972. Dale served as an officer in the Air Force at Wright Patterson AFB as a Procurement Officer buying F-5E fighters. After his discharge he went to work for the newly formed Ohio Legislative Budget Office doing non-partisan financial analyses for members of the Ohio General Assembly and was also assigned as the monitoring staff for the Ohio Board of Regents. It was this latter assignment that convince Dale that Higher Education Administration at a large public university was to be his chosen field. Such an opportunity appeared in 1977 when the City of Cincinnati University became the newest member of the State of Ohio University System. Dale started that summer as the Budget Director became Assistant Vice President for Finance in 1980 and Vice President for Finance in 1985. He later became Sr. Vice President for Finance and Planning and retired in 2006. He made many improvements to systems and policies over the years but his most innovative changes were in two areas: 1. He led the creation of neighborhood development corporations in all the surrounding neighborhoods and partnered with them to create many new developments over the years that have changed the character of Uptown Cincinnati; 2. He led the team to create the new Campus Master Plan in 1989 which has re-branded the University of Cincinnati at a national scale. That has contributed to UC's continuous growth in enrollment quality of applicant and growing research program ever since.

At a personal level Dale and Gerri were married in 1969 after five years of engagement. It was the greatest gift to be together for all these years. They loved to travel and have visited over 30 countries over the years. Dale and Gerri had no children but made a commitment to children in 1981 that they would provide many children with opportunities they would not otherwise have. The ultimately focused in three areas over the years: travel college scholarships and hosting foreign exchange students. In the years since then Dale and Gerri have provided domestic and European travel together to over 20 children ranging from nieces and nephews to Godchildren and family friends' children. And they have hosted 13 exchange students from Spain as well keeping connections and visiting Spain frequently to see them to this day. All these children are real parts of our lives and given us more back that we ever gave them.

Dale loved Gerri like no other. And together they loved their work their lives and their connections with children. A life well lived is a treasure to take and remember with pride.

A graveside inurnment will take place at Spring Grove Cemetery on Thursday January 20 3 PM. Please join the family at Spring Grove Funeral Home for procession (4389 Spring Grove Ave.). A celebration of life will immediately follow at the funeral home where a time of sharing will take place at 4 PM.

Mereka juga mengabaikan ayat-ayat Alquran karena terlalu mencintai dunia. Hal ini dijelaskan dalam Surah Yunus Ayat 7-8 dan tafsirnya.

اِنَّ الَّذِيْنَ لَا يَرْجُوْنَ لِقَاۤءَنَا وَرَضُوْا بِالْحَيٰوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَاطْمَـَٔنُّوْا بِهَا وَالَّذِيْنَ هُمْ عَنْ اٰيٰتِنَا غٰفِلُوْنَۙ

اُولٰۤىِٕكَ مَأْوٰىهُمُ النَّارُ بِمَا كَانُوْا يَكْسِبُوْنَ

Sesungguhnya orang-orang yang tidak mengharapkan (tidak percaya akan) pertemuan dengan Kami dan merasa puas dengan kehidupan dunia serta merasa tenteram dengan (kehidupan) itu dan orang-orang yang melalaikan ayat-ayat Kami mereka itu tempatnya di neraka karena apa yang telah mereka lakukan. (QS Yunus: 7-8).

Menurut Tafsir Kementerian Agama ayat-ayat ini menerangkan bahwa alasan orang-orang yang tidak meyakini akan adanya pertemuan dengan Allah di akhirat nanti di mana semua amal perbuatan akan ditimbang dengan adil karena mereka lebih mencintai kehidupan dunia. Mereka rela menukar kesenangan hidup di akhirat dengan kesenangan hidup di dunia yang fana ini.

Cisco’s networking heritage really comes to the fore with its three flagship ranges of IP phones: the 6800 7800 and 8800 series of devices.

Please note This is our all-in-one roundup reviewing three of Cisco's flagship ranges of VoIP devices for 2021. On this page after our brief intro you’ll find (a) a full evaluation of the Cisco IP Phone 6800 range along with our assessment of the essential features modern businesses depend on (b) a review of the Cisco IP Phone 7800 range and (c) our take on the high-end Cisco IP Phone 8800 range which offers video support and other UC features (d) a look at the security protocols that will help you safeguard against emerging threats. (e) and an examination of the environmental credentials of Cisco's IP handsets. You can jump to the reviews of those individual products by clicking on the links in the bar at the top of this page but bear in mind that this article is really designed to be read all the way through as businesses will benefit from assessing all three phone ranges before deciding which one best suits their needs.

The US firm is known as a major player in the IT networking and cybersecurity sectors and has been making VoIP handsets since the late 1990s. In the intervening years Cisco has greatly ramped up the features that it includes within its VoIP devices which can now offer video conferencing tools and artificial intelligence (AI) functionality.

One of the things that makes Cisco’s IP phones so suitable for businesses regardless of their size is the range of devices that customers can choose from. From more entry-level offerings all the way up to enterprise-standard handsets the company understands that no two businesses are the same and communication needs are changing all the time. Whether organizations plump for a device from the 6800 7800 or 8800 range they’ll receive a reliable VoIP phone with a robust suite of features.

Cisco IP Phone 6800 Series

Although the 6800 range may not be as flashy as some of Cisco’s other VoIP offerings it still delivers reliable business-grade audio in an energy-efficient package that will appeal to many organizations. Specifically designed for companies with “moderate to active VoIP needs” the 6800 range gives businesses five models to choose from depending on their specific needs.

Most of the handsets that make up the 6800 series do come with a greyscale display which may be disappointing if employees are used to working with color VoIP solutions but in most cases these concerns will be forgotten once the high-fidelity audio becomes apparent. Devices in the series also come with fully programmable line buttons which can be customized for SIP registrations or call features like speed dialing.

With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing many businesses to adopt remote working policies VoIP handsets have become more important than ever for firms wishing to remain in contact with their employees and clients. Fortunately the 6800 series has a number of specific futures that are aimed at boosting productivity wherever employees are based. These include the ability to handle multiple calls fixed-function buttons that provide one-touch access to important features and localized language support for international users.

Comparing the different models the Cisco IP Phone 6821 supports two SIP registrations while the 6841 and 6851 models both support up to four SIP registrations. The 6851 handset also supports the Key Expansion Module which adds 14 physical buttons along with access to 14 additional on-screen buttons. The extra functionality provided by the module is likely to prove particularly useful for organizations with a larger number of employees.

The premium offering within the 6800 range is the Cisco IP Phone 6871 which comes with a color display six SIP registrations four soft keys and a USB-A port. The device is also wall-mountable and comes with power over Ethernet functionality. Unfortunately even at this end of the scale there’s little in the way of special features. Don’t expect the screen supplied with the 6871 to deliver high definition visuals for example.

So while the 6800 range may not offer slick features it still provides all the core functionality that businesses have come to expect from their VoIP handsets. What’s more the devices are also supported by Cisco-approved third-party unified communications as a service (UCaaS) providers so there’s no need for organizations to make-do with a subpar VoIP solution when using these handsets.

Delivering a more full-featured experience than the 6800 range the 7800 series offers users four different devices to choose from all of which are designed to be simple secure and energy-efficient. The models are aimed at businesses small to large that wish to improve productivity among their employees.

All of the 7800 models boast the latest security and encryption solutions so organizations need not worry about audio data being intercepted or interfered with. Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) and Transport Layer Security 1.2 are employed to help protect the intellectual property of your business. This security also extends to remote workers who can connect to the Cisco network using the Cisco Expressway without the need for a dedicated VPN solution when using a 7800 series phone.

There are a number of features included as standard across the 7800 series including wideband audio and echo cancellation. Overall businesses should receive a high-quality communication experience when using one of Cisco’s 7800 VoIP handsets as the company has worked hard to ensure that crystal clear audio is delivered even among the more affordable models. Vibration isolation has been employed for all the hardware for example to ensure that unwanted noises do not distract from the audio experience.

Looking at each particular model in-turn the 7811 phone is well suited for workers with light VoIP needs. It comes with an IEEE 10/100 integrated switch to support a co-located PC as well as a 3.28-inch monochrome display. It supports just one phone line and comes with eight fixed feature keys.

The 7821 meanwhile is ideal for businesses that have slightly more intensive VoIP needs and the model also comes with more aesthetic options being offered in either charcoal or white designs. It has two lines a backlit 3.5-inch grayscale display and is paired with a wall-mount kit for organizations that have limited desk space. The 7841 handset offers all the above and more offering four programmable line keys that feature tricolor LEDs as call status notifiers.

The most active VoIP users are more likely to need the 7861 device however which comes with 16 programmable line keys as well as 11 fixed feature keys. Interestingly the handset also comes with a paper insert that users can print locally and customize to allow for one-touch access to frequently used contacts or essential features.

Although the 7800 series still lacks a touch of the glamour that accompanies some higher-end VoIP handsets it has all the essential features that employees need and so represents a great choice for moderate VoIP users.

Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series

Boasting nine different models to choose from Cisco’s 8800 series of IP phones certainly provides businesses with plenty of flexibility. The broad portfolio does come at a cost particularly when compared with some of the other models offered by Cisco but considering the rich feature list accompanying these handsets businesses can still feel like they are receiving value for money.

The 8800 series comes at the advanced end of Cisco’s VoIP portfolio and so users can expect top performance flexible deployment options and cutting-edge telephony features. Individuals with environmental concerns around purchasing yet another electronic device can also rest assured. Select models within the 8800 range use post-consumer recycled plastic in their construction demonstrating Cisco’s commitment to furthering the circular economy.

Other features worth looking out for across select 8800 devices are 720p high-definition video output integrated support for Cisco’s Intelligent Proximity for Mobile Voice when using personal mobile devices and high-performance audio conferencing for up to 42 participants. Cisco Spark the company’s cloud-based collaboration suite can also be deployed with 8800 devices to take part in Spark voice or video calls.

Collectively the 8800 series includes six desk phone models (the 8811 8841 8845 8851 8861 and 8865) the IP conference phone 8832 and the 8821 and 8821-EX handsets for in campus mobile workers. Given that collaboration - particularly via video conferencing software - has become increasingly important during the COVID-19 pandemic the ability to collaborate using high-definition video with 8800 handsets is likely to prove hugely useful.

Some features that are common to the 8811 8841 8845 8851 8861 and 8865 models include the option of using between five and 10 line keys increased productivity due to a five-way navigation cluster and four context-sensitive soft-label keys and fixed keys for the most commonly used features. Power over Ethernet support is also available to help reduce or eliminate the need for local power supplies.

One of the higher-end models offered by Cisco is the IP Phone 8861 which comes with a second USB port for fast-charging other devices as well as support for 802.11a/b/g/n/ac network protocols. The handset can also be elevated further with the addition of the IP Phone 8851/8861 Key Expansion Module which supports an additional 84 programmable feature keys to deliver added scalability.

For businesses that really need access to video communication features without having to employ a separate device Cisco’s 8800 range ticks a lot of boxes. With security reliability and a host of customizable buttons to get to grips with these VoIP handsets are difficult to beat.

Security

(Image credit: Cisco)

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic a great deal of sensitive information that would once have been conveyed in person is now being transmitted via remote communication tools - including VoIP handsets. Unfortunately cyberattackers have cottoned on to this development and have already launched a number of malicious attempts to steal this vital information. For example late last year cybersecurity firm Check Point Research discovered a cyber fraud operation led by hackers in Gaza the West Bank and Egypt that compromised VoIP servers being used by more than 1200 organizations across 60 countries.

As a result of this evolving threat landscape VoIP handsets are beginning to take security more seriously. At Cisco a number of upgraded safeguards have been included alongside its latest models - including the 7800 and 8800 ranges. For example both models guarantee that only authentic Cisco firmware can be installed on the handsets. The firmware is signed with a 2048-bit RSA key and verified before activation.

Both the 7800 and 8800 series also employ cryptographic identity certificates to ensure added protection. Each phone contains a unique Manufacturing Installed Certificate (MIC) that provides a factory-installed unique identity. At the same time each phone supports a Local Significant Certificate (LSC) that binds the phones to a customer’s environment.

Altogether the Cisco 7800 and 8800 phones clearly take security extremely seriously. The handsets provide a number of protections out of the box and they can be administratively hardened via a variety of other security protocols including encryption and cryptographic algorithms for added protection. If you want a handset that will remain one step ahead of the hackers the latest Cisco models are worth considering.

Environmental credentials

Sustainability has become an increasingly important concern for businesses across all industries. In order to meet their green ambitions tackling electronic waste (e-waste) is a prominent concern. Globally electronic waste generation reached a record high of 53.6 million metric tons in 2019 an increase of 21% in just five years. This is equivalent to approximately 7.3 kilograms of e-waste per person.

E-waste is normally grouped into six categories: temperature-exchange equipment screens and monitors lamps large equipment like washing machines or photocopiers small equipment such as cameras and smart speakers and small IT and telecommunications equipment - including phones. However the fact that the IP Phone 8800 can lay claim to being Cisco’s first closed-loop plastic product means that it’s a handset that can meet both communicative and environmental needs.

Cisco has adopted circular design principles in several of its products by pioneering the use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. Specific models within the IP Phone 8800 Series now reduce the use of natural resources while closing the loop with its own electronic waste at the same time.

The first step involves sourcing used plastic from Cisco’s electronic waste and separating it appropriately. The PCR is then processed and turned into resin pellets which are mixed with additives molded into individual parts and used to create new products such as 8800 handsets.

Altogether Cisco products made with PCR plastic avoid the use of more than 3 million pounds of virgin plastic per year. As well as providing secure reliable and cost-effective VoIP handsets that boast all the features that a company could need Cisco also has a handset that will help organizations to meet their sustainability goals.

Cisco VoIP Phone 6800 7800 and 8800 series: our overall verdict

When looking at the sheer number of different VoIP handsets available across the 6800 7800 and 8800 ranges it’s understandable if businesses feel a little overwhelmed.

However as long as managers and IT leaders have a clear idea of the kind of telephony features they need there’s certain to be a Cisco phone that fits the bill. The unparalleled range and flexibility provided by these handsets are what makes them such great all-rounders within the VoIP handset space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMTYvbWlubmVzb3Rhcy1pc2xhbmQtbGFrZS1nZXRzLWl0cy1maXJzdC1jaXNjby1zdG9ja2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota's Island Lake gets its first cisco stocking,"DULUTH — Island Lake has received its first-ever stocking of cisco a fatty little fish hoped to beef up the size of walleyes in the popular reservoir.

Biologists for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources netted 250 adult cisco from Hanging Horn Lake near Barnum in early December just before the fish spawned and just before the lake iced over and moved them to Island Lake north of Duluth where they are expected to provide a high-calorie food for walleye.

It’s the first installment of what should be several cisco stockings said Dan Wilfond Duluth-area fisheries specialist for the DNR. The agency intends to stock about 4000 cisco each year for the next five years.

It’s hoped the cisco will then become self-sustaining reproducing and filling a niche in Island Lake’s food chain.

Hanging Horn Lake was picked as the source because the cisco there were confirmed as disease-free and because it was the closest to Duluth with a sizable cisco population. But the little fish proved maddeningly hard to capture and keep alive so Wilfond said other donor lakes in Itasca and Cook counties will also be eyed in future years both to increase supply and add genetic diversity.

“No one should expect that throwing 250 cisco into Island Lake is going to create a big year class of cisco in 2022 and somehow turn the lake around quickly” Wilfond told the News Tribune. “It’s going to be a years-long process … but we’re on the board. There are a few of them in the lake now. We’ve got the process rolling.”

Island Lake has excellent walleye reproduction almost every year one of the best lakes in the Northland. But those walleyes then grow extremely slowly among the slowest of any lake in the Northland. Anglers have complained about the small size of walleyes they catch on Island lake for decades dubbing the common 12-inch fish “Island lake Specials.” And DNR surveys found the same thing for the sprawling 10800-acre lake: an average size of about 12 inches down from about 17 inches 40 years ago.

Biologists say an inadequate food supply too many small walleyes competing for too few minnows may be part of the problem. So they moved ahead with a two-pronged effort to fix it.

The first change which began with the 2021 open-water fishing season last May included a new bag limit of 10 walleye daily for Island Lake — up from six fish daily — with anglers encouraged to catch and keep more small fish. All walleyes kept must be under 15 inches. All walleyes 15 to 20 inches must be immediately released and anglers can keep one walleye daily over 20 inches.

It’s the first time ever in Minnesota that the DNR has used a higher bag limit to reduce overall walleye numbers and improve average size. Island Lake now has the highest bag limit for walleye in the state. The increased limit compares to the general limit of six walleyes daily in Minnesota although many lakes have four-walleye limits and there’s a push at the state Legislature to lower the statewide limit to four walleyes daily for lakes that don’t have special regulations.

The cisco stocking forms the other half of the DNR’s Island Lake walleye effort.

“We’ll be monitoring the lake as we continue to stock them conducting assessments to see whether they take hold or not” Wilfond noted adding that he’s “cautiously optimistic” the DNR efforts will help boost the size of Island Lake walleyes.

In addition to lack of food Wilfond has said Island Lake walleyes may be impacted by spiny water fleas. In 1990 Island Lake became the first inland lake in Minnesota confirmed with the invasive species a Eurasian native that likely arrived in the Twin Ports in the ballast of ships. It appears walleye growth has slowed even more since they arrived. It’s possible the spiny water fleas are causing a reduction in some small fish species in the lake that walleye could eat.

Data shows cisco should thrive in Island Lake especially in the deeper cool-water zones of the reservoir but also that cisco eat spiny water fleas and may help reduce spiny water flea numbers in the lake.

It’s unclear if the cisco were so hard to catch because of the unusually warm autumn that kept water temperatures above the prime spawning level or some other reasons. Efforts to use traps in shallow waters near where cisco were supposed to be spawning produced zero fish Wilfond noted. He said it took two weeks of trying before crews finally collected 250 cisco using gill nets that were quickly retrieved to keep the fish alive far from their 4000-cisco goal.

“Hopefully we’ll have better luck next year and in following years. We’re going to have some other source lakes to fall back on” he said noting it may be many years until anglers start seeing more big walleyes in Island lake as a result of the effort.

Island Lake is a man-made reservoir created in the early 20th century by damming the Cloquet River. It’s used by Minnesota Power as a water storage reservoir for its hydroelectric dam system on the St. Louis River near Carlton.

The DNR has conducted previous cisco introductions into Lake Elmo in the eastern Twin Cities into several Cuyuna Range mine pits near Brainerd and into Long Lake near Walker. In each case the cisco population became self-sustaining.

ABOUT CISCO

Cisco also called lake herring (especially in Lake Superior) and inland tullibee. The word “cisco” comes from a French name. Cisco are members of the Salmonidae family which includes trout salmon lake whitefish and char.

Where do they live?

Cisco are common in Lake Superior but they also occur in many inland lakes of the central and northeast regions of Minnesota. The cisco is a cold-water fish that needs well-oxygenated water deep in the lake in summer so they usually do best in deep clearwater lakes.

How big are they?

Their size is highly variable depending on the lake. In Cass Lake for example adults get as large as 12 to 14 inches long. In Lake Itasca they sometimes reach up to 24 inches and 4 pounds. In Ten Mile Lake they rarely go beyond 3.2 inches. Cisco in Lake Superior average about a foot long but some have been caught up to 24 inches. The Hanging Horn Lake cisco moved to Island Lake averaged about 6 inches long with one up to 14 inches.

What do they eat?

They begin eating copepods and small water fleas and later add bigger water fleas midge and ghost midge larvae. Sometimes they feast on mayflies and caddisflies as the bugs hatch at the water’s surface.

What eats them?

Young and smaller cisco fall prey to many kinds of bigger fish including northern pike lake trout burbot yellow perch rainbow trout musky and walleyes. Some people net and eat cisco from some northern inland lakes and they are netted in Lake Superior where the so-called lake herring are considered prime table fare.

How do they reproduce?

They spawn in late fall usually late November. The spawning sites are commonly in shallow water over bottoms of clean rock gravel or sand. A single female may lay 3000 to 15000 eggs depending on her size. The embryos develop over the winter and hatch the following spring.

Niron born in 2012 in a University of Minnesota laboratory is constructing a pilot plant that will build magnets and a limited number of small prototype electric motors with partner-customers. The critical magnets should be produced at half-or-less of today's economic and environmental costs.

They will help power more efficiently if Niron's management and investors are right the next generation of electric vehicles wind turbines medical and other electric-powered equipment in a greener economy.

In the last several months alone 21-employee Niron has raised nearly $30 million in private and public capital. Prospective investors are watching intently.

""We expect in 2022 to distribute small quantity engineering samples to customers and prototype motors to be tested"" said Niron CEO Andy Blackburn. ""We're working with customers to design motors and other devices. We have a lot of interest with 'rare-earth' prices going through the roof.''

These next generation magnets built with plentiful recyclable iron and nitrogen are designed to replace the expensive rare-earth materials largely found in China that must be extracted from the ground and create significant pollution when processed.

Niron Magnetics is developing an advanced manufacturing process for the mass production of permanent magnets.

The four-year-old university spinoff is building a 25000-square-foot pilot plant next to its research facility in northeast Minneapolis.

""The challenge has been that a lot of low-carbon technologies have significant environmental challenges dirty secrets'' quipped Blackburn. ""Such as rare-earth materials lithium and cobalt for batteries. It can be environmentally degrading.

""The low-carbon economy requires massive electrification. And requires a whole new family of devices that turn motion into electricity such as wind turbines. And new families of devices that turn electricity into motion such as electric vehicles.""

And most of today's electric motors are based on century-old technology and are relatively inefficient in powering air conditioners elevators appliances and factory equipment.

""High-strength permanent magnets will allow us to not only decarbonize electricity but also make our existing consumers of electricity more efficient"" Blackburn said. ""It's the retrofitting of our electrical world. It's going to take a lot of next-generation magnets.""

Niron said its magnets will be the world's first commercialized high-performance magnets free of rare earth minerals. The elusive secret sauce was finding and exploiting the correct chemical arrangements with iron nitrogen and other materials.

""This particular arrangement has eluded people for a long time for scientific and engineering reasons"" Blackburn said last week. ""We've been able to crack that task.""

Niron says its process ""combines breakthroughs in nanomaterials with … mature metallurgical methods to deliver high-performance magnets at half the cost.''

This also could help trigger an industry worth hundreds of billions and acceleration of an enhanced renewable-powered economy that significantly cuts greenhouse gases.

Niron Magnetics last year raised $21.5 million in mostly private venture capital as well as a $5 million U.S. Department of Energy grant. It's working with partners such as Volvo Volta Energy Technologies and General Motors. The automakers are seeking more efficient drivetrains and other equipment that feature North American magnets.

""We are very excited about teaming with Niron Magnetics and see their 'Iron Nitride' permanent magnets as a key enabling technology"" Ayman El-Refaie project coordinator and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Marquette University told Automotive Industries magazine recently. ""Beyond this project Niron's technology will help achieve higher performance over a broad range of applications.''

Blackburn 62 is a veteran technology executive who holds master's degrees in aeronautical engineering and business from Stanford. A veteran of Cisco and other tech companies he joined in 2017 to shepherd Niron Magnetics from lab to commercialization.

""You don't tackle climate change just pulling stuff off the shelf"" Blackburn said last week. ""It takes innovation. It has been tricky. We're working with 'nanostructured material.' Very small-scale material. And we're replacing a whole bunch of old technology with new technology.""

The demand and price for rare earth and other key metals globally has been driven astronomically by surging demand for wind turbines electric vehicles and other electric-powered equipment on wheels in offices homes and plants.

""Magnets have not kept pace with demand of higher performance lighter-weight machines"" Blackburn said. ""As hybrid and electric vehicles fill the streets and wind-power generation continues to be one of the fastest-growing means of producing electricity the demand for increased efficiency needs to be met with innovative new magnetic material.

""There's no downside to what we are doing. What attracts people is it has so many positives. We have a way to do well while doing good. That's what energizes the team.""

By Valentine Hilaire

MEXICO CITY - Mexican entrepreneur Javier Garza Calderon aims to bid on the consumer banking arm of Citigroup in the country pledging to return it to Mexican hands he said in a statement Sunday.

Garza Calderon founder of the organization ""Entrepreneurs for the Fourth National Transformation (E4T)"" said he was interested in inviting other business leaders to form a group of investors to analyze the possible acquisition.

""I perceive a great opportunity to rescue its historical cultural and financial assets so that they return to the hands of Mexican businessmen"" Garza Calderon said in a statement shared with Reuters.

""A team of national and international analysts and specialists will evaluate all the lines of business that Citi Banamex handles and subsequently we will make an offer"" he added.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Thursday named Garza Calderon as a potential bidder https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-president-urges-mexican-investors-bid-citi-assets-2022-01-13 after Citigroup said this week it would sell its Citibanamex consumer banking operations ending a two decade retail presence in Mexico.

Still commonly known as Banamex the bank Citi bought in 2001 has long been a fixture on Mexican high streets.

Lopez Obrador has urged Mexican investors to snap up the assets with the aim of ""Mexicanizing"" the bank.

Garza Calderon's organization E4T is a business association that supports Lopez Obrador's so-called Fourth Transformation (4T) to root out corruption and inequality according to the group's website.

Mexican tycoon Ricardo Salinas billionaire Carlos Slim of Grupo Financiero Inbursa and Carlos Hank Gonzalez chairman of the board of Grupo Financiero Banorte could also be interested in the sale Lopez Obrador said.

Howard was one of the greatest power hitters of his era averaging 49.5 home runs from 2006 to 2009. We may never see another Phillies hitter go on a tear quite like Howard did in our lifetime so it’s best to celebrate his career as best as we can.

Ryan Howard is one of the greatest players in Phillies history. (Icon Sportswire)

As part of the site’s Ryan Howard Month here are the top six home runs of The Big Piece’s career.

6. Howard breaks two records with one swing — June 27 2007 vs. Cincinnati Reds

It’s hard to know exactly what the longest home run in Citizens Bank Park history is. For the sake of simplicity it’s either Howard’s 2007 home run to Ashburn Alley off the Mets’ Orlando Hernandez or this supposed 505-foot blast off Aaron Harang against the Cincinnati Reds. Sorry Evan Gattis.

What we do know for sure is that Howard’s 100th home run broke a record. In his 325th game Howard became the fastest player in MLB history to hit 100 home runs breaking Ralph Kiner’s 385-game mark.

Even in the era of juiced balls and launch angle Howard’s record still stands.

On this day in 2007 @ryanhoward hit a 505-foot home run setting records for the longest blast at Citizens Bank Park and the fastest player to 100 home runs in major league history (325 games). pic.twitter.com/3Mx0Il406a — Citizens Bank Park (@PhilliesCBP) June 27 2021

5. Howard comes out on top against Lohse — 2011 NLDS Game 1

Let’s ignore the ending of the 2011 NLDS and focus on Howard’s incredible at-bat. Prior to Howard stepping up to the plate Kyle Lohse embarrassed the opposing lineup limiting his former Phillies team to just a run on two hits through the first five innings.

Jimmy Rollins and Hunter Pence came through with two singles in the bottom of the sixth. Lohse was fine with giving Howard a free pass but the Cardinals pitcher badly hung a changeup on the third 3-2 pitch of the at-bat. Howard drove the pitch into the seats in right field and it led to a seven-run offensive outburst and a Game 1 victory for the Phillies.

4. No. 58 — September 22 2006 vs. Florida Marlins

Fun fact: Marlins manager Joe Girardi intentionally walked Howard four times in the series after the Phillies first baseman hit his 58th home run of 2006 against Ricky Nolasco.

Howard broke the Philadelphia Athletics’ Jimmie Foxx’s record for most home runs in a single season by a professional baseball player in Philadelphia. He also tied Chuck Klein’s single-season record for most home runs by a Phillies player in Philadelphia.

Numbers make this particular home run special but the moment itself carried weight as far as the playoff race was concerned. As Howard chased greatness his team was looking to stay ahead in the NL Wild Card standings. The Phillies fell short but Howard’s dominance along with the atmosphere that came along with a pennant race served as a taste for what the next five years had in store for Phillies fans.

3. 50 51 52 — September 9 2006 (Game 1) vs. Atlanta Braves

“It’s the greatest show on Earth” said Chris Wheeler as Howard rounded the bases after his third home run of the game. Days after hitting an absolute tank to the upper deck in right center field at RFK Stadium Howard became the only Phillie to hit 50 home runs.

All three of Howard’s home runs that day came off of Tim Hudson who just happens to be on the 2022 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot with Howard. Howard was a career .343 hitter against Hudson with seven home runs and 20 RBIs. Fortunately for Hudson Chris Volstad owns the honor of being the pitcher who surrendered the most home runs against Howard (eight).

I’m cheating by lumping all three home runs together but I’m sure Howard’s Homers wouldn’t mind.

2. Howard goes opposite field in the Fall Classic — 2008 World Series Game 4 (4th inning)

Howard hit eight postseason home runs in his career. His most memorable stretch in the playoffs came in the 2009 National League Championship Series against the Dodgers but his home run in the bottom of the fourth inning in Game 4 of the World Series was the most impactful out of all.

It’s a shame that Joe Buck made little attempt to sell the moment in his lackadaisical call. There’s a lot of Buck apologists out there and while he has gotten better at calling baseball I’ll always hold a grudge for his performance during the 2008 World Series.

Buck’s call on Howard’s second home run later in the game was much better.

1. Howard takes Mussina to the third deck — June 20 2006 vs. New York Yankees

Howard is for real. And how cool is it that he got to do his best Babe Ruth imitation against the Yankees? — Phil Sheridan

There’s a lot to love about this: Harry Kalas’ call Joe Torre’s menacing look and Brett Myers and Ryan Madson’s reaction from the dugout are just a few reasons why this is one of the best Phillies home runs to watch on repeat. In front of nearly 45000 fans at Citizens Bank Park Howard put on a show. He hit Citizens Bank Park’s first-ever third deck shot (Barry Bonds was close a month earlier) and drove in seven runs thanks to another home run off future Hall of Famer Mike Mussina and a triple his first of the season.

And the Phillies lost that game. He’s the only player in MLB history to hit a triple two home runs and drive in seven RBIs in a game in which his team lost.

According to Sheridan’s column in the Philadelphia Inquirer the day after the ball landed in the hands of a nine-year-old boy who wanted to bring his glove to the game but his dad told him: “No one’s ever hit one up there.”

Arrest

Jan. 8 8 a.m.: Police responded to a call from Home Depot about a shoplifter. A man was seen concealing several tools in a trash bag and left the store without paying. The tools were worth $459.99. The man was stopped and the tools were recovered. The store did not request shoplifting charges but Police found that the man had an outstanding warrant. Dante Gattoni 50 of Boston was arrested on the warrant from Roxbury District Court for larceny under $1200.

Incidents

Jan. 5 8:43 a.m.: The owner of Bling Boutique reported that someone had thrown a traffic cone through a window of the store on Main Street and shattered the glass. It did not appear that anyone got into the store and nothing was reported missing. It is now clear where the cone came from. It had an NStar marking on it. Police are investigating.

Jan. 5 1:37 p.m.: A Bailey Road resident reported a credit card fraud. In November 2021 someone used her Citizens Bank card to charge $700 to her account. She reported it and the bank issued her a new bank account number and card. In December she noticed another $700 in fraudulent charges were made on her account. It appears someone stole her identity and gained access to her account. The bank is investigating.

Jan. 6 11:15 a.m.: A vehicle parked in the River Works parking lot on Pleasant Street had its catalytic converter. It was taken from a 2004 Ford F-250 overnight from Jan. 5 to Jan. 6. Police said thefts of catalytic converters have been on the rise in the Metro Boston area over the last few months.

Jan. 6 1:47 p.m.: A car pulled up at the Watertown Gas and Service station on Watertown Street and the driver spoke to the attendant. There were also two passengers. The driver gave the attendant a credit card and asked to put gas in the tank. He also asked the attendant to run the credit card inside the office and not at the gas pump because his credit card company puts a hold on his credit card when it is used at the pump. The attendant said he couldn’t do that because there were a lot of people waiting. He said he could run the card at the tank or the driver could get gas at another station. The driver got out of the car and punched the attendant in the head and then a female passenger got out and sprayed the attendant in the face with pepper spray. They got back into the car and drove away. Using the surveillance video police were able to identify the female passenger who also was the owner of the car. The 25-year-old woman from Boston was summoned to Waltham District Court for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Police are trying to identify the driver.

Between Jan. 6 and Jan. 8 five vehicles were broken into at an apartment building on Pleasant Street. The windows were broken and items were taken from the vehicles when they were parked in the garage. Taken items include about $60 in cash cologne valued at $100 and a leather shoulder bag valued at $300. The most valuable item taken was a DJ turn table valued at $500. Police are investigating.

Jan. 6: Police had two outstanding warrants for domestic violence related charges. They learned the man was at the victim’s home on Robert Ford Road and were able to speak with the victim and got her safely out of the home. After numerous attempts to negotiate with the suspect the suspect refused to come out of the home. Police obtained a search warrant and gained entry to the home with help of the NEMLEC SWAT Team. The suspect was placed safely into custody without further incident. There were no injuries to anyone involved. The incident lasted about five hours.

Jan. 7 8:40 p.m.: A Main Street resident reported that someone broke into his apartment. The man is a part-time resident and said it occurred between Dec. 29 and Jan. 1. While it is believed that someone got into the apartment nothing was missing. It appears that someone may have been squatting in the apartment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcmV2aWV3aW5ndGhlYnJldy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8xNS9icmV3ZXJzLXJhbmtpbmctNS13b3JzdC1jb250cmFjdHMtZnJhbmNoaXNlLWhpc3RvcnkvMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brewers: Ranking The 5 Worst Contracts In Franchise History,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYm9zb3hpbmplY3Rpb24uY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMTUvMTAtYmFzZWJhbGwtY2FyZHMtdGVsbC1zdG9yeS1ib3N0b24tcmVkLXNveC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Baseball Cards that tell the story of the Boston Red Sox,Next.

""As a result of a massive cyber attack the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies are temporarily down"" Oleg Nikolenko MFA spokesperson tweeted.

The Security Service of Ukraine the country's law-enforcement authority alluded to a possible Russian involvement pointing fingers at the hacker groups associated with the Russian secret services while branding the intrusions as a supply chain attack that involved hacking the ""infrastructure of a commercial company that had access to the rights to administer the web resources affected by the attack.""

Prior to the update from the SSU the Ukrainian CERT claimed that the attacks may have exploited a security vulnerability in Laravel-based October CMS (CVE-2021-32648) which could be abused by an adversary to gain access to an account using a specially crafted request.

The breach targeted a number of government websites including those for Ukraine's Cabinet education agriculture emergency energy veterans affairs and environment ministries among others 10 websites of which were ""subjected to unauthorized interference.""

The security agency however stressed that content of the sites was not altered and that no sensitive personal data was stolen.

""Provocative messages were posted on the main page of the websites"" the SSU said. ""The content of the sites was not changed and according to preliminary information no leakage of personal data occurred.""

This is far from the first time Russia has set its sights on Ukraine. In December 2015 a nation-state adversary tracked as Sandworm targeted the power grid resulting in unprecedented blackouts for roughly 230000 consumers in the nation.

Two years later Ukraine was also at the receiving end of the devastating NotPetya wiper malware campaign by the Sandworm military hackers that erased confidential data from the computers of banks and energy firms.

Then in November 2021 the SSU unmasked the real identities of five Russian intelligence officials allegedly involved in over 5000 cyberattacks attributed to a cyber-espionage group named Gamaredon aimed at public authorities and critical infrastructure located in the country.

""The purpose of such attacks is to destabilize the internal situation in the country as well as to sow chaos and disbelief in society"" the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security said noting the hacks amount to ""psychological pressure and intimidation.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L25hZ3B1ci9yZWd1bGFyLWVuZXJneS10aGVyYXBpZXMtYW5kLXNwaXJpdHVhbGl0eS1jYW4tYm9vc3QtaW1tdW5pdHkvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODg5MjIwMzguY21z0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvbmFncHVyL3JlZ3VsYXItZW5lcmd5LXRoZXJhcGllcy1hbmQtc3Bpcml0dWFsaXR5LWNhbi1ib29zdC1pbW11bml0eS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODg5MjIwMzguY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Regular energy therapies and spirituality can boost immunity’,Dr Saraah Chimthanawala a well-known homeopath (gold medalist) having experience of 36 years has 1underlined the significance of mind playing a stronger role than medicines in a person’s well-being. A quantum energy practitioner for the last 20 years Dr Chimthanawala believes the science of thoughts and emotions will play a crucial role in the coming days whether to cure an ailment or build immunity than the products emerging from laboratories.Dr Chimthanawala highlighted the significance of thought-process in healing soul body and mind devastated by the pandemic.Excerpts from the interview...Q. What is the scope of energy healing in Covid times?A. There is enough research across the globe depicting the components of universe as energies frequencies pilot waves quantum entanglements and so on. Going by physiology even our body is comprised of energy frequency and we are also vibrational beings. Meditation reiki pranic access bars sound therapy mantra healing and such practices are energy therapies. Among Covid patients we have observed an effective combination of homeopathy and energy therapies. A regular use of energy therapies can boost immunity.Q. How mind thought and emotions affect immunity and ability to fight diseases?A. My observations and experiments over two decades have shown that the mind thoughts and emotions are reasons behind the ‘dis-ease state’ of the frequency of cells manifesting into an ailment. Every negative thought and emotions create vibrations which disturb the frequency of cell leaving it in a state of anomaly. Symptoms start surfacing gradually as the adverse frequency gains momentum and begins to spread. Even allopathy doctors refer to stress and tension in diseases like hypertension diabetes and so on. The beta brainwave is state of awareness but excess of it releases cortisol which brings down immunity. Alpha brainwaves release chemicals which heal and relax our body. Fear is one of the factors behind excess beta state. Positive thoughts keep you in alpha and negative in beta. I have been spreading this message through webinars across the nation.Q. Will spirituality and spiritual healing help cope with the stress of living in the pandemic?A. Spirituality and spiritual healing are the need of the hour. Spirituality is not just about walking off to an ashram or following rituals but as per me it’s more about following simple tools like gratitude love and forgiveness. It is more scientific than what others may perceive. Wellness can be ushered through meditation chanting positive affirmations and so on to cover mind body and soul. The motto should be ‘change your thoughts to change your life’.Q. Does energy healing and such practices help expedite recovery during and after Covid?A. Our observations with Covid patients since the onset of symptoms and throughout the recuperation recovery and rehabilitation period have been encouraging. As energy healing therapies works on mind body and soul the recovery period is shortened and immunity gets stronger.Q. Do energy healing and emotional releases also help professionals overcome career issues?A. It is certainly not a magic wand that would bring results overnight. Losses and setbacks during the pandemic have led to depressions despairs and fears. It has resulted in increase in hypertension diabetes cardiac problems and so on. Meditations visualizations and other energy therapies and their modules are helping people become mentally and emotionally stronger. The mental clarity achieved after energy therapies have led to many new ventures and start-ups. Even women have started businesses whether cooking boutiques chocolate-making and so on.Q. How energy healing helps one get mentally stronger and spiritually balanced?A. There is a technique to energy healing and spirituality. It is supposed to be integrated in one’s life. Practicing the technique daily would transform one to attain the frequency of wellness. It would lead to a balanced and stronger mental and spiritual state. There is no need to follow anyone blindly.Q. Would energy healing even help victims of domestic violence that witnessed a spurt during the lockdown?A. Domestic violence victims need counselling and emotional release sessions. Other therapies like balancing techniques and karmic cord cutting help break the pattern of traumas. A complete release of negativities requires minimum 21 days to three months of therapies. Then a scheduled follow up is also required.Q. Do energy therapies help youngsters too?A. Positive affirmations and creative visualizations are great modules to help in programming the subconscious mind to manifest one’s desires. We grow up within a limited framework of family values which shapes our belief system and the subconscious mind also gets programmed accordingly. Our belief system also restricts our talent strengths and abilities.Q. Can energy healing help overcome irreversible losses?A. Any negative situation may lead to depression and even physical illnesses. Again emotional release sessions help in getting rid of emotional stresses grief and depression. It should be practised minimum 21 days to three months.Q. How do spirituality and energy healing help one find true meaning of life?A. I always ask my clients and patients ‘Have you met yourself or know who you are?’ It sounds weird but it’s necessary. Meditation helps you know yourself better. When in state of conscious awareness of your inner being you make effort to know self and purpose of life. You start meeting the right person at the right time and situation which ultimately takes you to the path you were chosen for. One must change one’s thought to change one’s life.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvb2lsLWluZGlhLWV4aXRzLXVzLXNoYWxlLXZlbnR1cmUtc2VsbHMtMjAtcGMtc3Rha2UtZm9yLTI1LW1pbGxpb24vYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODg5Mjc5NjYuY21z0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9lbmVyZ3kvb2lsLWdhcy9vaWwtaW5kaWEtZXhpdHMtdXMtc2hhbGUtdmVudHVyZS1zZWxscy0yMC1wYy1zdGFrZS1mb3ItMjUtbWlsbGlvbi9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODg5Mjc5NjYuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil India exits US shale venture sells 20 pc stake for $25 million,"

State-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) has exited from a US shale oil venture selling its 20 per cent stake to its venture partner for USD 25 million -- the second exit of an Indian firm from the US shale business in two months.""Oil India (USA) Inc (wholly owned subsidiary of OIL) divested its entire stake in Niobrara shale asset  USA"" a regulatory filing by the company said adding the consideration received was USD 25 million.OIL and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had together in October 2012 bought a 30 per cent stake in Houston-based Carrizo Oil & Gas's Niobrara shale asset in Colorado for USD 82.5 million.While OIL had acquired 20 per cent IOC bought 10 per cent in Carrizo's Niobrara basin acreage assets through their respective subsidiaries.The total investment of USD 82.5 million included an upfront cash payment of USD 41.25 million and a carry amount of USD 41.25 million linked to Carrizo's future drilling and development cost.The stake was sold to Verdad Resources LLC which is the operator of the asset.Originally OIL acquired the 20 per cent interest in the liquid rich shale asset in the Denver-Julesburg Basin from Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. Carrizo sold its entire stake in the Niobrara asset to Verdad Resources LLC in January 2018. As a result Verdad became the new operator of the asset.Haimo Oil & Gas holds the remaining 10 per cent stake in the project.The move by OIL follows Reliance Industries Ltd's exit from US shale which has not been attractive in generating returns.In November last year Reliance said its wholly-owned subsidiary Reliance Eagleford Upstream Holding LP has signed an agreement with Ensign Operating III LLC to divest its interest in upstream assets in the Eagleford shale play of Texas.With this Reliance has divested all its shale gas assets and exited the shale gas business in North America. The firm had previously divested its entire stake in the Marcellus shale blocks.State gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd continues to hold a 20 per cent stake in Carrizo's Eagle Ford shale acreage which it had acquired in 2011.OIL in the filing said its subsidiary Oil India (USA) Inc had reported a net profit of USD 279000 on a revenue of USD 4.27 million in the fiscal year ending March 31 2021.When in 2012 it and IOC bought a stake in Niobrara they were to receive a 30 per cent interest in Carrizo's production of about 1850 barrels of oil-equivalent a day from 24 gross wells.Carrizo held 61500 gross acres in the Niobrara basin of which the Oil India-IOC consortium had 18450 acres spread over three counties in Texas.Apart from participating in Carrizo/Verdad operated wells OIL USA has also participated in wells drilled by other operators in the region such as Noble Energy Whiting Oil and Gas Mallards Bison energy etc. Net production to OIL was about 415 barrels of oil equivalent.OIL whose assets in the northeast account for its entire crude oil production and the bulk of gas production had aggressively scouted for overseas assets in the last decade.As a result it acquired interest in oil and gas exploration and producing assets from Venezuela to Russia. It continues to hold those assets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuYS5iaC9lbi9TRUFQcmVzaWRlbnRwYXJ0aWNpcGF0ZXNpbklSRU5BQXNzZW1ibHkuYXNweD9jbXM9cThGbUZKZ2lzY0wyZndJek9OMSUyQkR1RnhVUG9yUlAwMWVETFhPR0YycnNFJTNE0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SEA President participates in IRENA Assembly,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bna.bh/en/SEAPresidentparticipatesinIRENAAssembly.aspx?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2BDuFxUPorRP01eDLXOGF2rsE%3D on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuYS5iaC9lbi9TRUFQcmVzaWRlbnRwYXJ0aWNpcGF0ZXNpbklSRU5BQXNzZW1ibHkuYXNweD9jbXM9cThGbUZKZ2lzY0wyZndJek9OMSUyQkR1RnhVUG9yUlAwMWVETFhPR0YycnNFJTNE0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Former Audi factory racing project manager Andreas Roos will succeed Krack as the new head of BMW M Motorsport on Feb. 1.

Krack was appointed as the manufacturer’s racing department director in March 2021 but will depart to become the team principal of the Aston Martin Cognizant Formula 1 Team replacing Otmar Szafnauer.

Working with the now-former BMW M CEO Markus Flasch Krack’s BMW tenure included the rollout of the M4 GT3 which is making its global customer racing debut this year and the announcement of an LMDh program in collaboration with Dallara.

“We would like to thank Mike Krack for his passion and dedication across the motorsport portfolio of BMW and BMW M” said BMW M CEO Franciscus van Meel.

“He has demonstrated his wholehearted commitment to motorsport in various roles within our company. As Head of BMW M Motorsport he took some important decisions over the past year aimed at securing a successful future for our motorsport projects.

“He has now been given the chance to fulfill a career dream and we do not want to stand in his way. We would like to wish Mike every success in his future endeavors.

“At the same time we are delighted to welcome Andreas Roos as our new Head of BMW M Motorsport.

“He has also held senior management positions in international motorsport for many years and his vast experience makes him the ideal appointment at the helm of our racing involvement.

“With Andreas on board we are in the best possible shape to enjoy an exciting future pursuing ambitious goals with our new BMW M4 GT3 and LMDh project.

“We are looking forward to enjoying great success together.”

Krack is set to return to the Formula 1 paddock after previously working with BMW-Sauber in an engineering role that included working with a younger Sebastian Vettel.

“This was not an easy decision for me” he commented.

“I have spent a large portion of my professional life at BMW and have grown incredibly fond of the brand and my colleagues over all these great years.

“I would like to say thank you for everything we have achieved together through the many different projects.

“However it has always been a dream of mine to return to Formula 1 one day – and now I have been given the chance to do that.

“I would like to thank BMW M GmbH for supporting me along this path and enabling a smooth handover to my successor. I wish Andreas Roos luck and am in no doubt that BMW M Motorsport will be successful under his leadership.”

BMW’s new motorsport director Roos arrives at the Munich-based company after a decade with Audi that focused on the manufacturer’s works motorsport programs in different disciplines such as endurance racing DTM and off-road.

“I’m very much looking forward to my new role and thank BMW M GmbH for the trust they have shown in me” said Roos.

“I have of course followed BMW M in motorsport for many years and it is something very special for me to now be able to play a leading role in the next chapter of the brand’s success story on the race track.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9mb290YmFsbC9icmFkeS10aHJvd3MtZm9yLTItdGRzLXNiLWNoYW1waW9ucy1kb21pbmF0ZS1lYWdsZXMtMzEtMTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Brady throws for 2 TDs Super Bowl champions dominate Eagles 31-15,"TAMPA Fla. — Tom Brady threw for 271 yards and two touchdowns helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers launch their bid for a return to the Super Bowl with a dominating 31-15 NFC wild-card playoff victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.

It wasn't until after filming wrapped that they got a wakeup call.

It’s been years since the final Twilight movie was released in theaters. And while the mania has quelled quite a bit the five films are still beloved by millions around the world. Furthermore popular streaming services like Netflix have helped the films to cast a spell on new audiences and enchant older fans into falling in love with the movies once more.

Of course the Twilight movies had a dedicated audience before the first actor was even cast. Thanks to the eponymous books written by Stephenie Meyer Bella and Edward’s love story had already enraptured thousands. But even the masses of dedicated bibliophiles weren’t enough to predict what a global phenomenon the films would become.

The ‘Twilight’ cast thought they were just making a cool indie movie

Those cast in the Twilight movies have been candid about how much fun they had on the set of the first film. Determined to make something more than just a cheesy teen love story everyone was very committed to the project. And while they were cognizant that they were making something special they had no idea that they’d tapped into something so intense.

In an interview with Insider Nikki Reed (who was cast as Rosalie Hale in the Twilight movies) reflected on shooting the first film. “We knew we were making something cool but we didn’t really know the extent of it until well after we finished filming” Reed shared.

Nikki Reed remembers thinking the film would be small until her castmates went to Comic-Con

So when did the cast realize the potential of the Twilight movies? The cast cites Comic-Con as a turning point. “The moment we realized it was Comic-Con” Reed continued. “I remember sitting at home because for the first film I think only Rob and Kristen were asked to go to Comic-Con and not the whole cast yet. And at the time we thought we were just making this relatively small-ish movie. It definitely wasn’t this blockbuster cultural phenomenon. It was a cool little vampire movie. And then something wild happened.”

That something wild took the form of thousands of screaming fans. Reed recalls seeing “lines of cars and people on the streets just screaming when they saw Rob get out of his car to walk into the Comic-Con hotel. “I remember being like ‘Oh my God it’s crazy. It’s like he’s famous or something.”

Reed recalls realizing that she and her castmates would be making more ‘Twilight’ movies

It may be hard to imagine but until Comic-Con happened the cast didn’t even know if they’d be making more than one Twilight movie let alone five. However once they saw the fan reaction Reed said they knew they’d likely be reprising their roles in the cast.

“Everybody who makes something that’s part of a book series or a trilogy or something you’re always like ‘Hmm we’d like to make the other ones but who knows if we will'” Reed revealed. “And then I think we realized ‘Wow we’re definitely gonna make another one and maybe even two or three more things.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vdHJhay5pbi90YWdzL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDEvMTUvaW5mb3N5cy1jYW4tYmVhdC1jb2duaXphbnQtdG8tYmVjb21lLTJuZC1iaWdnZXN0LWl0LWZpcm0tYnV0LWhvdy13aGVuL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vdHJhay5pbi90YWdzL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDEvMTUvaW5mb3N5cy1jYW4tYmVhdC1jb2duaXphbnQtdG8tYmVjb21lLTJuZC1iaWdnZXN0LWl0LWZpcm0tYnV0LWhvdy13aGVuL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Infosys Can Beat Cognizant To Become 2nd Biggest IT Firm: But How?

Cunningham was having one of the best games of his rookie season before he was ejected in the third quarter after getting his second technical foul Sunday against the Phoenix Suns at Little Caesars Arena.

Cunningham dunked over Suns center Jalen Smith and pointed in the air — either at Smith or at the Pistons’ bench — and the officials gave him his second technical foul with 4:22 left in the period.

“After he dunked the ball he was assessed a technical foul for a physical taunt for pointing at the defender” said Kevin Cutler the officiating crew chief in the pool report.

Cunningham already had gotten a technical foul at the 8:41 mark of the third quarter after saying something to an official likely about a foul that wasn’t called on an earlier play. He finished with 21 points on 9-of-15 shooting in 24 minutes.

He said his pointing looked worse than it was because he had family and friends in the stands right behind the Pistons’ bench the end where the play occurred.

“I had my people right behind the bench. I went baseline to dunk the ball and (Smith’s) right in between me and my people so I probably should read that situation better” Cunningham said. “I don't really get into taunting too much. I'm usually chilling after the play happens or whatever but I realized the situation after he teched me up.

“Obviously I didn't think I was going to get a tech so I tried to go holler at (Suns coach Monty Williams) over there and let him know (it was a) good game.”

It was Cunningham’s first ejection of the season; he previously had just one technical foul.

At the time the Pistons were trailing 89-69.

There were five technical fouls in the game (four by the Pistons) and coach Dwane Casey said they don’t want to get a reputation of a team that complains to officials about calls or missed calls.

“We're not in a position as a team to complain. Let me be the bad guy (to argue) to fight for us” Casey said “but as a young team we shouldn't get that reputation of complaining to the officials and until we get to that level we've got to button up and zip up and play our butts off.”

Competitors like Comcast and Dish have never carried it and YouTube demonetized and suspended OANN’s channel in 2021 for pushing misinformation. To call OANN ""controversial"" would be an understatement; the network's support of Donald Trump's repeatedly debunked allegations of election fraud has already prompted legal action.

Most interestingly though Reuters reported in 2021 that OANN got as much as 90 percent of its revenue from contracts with AT&T which is a majority owner of DirecTV following a corporate spin-off a year ago. John Oliver even sounded off on AT&T for funding the network on his show which itself is bankrolled by AT&T. Per the Reuters story OANN’s accountant testified under oath that the network would have practically no value without the DirecTV deal.

In other words the far-right news network could face serious financial troubles in the near future if it can’t find an equally bountiful source of funds. We don’t wish them luck on that venture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aW5nbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvc29jY2VyL25ld3MvbmJjc24td2F0Y2gtcHJlbWllci1sZWFndWUtc29jY2VyLXNwb3J0cy13aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkL29xdDA1a2t5M25qZDEzeTB0aHpvaW93MHfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happened to NBCSN? Where to watch Premier League soccer other sports in 2022,"NBC has held the U.S. television rights to the Premier League since 2016 and during that time fans have grown accustomed to watching many of those matches and other EPL shoulder programming on NBC Sports Channel popularly known as NBCSN which became the de facto TV home of the Premier League.

But that changed when NBCSN was shut down on Jan. 1 2022. And it will take some time to get used to for fans of the Premier League.

With NBCSN ceasing operations NBC has made USA Network the new English-language home of the English Premier League in the United States beginning in 2022. USA Network previously served as an occasional overflow channel for matches often in cases of concurrent high-profile matches.

Below are all the details for Premier League fans to continue watching their favorite teams and players uninterrupted.

Why was NBCSN shut down?

NBCSN has been a fixture for U.S. sports fans since it's launch as the Outdoor Life Network (OLN) in 1995 originally broadcasting outdoor sports such as fishing hunting and eventually becoming known for its coverage of the Tour de France. The network was rebranded as Versus in 2006 and took on coverage of the NHL combat sports and NASCAR.

In January 2012 shortly after Comcast merged with NBC the network was again rebranded to NBC Sports Network and a year later that moniker was officially shortened NBCSN. By 2020 the network was tabbed as the second-most watched sports network after ESPN.

NBC Sports chairman Pete Bevacqua first announced the shutdown of NBCSN to employees in a memo on January 22 2021 and then formally made it public later in the year.

NBC has been tight-lipped on the exact reason why NBCSN is being shut down only calling it ""part of a larger transition"" in the internal memo. But it's widely speculated that the shutdown of NBCSN is part of the company's desire to push more sports content to its Peacock streaming service hoping to entice fans to subscribe.

(DIRECTV Stream and U-verse will also cut the channel from their lineups.)

“We informed Herring Networks (OAN’s owner) that following a routine internal review we do not plan to enter into a new contract when our current agreement expires” DIRECTV said in a statement.

The satcaster did not say when the current agreement with OAN expires. But Bloomberg News which first reported that DIRECTV would drop OAN says it will end in April.

OAN which has been a favorite channel of former President Trump has been a political thorn in DIRECTV’s side since Reuters reported last October that AT&T encouraged Robert Herring the owner of Herring Networks to start the news channel several years ago. (AT&T was then the sole owner of DIRECTV. The communications giant has since sold a 30 percent minority stake to private equity firm TPG.)

The article said AT&T promised Herring that DIRECTV would carry the channel which would mean millions of dollars in carriage fees for his company. (AT&T has disputed the article’s main assertions.)

The Reuters story has triggered a wave of criticism towards AT&T from liberals who say the communications giant is responsible for creating a news channel that Democrats (and even some Republicans) allege engages in purposeful disinformation on topics such as vaccine effectiveness the 2020 presidential election and the Covid-19 pandemic. OAN denies the charge saying that it’s simply offering viewpoints that differ from those held by their opponents.

While OAN is also carried by Verizon and a few small cable operators the loss of DIRECTV could make it difficult for the channel to survive.

DIRECTV’s decision to drop OAN could become more important if the satcaster decides to merge with Dish. Democrats who are in control of the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission the agencies that would rule on the merger are not partial to OAN.

The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that the Internal Revenue Service and the estate’s administrator Comerica Bank & Trust agreed to value Prince’s estate $156.4 million a figure that the artist’s heirs have also accepted.

The valuation dwarfs Comerica’s earlier $82.3 million appraisal. The Internal Revenue Service in 2020 had valued the estate at $163.2 million.

Prince who died of a fentanyl overdose in 2016 did not leave a will.

Since then lawyers and consultants have been paid tens of millions of dollars to administer his estate and come up with a plan for its distribution. Two of Prince’s six sibling heirs Alfred Jackson and John R. Nelson have since died. Two others are in their 80s.

“It has been a long six years” L. Londell McMillan an attorney for three of Prince’s siblings said at a hearing Friday (Jan. 14) in Carver County District Court.

In the end the estate will be almost evenly divided between a well-funded New York music company — Primary Wave — and the three oldest of the music icon’s six heirs or their families.

The IRS and Comerica settled last spring on the real-estate portion of Prince’s estate. But the trickier task of valuing intangible assets such as rights to Prince’s music was not completed until October.

As part of the agreement the IRS dropped a $6.4 million “accuracy-related penalty” it had levied on Prince’s estate. The Minnesota Department of Revenue which agreed on the estate’s valuation also has dropped an accuracy penalty the filing said.

Taxes on Prince’s fortune will run into the tens of millions of dollars.

Just over $5 million of Prince’s estate will be exempted from taxes under federal law but thereafter the tax rate is 40%. In Minnesota the first $3 million is tax-exempt; after that much of Prince’s estate will likely be taxed at 16%.

In mid-2020 Comerica sued the IRS in U.S. Tax Court saying the agency’s calculations of the estate’s value were riddled with errors. A tax trial set for March in St. Paul has been canceled because of the settlement.

Comerica in a court filing Friday said that while the IRS settlement was “fair and reasonable” it believes it would have “prevailed” in the tax court case. Comerica said it told Prince’s heirs that if lowering estate taxes was their “primary interest” they should continue pressing the IRS and — if need be — go to trial.

“Instead the members of the heir group have uniformly communicated to (Comerica) their strong desire that the estate settle with the taxing authorities” the filing said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi9tdXNpYy9uZXdzL3ByaW5jZS1lc3RhdGUtdmFsdWVkLTE1Ni1taWxsaW9uLTEyMzUxNTU1Nzcv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIyL211c2ljL25ld3MvcHJpbmNlLWVzdGF0ZS12YWx1ZWQtMTU2LW1pbGxpb24tMTIzNTE1NTU3Ny9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prince’s Estate Valued at $156.4 Million — Almost Double an Earlier Appraisal,"After nearly six years of wide-ranging assessments parties involved with Prince‘s estate have finally agreed on its value: $156.4 million according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune and the Associated Press.

The estate’s outgoing administrator Comerica Bank & Trust had valued it at $82.3 million provoking howls of outrage from multiple parties not least the heirs of the late artist who died in 2016 without leaving a will. Last year the Internal Revenue Service valued it at an amount much closer to the final number $163.2 million.

With an agreement between Comerica and the IRS and clearance from the heirs the process of distributing Prince’s wealth could begin as soon as next month the report says. While even the new number seems small in comparison with the sums commanded by Bruce Springsteen’s publishing and recorded-music catalogs (around $550 million sources say) or Bob Dylan’s or David Bowie’s publishing alone (nearly $400 million and upward of $250 million respectively) it is based on the value of Prince’s estate at the time of his death in April of 2016 well before the song-catalog gold rush that has emerged in recent years. Also the dispute has run up tens of millions of dollars in legal fees and the filing states the heirs were eager to settle.

“It has been a long six years” L. Londell McMillan an attorney for three of Prince’s siblings said at hearing on Friday in Carver County District Court reflecting the long complicated and costly process of settling the estate which is said to have cost tens of millions.

Popular on Variety

Six of Prince’s siblings or half siblings were determined to be the heirs; Primary Wave Music and Prince’s three oldest siblings hold ownership of the estate; the estate will be nearly evenly divided between those entities. Primary Wave bought out all or most of the interests of Prince’s three youngest siblings one of whom has died. The three older siblings last year transferred an undisclosed portion of their stake to McMillan a veteran entertainment attorney and musician-producer Charles Spicer who have represented them in estate proceedings.

The IRS and Comerica settled last spring on the real-estate assets of the estate but the valuing assets such as the rights to Prince’s music was far more complicated and not completed until October according to the report.

As part of the agreement the IRS dropped a $6.4 million “accuracy-related penalty” it had levied on the estate; the Minnesota Department of Revenue dropped its accuracy penalty as well.

According to the report tens of millions of dollars will be taken from the estate in taxes. Slightly more than $5 million of the estate will be exempted from taxes under federal law but thereafter the tax rate is 40%. In Minnesota the first $3 million is tax-exempt; after that much of Prince’s estate will likely be taxed at 16 %.

The Internal Revenue Service and the estate's administrator Comerica Bank and Trust have agreed to a value of $156.4 million a figure that the heirs to the estate have also accepted according to Minnesota's Star Tribune.

The final valuation exceeds the $82.3 million valuation initially submitted by Comerica. The IRS determined earlier this year that executors of the pop icon's estate undervalued it by 50 percent estimating $163.2 million instead in court filings.

The estate will be divided between three of Prince's oldest siblings and Primary Wave an independent music publishing and talent management company that purchased the interests of the music icon's younger siblings.

Charles F. Spicer Jr. court appointed advisor for the remaining heirs of the estate confirmed the valuation to EW adding that the family is thrilled that the extensive legal battle has reached a conclusion.

""We're looking out for the best interest of fans [and] ensure that Prince's legacy remains for generations to come"" Spicer said. EW has reached out to the IRS and Comerica Bank and Trust for comment.

The IRS and Comerica settled on the real-estate portion of Prince's estate last spring but still had to contend with trickier valuations of more abstract assets including rights to Prince's music. Comerica initially requested a trial over the valuation issues but called the $156.4 million settlement ""fair and reasonable"" on Friday.

Had Comerica and the IRS gone to trial the settlement decision would have been prolonged resulting in more legal fees for the estate; Sharon Nelson one of Prince's half-siblings previously lambasted Comerica over their ""thousands of court filings"" that cost the estate ""millions in legal fees"" while speaking to Billboard in 2019.

In 2020 the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had also provided an estimate of $163.2million. Now according to The Minneapolis Star-Tribune the six-year legal battle over the pop superstar’s assets has come to an end with both organisations reaching a final agreement on its worth.

Prince – who died in 2016 from a fentanyl overdose leaving no will – had six sibling heirs two of whom Alfred Jackson and John R. Nelson have since died. Two others are currently in their eighties. Since the passing of the ‘Purple Rain’ star millions of dollars have been paid to administer his estate and provide a plan for its distribution.

The heirs have reportedly accepted the final figure.

In Carver County District Court last Friday (January 14) where the value of the settlement was disclosed in a filing at probate court L. Londell McMillan attorney for three of Prince’s siblings said: “It’s been a long six years.”

The estate will be divided as early as February evenly distributed between New York music company Primary Wave and the three oldest of Prince’s heirs and their families.

Taxes on the estate are expected to run into the tens of millions. Just over $5million of Prince’s estate will be exempt from tax under US federal law however after that the rate is 40 per cent. In the state of Minnesota the first $3million is tax-exempt with the remaining amount then taxed at 16 per cent.

The “accuracy-related penalty” the IRS had imposed on the estate has been dropped as part of the agreement as has the same penalty issued by The Minnesota Department of Revenue according to the filing.

Comerica sued the IRS in US Tax Court claiming the IRS’ calculations were “full of errors”. The tax trial set for March has been cancelled because of the settlement.

Comerica said that while the IRS’ settlement was “fair and reasonable” they believe they would have “prevailed” in the tax court case instructing Prince’s heirs to continue pressing the IRS and if required to go to trial if they believe lowering of estate taxes would be in their “primary interest”.

Produce growers on the West Coast are paying nearly triple trucking rates according to Reuters.

On the East Coast snow and ice storms have created massive food delivery delays.

Grocery stores and other retailers face a 12 percent out-of-stock level on many household staples compared to 7-10 percent in regular times.

Compounding the problem is inflation. The rate jumped 7 percent since December 2020 according to CBS News.

Birds Eye frozen vegetable maker Conagra Brands’ CEO Sean Connolly told investors its supplies might be hampered for at least a month because of too many sick workers.

The problem is just not isolated to produce. For example Costco imposed purchase limits on toilet paper at some stores in Washington state.

Katie Denis vice president of communications and research at the Consumer Brands Association blames the shortages on lack of labor and expects the situation to continue for at least a few more weeks.

Coffee has come a long way baby. Unless you're a boomer or beyond (beyonder?) you are probably unaware of a time when the options for partaking of a cup of joe were pretty much black and ""regular"" (with cream and sugar in New England per Boston.com). And ""cream"" meant just that: cream. Carnation's Coffee-mate non-dairy creamer was launched in 1961 according to Americano Goodies and purchased by Nestlé in 1985 (via Nestlé's About page). The company started selling Starbucks coffee creamers in 2019 (via the Nestlé website) and leads the pack in the creamer arena with $360 million in sales annually per Statista. International Delight is the second leading flavored coffee creamer brand with $158 million in sales despite having been according to its website the first company to start selling ""flavored liquid non-dairy creamers"" in 1980. It entered the market with just three flavors. Can you imagine?

Today's coffeescape is a veritable carnival of creations. ""Younger"" coffee drinkers (those who probably don't know anyone who was at Woodstock) are riding the specialty coffee wave that began in the '60s per PBS. According to Daniel Jhung president of Nestlé's beverage division they aren't black coffee drinkers but really more into the ""coffee milkshake"" vibe as reported by Wall Street Journal. International Delight's latest foray into the fun and flavorful realm of coffee creamers is a Willy Wonka-inspired concoction that surely springs from a world of pure imagination and boasts a Wonka-esque twist to boot.",,,,,,,,,

Canada’s largest oilsands companies have formed a new advocacy group they say will help to advance the sustainable development and operation of their industry.

The Oil Sands Alliance was established Jan. 1 with membership consisting of oil sands producers Suncor Energy Inc. Cenovus Energy Inc. Imperial Energy Ltd. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and ConocoPhillips.

It is not clear whether the new organization will be involved in political lobbying or how exactly it will be structured.

Al Reid director of the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero alliance — which along with other already existing groups like the Oil Sands Community Alliance (OSCA) Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) and the Regional Oil Sands Operating Alliance will be overseen by the new organization — said more details will be released soon.

However he said all of the companies involved in the new Oil Sands Alliance will remain active members of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers the broader industry organization that is the country’s largest oil and gas lobby group.

While CAPP will continue to have the broader mandate for oil and gas advocacy for Canada’s oil and gas producers the new Oil Sands Alliance will “lead the work related to the oilsands.”

“As Canada’s largest oil resource the oilsands have challenges and opportunities that are unique within the broader oil and natural gas industry” Reid said in an emailed statement. “We know this requires a level of concentration and work that requires the specialized focus of our own industry group.”

Reid described the level of collaboration between oilsands producers right now as “unprecedented.” Through the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero initiative — announced last year by the same companies that make up the new Oil Sands Alliance (as well as MEG Energy Inc. which is not involved in the new group) — major industry players have publicly pledged to work together to reach the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The industry’s vision of getting to that goal is anchored by a proposed major carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) transportation line that would capture CO2 from oilsands facilities and transport it to a storage facility near Cold Lake Alta.

CCUS is a technology that captures greenhouse gas emissions from industrial sources and stores them deep in the ground to prevent them from being released into the atmosphere.

Proponents say vastly scaling up CCUS across the oil and gas industry will be necessary if Canada is to have a shot at meeting its climate targets. The federal government has proposed a tax credit for CCUS projects and oilsands producers have been in talks with Ottawa over the details of that credit.

In December Cenovus chief executive Alex Pourbaix said on a conference call with analysts and reporters that CCUS is not at this point an economic technology on its own and that any wide-scale adoption by industry will require “significant government support.”

In an interview Friday Greenpeace Canada senior energy strategist Keith Stewart said it’s clear that oilsands players have gone all-in on “net zero” and the creation of the new advocacy group is likely aimed at helping to advance that messaging and securing government support for carbon capture projects.

But Stewart said the problem with the term “net zero” is that the companies are talking about reducing net emissions from their operations not curbing their overall production of fossil fuels.

“I don’t think anyone should be confused by this particular coat of green paint” Stewart said of the newly formed industry group “until they actually change their business plan to align with getting off fossil fuels in the coming decades.”

It’s been a year since we cracked the story that Charles Pan-Fried Chicken the best fried chicken in the city foodies say — nay in the world! — is opening at 144-146 West 72nd Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues. We waited patiently wondering where we were in the pecking order knowing that proprietor Charles Gabriel is also opening a new spot on 145th Street and Edgecombe Avenue.

Praise the chicken god we’re next — and it won’t be long. WSR received the following update from Quie Slobert Chief Operating Officer of Charles Pan-Fried Chicken who wrote:

Thank you for your interest we would love to be open today but due to the city being backed up with providing permits and waiting on Con Ed approvals we are on hold at this time. A rough guess for opening the 72nd Street location is mid-February. For 145th we are working with Con Edison to build a new gas line due to new building codes so at this time we can’t give even a rough guess.

All of which are dim and hard to recognize let alone fine in their part of the sky.

Cetus means “whale” in Latin. This is the same creature that attacked Andromeda. It could have been a whale or a mystical sea-monster no one is quite sure. It isn’t easy to make Cetus the sky-creature into a whale; he has a fan-shaped head and a bell-shaped lower end. The “clapper” of the bell or tail of the animal is where you’ll find the constellation’s brightest star Diphda. I’m really not sure how to pronounce that properly.

In the throat of Cetus is the star called Mira “the wonderful” (in Latin). Mira can only be seen a few weeks of the year not because it is below the horizon or behind a tree but because it is a variable star and becomes so dim most of the year that one finds it too difficult to locate until it brightens up again for those few weeks. Mira was the first variable star to be discovered back in 1638 by Johannes Holwards. So good luck finding Mira you just have to know when to look for it.

So what is a variable star anyway? Well this one I had to look up. Thank goodness for my trusty set of encyclopedias. Where would I be without them? I must admit that my set is getting kind of old. In the front of the book it says 1936 I’m guessing that was the year it was published. Oops pages 27 through 96 of volume T just fell out. Maybe I should invest in a new set. Does anyone know where I could purchase a new set or at least one a little newer than mine? Please let me know.

A variable star is quite simply a star that changes brightness. A star is considered variable if its apparent magnitude (brightness) is altered in any way from our view on Earth. These changes can occur over years or just in seconds More than 100000 variable stars are known and have been catalogued with thousands more suspected variables out there. Our own sun is a variable star; its energy output varies by approximately 0.1 percent or one-thousandth of its magnitude over an 11-year solar cycle. At the end of that 11 year period is when we have the majority of Sun Spots.

Now you want to know how does a star such as Mira vary in magnitude unlike most stars we know of? Doesn’t anyone here have their own set of encyclopedias? Come on people you’d better keep up with the times.

There are a number of reasons for variability. These include changes in star luminosity or in star mass and obstructions in the amount of light that reaches Earth. Pulsating variables swell and shrink. Eclipsing binaries get dimmer when a companion star or one or more of those suns planets moves in front then brighten as the occulting object moves away. Some of the identified variable stars are actually two very close stars that exchange mass when one takes atmosphere from the other.

I didn’t have the time to go into the different categories of variable stars here today but if you are interested to learn more look up in your trusty encyclopedia “Intrinsic and Extrinsic Variables”. Quite interesting. Hope you all are having a good year so far. Clear Skies….

Tayfun Ozberk story with additional reporting by Xavier Vavasseur

During his presentation at the symposium Captain Smith emphasized that the Constellation-class is a frigate not a destroyer and that it should not be expected to carry the same weapon load as DDGs. However he highlighted that the new frigates will relieve DDGs by performing escort missions to protect high-value assets.

“This is primarily an ASW platform. That’s why ASW is listed first among the missions [of the ship followed by] surface warfare electromagnetic maneuver warfare and air warfare. In a lot of ways it is like a DDG it just doesn’t have all the magazine capacity it doesn’t have all the armament you would expect of a DDG.

This is a frigate.

Now it’s an agile multi-mission platform just like a DDG and it’s going to be dual purpose: For things like escort missions for high value units it’s going to take a lot of the the work off of the DDGs and the cruisers out there today and really focus on if anybody here is Old Navy what did the frigates do ? They did a lot of escort missions you know high value unit protection those kinds of things. They can also steam independently they can steam integrated with a task force it could be a SAG (surface action group) or they could go out and do things with respect to the high value and escort.”



CAPT Kevin Smith program manager (PMS 515)

Captain Smith stated that the program for which the contract was awarded to Fincantieri Marinette Marine back in April 2020 is currently in the detailed design phase. He emphasized that they are working not only on the ship’s primary components such as the AEGIS combat system baseline 10 but also on the ship’s subsystems such as electrical infrastructure piping firefighting systems and so on.

The latest renderings of the Constellation-class frigates (Screenshot from the presentation slides)

Construction to begin later than initially planned

The Secretary of the Navy has already named the first three ships Constellation (FFG-62) Congress (FFG-63) and Chesapeake (FFG-64). Fincantieri has been awarded two of those ships. In terms of the President’s budget focus areas the third ship the future USS Chesapeake is an exercise option that they will consider this fiscal year (2022). Concerning the project’s timeframe the current agenda on the slides is as follows:

FY22 Focus Areas:

– Completing Frigate Class Detail Design:

• Critical Design Review (CDR) 2QFY22

– Start Lead Ship (FFG 62) Construction:

• Production Readiness Review (PRR) 3QFY22

– Continue AEGIS Combat System Development and Integration efforts

– Complete Fincantieri Capital Improvement Projects at Marinette and Sturgeon Bay

– Continue Propulsion Land Based Engineering Site (LBES) Development at NSWC Philadelphia

Answering a media question Captain Smith confirmed that he is targeting April 2022 for the start of construction of the lead ship. One year ago Naval News and USNI News reported that the start of construction for FFG-62 was initially set to take place in 2021.

At SNA 2021 the expected milestones for first-in-class ship were listed as follows:

Start of Construction (SOC): Fall of 2021/Q1 FY2022

Keel laying: Q1 FY2023

Launch: Q1 FY2025

Delivery: Q3 FY2026

The second ship of the class was set to begin construction in Q3 FY2022 the third ship in Q3 FY2023 the fourth ship in Q1 FY2024…

Capt Smith gave information on the acquisition approach of the U.S. Navy in this project. He stressed that they didn’t change the design of the ship and stayed stuck to the RFP:

“From a FREMM perspective discounting c4I and discounting the combat system weapons that are all government-furnished equipment. The FREMM came along with hull accommodations that came along with the propulsion plant layout mechanical systems electrical systems and a physical integrated plant. They had to lengthen the hull a little bit. The architecture for the propulsion is very similar to FREMM but we also have US systems and we have different redundancy and different reliability.”



CAPT Kevin Smith program manager (PMS 515)

Capt Smith also revealed some details about Land Based Engineering and Test Site (LBES) issues which aids in the risk reduction of propulsion architecture and operation and control. He stressed that they’re going to be pretty much in the same vicinity as the Flight-III LBES. FFG 62 LBES activities began in FY2021 in order to support planned initial operational capability (IOC) for the class in FY2029. The U.S. Navy is on target to begin procurement of long-lead time plant components and test equipment Q2 FY2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbnRvbnJlcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAxLzE2L2hvdy1wYWNlLWZpbmFuY2luZy1iZWluZy11c2VkLXN0YXJrLzkxMTAwOTAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How is PACE financing being used in Stark?,"Two developments in Canton and one in Jackson Township are using an innovative way to finance energy-efficient projects.

The DoubleTree by Hilton the Greens at Belden and the Hall of Fame Village's Constellation Center for Excellence all use property assessed clean energy (PACE) financing. It was first used by DoubleTree in 2020 and could be increasingly used by future developments.

""I believe the Stark Metro Housing Authority is looking into using PACE on their City View project"" Canton's Deputy Mayor Fonda Williams said in an email about renovations at the former McKinley Park Apartments.

The property owner typically receives a fixed low-interest loan to pay for energy-saving projects — such as high-efficiency HVAC and LED lighting. The owner then repays the loan in installments as part of its property tax payments.

The financing arrangement does not decrease or defer property taxes and ""is strictly a loan"" Williams said.

Randy Gonzalez economic development director and fiscal officer for Jackson Township said it's a beneficial tool in tough times.

""It helps development in the area because it helps get financing for the companies that are coming in especially during and what took place with the pandemic"" he said. ""Financing got froze up in some areas.""

The PACE framework originated with a 2009 White House initiative to encourage renewable and efficient energy use. A number of states have adopted PACE programs as Ohio did soon after.

How does it work?

State law requires a property owner and local government to first create an energy special improvement district (ESID) which encompasses the property or properties with improvement projects.

Canton and the Hall of Fame Village which owns the DoubleTree and Center for Excellence properties established the Canton Regional Special Energy Improvement District in the summer of 2020 for the hotel. They added the Center for Excellence to the ESID in November 2021.

In June 2021 Jackson Township established the Stark County Energy Special Improvement District with ABC Gardens to redevelop the former Tam O'Shanter Golf Course into the Greens at Belden.

Each ESID is governed by a nonprofit corporation with a board of directors that administers PACE financing. The board must have at least five members — various representatives for the property owners and two representatives from the local government or governments.

The relevant ESID and local government approve PACE financing requests said Michael Vaccaro administrator and law director for Jackson Township. Only property owners who voluntarily participate have a special assessment levied on their property.

""The amount of the special assessments and their payment terms are determined by the property owner and the PACE capital provider and presented to the local government for approval"" Vaccaro said in an email.

The assessments which account for interest help secure and repay up-front capital for energy-efficient improvements. The money can come from municipal bonds a bond-issuing organization like port authorities or a bank or lender.

Property owners also pay the ESID board an administrative fee which is determined by the lender and takes into consideration the funds needed creditworthiness and overall project Williams said.

""Oftentimes if the project is $1 million or less it is not worth utilizing PACE financing because the fees are high"" he said. ""It really depends on who is providing the funding.""

Stark County's existing ESID projects consist of:

A maximum assessment of $6.18 million for the DoubleTree by Hilton. The Hall of Fame Village is expected to make semi-annual payments for up to 20 years.

A $16.2 million assessment for an estimated $7.5 million in energy improvement projects at the Hall of Fame Village's Constellation Center for Excellence. The owners will make semi-annual payments for 25 years.

A maximum assessment of $16.4 million for the Greens at Belden. ABC Gardens is expected to make semi-annual payments for up to 20 years.

What upgrades are eligible?

Canton and Jackson Township's ESID legislation is commercial in nature.

In some places residential projects are permitted. However residential programs have faced reports of predatory lending and other issues.

The Ohio Revised Code describes a ""special energy improvement project"" as the means and methods to create solar geothermal and customer-generated projects or an energy-efficiency improvement.

""Customer-generated projects"" involve generating electricity with wind organic material or the process of gasification. ""Energy-efficiency improvements"" are permanently installed technologies products and activities that reduce the demand or consumption of energy or produce ""clean"" renewable energy according to state law.

Some of the improvements authorized for the DoubleTree Greens at Belden and Center for Excellence include:

New LED lighting

New hot water boilers

Occupancy sensors connected to a light dimmer switch

Programmable smart thermostats

Insulation improvements to windows exterior walls and roofs

HVAC components with higher energy-efficiency ratings

Why use PACE financing?

According to the articles of incorporation for Canton and Jackson Township ESIDs the aim is to enhance ""public health safety peace convenience and welfare"" by assisting with the development of projects that ""reduce the territory's carbon footprint promote the district as a location for green technology job creation benefit property within the district and improve the environment.""

Gonzalez said he hopes more developments such as the planned Costco Wholesale on Frank Avenue NW consider using PACE financing.

""It seems to be a really good program. I think energy conservation is going to be obviously ... bigger and bigger every year just because of the cost of energy"" he said.

Vaccaro said it's often a ""winning solution"" for all involved. Property owners receive low-interest rates the ability to transfer the assessment with a property sale and the option to pass costs on to tenants who benefit from ""improved building environment and lower utility bills.""

""PACE capital providers benefit from the strong security that comes with assessment financing. Senior lenders benefit from investment in their collateral the more diversified capital stack and the fact that PACE assessments cannot be accelerated"" Vaccaro stated. ""And local governments benefit from the ability to facilitate sustainable investment and economic development without pledging any governmental resources or abating or diverting any existing taxes.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vd2lraXMvZ2Vuc2hpbi1pbXBhY3QvVGhvbWFfR3VpZGVfLV9CZXN0X0J1aWxkc19hbmRfVGlwc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thoma Guide - Best Builds and Tips - Genshin Impact Guide,"Type Name Effect

The body was removed from the home by the Steuben County Coroner's Office Davies said. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation.

As a market development manager at Corning she builds relationships and works with people and employs those same skills while volunteering in the Wilmington community.

When she arrived in Wilmington in 2010 due to her husband’s job and the folding of a family business she looked for a place to land herself.

“I banked with CCU and upon relocating applied and accepted a position starting out as a member service representative” she says. Most of her time at CCU has been spent as a branch operations supervisor until she accepted the role of market development manager in February 2019.

After settling professionally Troccia was on the hunt for a way to get involved.

“When I first moved to Wilmington I noticed right away that the people I was connecting with were passionate about giving back and volunteering” she says. “I wanted to get involved but I didn’t know where to start.”

An opportunity presented itself when Corning decided to participate in a United Way corporate campaign. That began a relationship.

“I had the opportunity to learn about the United Way and the area nonprofits they serve” she says. A few years later she was asked to join the campaign committee and she has now have served on the cabinet for several years.

Troccia was amazed by the passion and dedication of the United Way staff. This was particularly evident after Hurricane Florence. “That was the moment when I knew I had found my place and wanted to get more involved” she says. “They stepped up and were here for our community in such a big way when we needed it most and their own needs were put aside to serve others.”

She has been selected to serve as the chair of the campaign cabinet starting in June of 2022 and is anxious to see where this year takes the organization.

Additionally she and her team at work enjoy volunteering together at various nonprofits in the Cape Fear area. They participate in several annual initiatives such as Salvation Army Angel Tree Stuff the Bus and Work on Wilmington.

And yet the volunteering does not stop there for Troccia. Applying interviewing skills she uses at work she conducts mock interviews at Step Up Wilmington. “I wanted to use my strength to help others” she says. You can also add Nourish NC to her list of charities. “Once I learned about its backpack program I was hooked” she says. “As our area continues to grow in population food insecurity becomes an even bigger concern and Nourish NC is doing everything that they can to fight hunger in our area.”

After a day of work and helping out in the community it is evident that neither takes its toll. “When you are passionate about something it doesn’t feel like work” Troccia says.

Quite expectedly the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G looks just like the Galaxy S21 bunch but with a twist. The phone has a flat front a thin metal frame and a slightly curved back that flows into the raised camera block. And that's where it differs!

Galaxy S21 next to the Galaxy S21 FE

See while the metal frame of the Galaxy S21 flowed into the jutting-out camera slab Samsung did the opposite here - the plastic back seamlessly flows into a camera island. And while it may seem like the maker chose the cheaper option we think this looks more organic at least from an aesthetic perspective.

The build is identical to the Galaxy S21 as well - there is a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus at the front the frame is brushed aluminum and the back is a piece of grippy plastic with a matte finish. The S21 FE is water and dust resistant with the same IP68 rating as the rest of the S21 series.

Galaxy S21 next to the Galaxy S21 FE

And while we are still looking at the two most compact S21 members let's compare them. The Galaxy S21 packs a 6.2-inch display while the S21 FE utilizes a slightly larger 6.4-inch panel. The FE version is obviously larger - it's 4mm taller 3mm wider and 8 grams heavier than the original S21 model. We consider both phones pocket-friendly by today's standards. Sure not as compact as an iPhone mini but still among the smallest premium Androids around - especially if you count the three separate cameras.

We do like this natural flowing design of the Galaxy S21 lineup and the S21 FE in particular. It is good-looking and it does prove firmer grip than your average dual-glass smartphone.

Now let's take a closer look at the Galaxy S21 FE 5G.

As we've established the Galaxy S21 FE 5G employs a bit smaller 6.4-inch display than the previous S20 Fan Edition. It has the usual circular perforation for the 32MP selfie camera around the top just below the earpiece. The screen panel has been improved since the S20 FE with native HDR10+ support at launch.

There is no grille above the screen just a thin outlet for the sound. There is a proper speaker placed underneath the display right next to the selfie camera. It also acts as an earpiece. The Galaxy S21 FE has stereo speakers - this is one of them while the other one is at the bottom next to the USB port.

Another thing that's invisible to the naked eye is the under-display fingerprint scanner. It's a Goodix optical sensor unlike Galaxy S21's ultrasonic eye (by Qualcomm). It is reasonably fast accurate and reliable and overall we are happy with the experience.

And before we flip over to the back we should acknowledge the evenly thin screen bezels.

The back is one nicely smooth piece of plastic and Samsung calls its design a Contour Cut one. It is mostly flat with slightly curved edges then it rises a bit to envelop the three cameras. The result is indeed one simple and beautiful panel with no abrupt endings or transitions.

We've already seen these three rear cameras - they are the same as on the Galaxy S20 FE. There is a 12MP primary shooter a 12MP ultrawide one and an 8MP 3x telephoto.

While the rear panel is made of plastic it does not feel cheap or hollow. Interestingly it's not a smudge magnet either just on the contrary. Even on our Graphite version here fingerprints are barely visible if at all.

All Galaxy S21 FE color options

The aluminum frame is slightly curved and brushed matching the touch and feeling of the back. It provides good enough grip and looks stylish too.

There is nothing but a secondary mic on its top. The bottom has the primary mic the dual-SIM tray the USB-C port and the second speaker.

The left side is completely bare while the right one houses the volume and the power/lock keys.

Handling the Galaxy S21 FE 5G was a pleasure during our week with the phone. It is a grippy device which is rare these days and then it's not a large handset - something that's even rarer.

And we will remember it exactly for those things - a no-nonsense clean design with pocket-friendly size and good grip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoYXRtb2JpbGUuY29tLnBrL3NhbXN1bmctZ2FsYXh5LXMyMi1zZXJpZXMtdG8tdXNlLW5ldy1nb3JpbGxhLWdsYXNzLXZpY3R1cy1hY3Jvc3MtdGhlLWJvYXJkLW5ld3MtMjc4NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung Galaxy S22 Series to Use New Gorilla Glass Victus+ Across the Board,"Faisal Rasool January 15 2022

Gorilla Glass Victus that came out last year proved to be Corning’s toughest glass yet. With up to 4x better scratch resistance and drop protection up to 2 meters it is easily more durable than every comparable aluminosilicate on the market. So it was no surprise when Samsung used it on their premium Galaxy S21 line. And Corning is taking this victory a step further with Gorilla Glass Victus+ this year. And once again we’ll see Samsung’s flagship S22 series rocking this new glass shield.





The industry leaker Ice Universe tweeted that all three Galaxy S22 phones — the Samsung Galaxy S22 S22+ and S22 Ultra — adopt the upcoming Gorilla Glass Victus+. Corning hasn’t launched the Victus+ yet but scratch resistance was a big highlight of the original Victus so we expect more gains in that department.

While the Galaxy S21+ and S21 Ultra were crafted from a glass sandwich the standard S21 used plastic for its casing. The last Galaxy Note 20 also had a polycarbonate back. But that seems to be a brief blip because Samsung is reportedly reverting to glass shells for all Galaxy S22 phones.







Ice Universe doesn’t specify it but if the past trends are anything to go by you can expect the Gorilla Glass Victus+ on both the front and back of these new Samsung Galaxy mobile phones. However the glass shield isn’t the only component Corning supplies to the Korean phone maker.

The Samsung x Corning partnership extends to the ‘Super Clear Glass’ on the S22 Ultra camera. This so-called Super Clear Glass was first pointed out in a leaked marketing infographic. It’s meant to reduce glare ghosting and distortion in imaging. We’ll find out more when the Galaxy S22 series debuts on February 8.

The New Zealand-born actress 44 revealed that she often had to audition against her Yellowjackets costar Christina Ricci earlier in their careers in a recent interview with Rolling Stone.

""She usually got them"" Lynskey noted of Ricci 41 while discussing their hit Showtime series which received an early season 2 renewal last month.

Lynskey revealed that 1996's The Craft and The Crucible were some of the first films she auditioned for after her breakout role in 1994's Heavenly Creatures before going on to appear in Ever After (1998). ""It was the mid-Nineties and there was a look that was popular and it wasn't this chubby dark-haired New Zealander"" Lynskey said.

Lynskey stars in Yellowjackets alongside Ricci Juliette Lewis and Tawny Cypress as a group of women forever bonded by a 1996 plane crash that left their high school soccer team stranded in the Canadian wilderness for 19 months. The show also features Sophie Nélisse Samantha Hanratty Sophie Thatcher and Jasmin Savoy Brown as their teenage counterparts respectively as well as Ella Purnell Liv Hewson Courtney Eaton and Steven Krueger.

The Sweet Home Alabama actress also revealed that a member of Yellowjackets' production team body-shamed her. ""They were asking me 'What do you plan to do? I'm sure the producers will get you a trainer. They'd love to help you with this'"" Lynskey said noting that Ricci Lewis 48 and Cypress 45 came together to support her with Lewis writing a letter to the producers on her behalf.

""It was really important to me for [my character Shauna] to not ever comment on my body to not have me putting a dress on and being like 'I wish I looked a bit better'"" Lynskey added. ""I did find it important that this character is just comfortable and sexual and not thinking or talking about it because I want women to be able to watch it and be like 'Wow she looks like me and nobody's saying she's the fat one.' That representation is important.""

Lynskey previously opened up to PEOPLE about the pressures of trying to live up to the image of a typical Hollywood leading lady. ""I was losing my mind trying to conform to something that was not physically possible for me"" she said in 2016.

""I was very unwell for a long time. I had eating issues and at a certain point I was like 'I'm not going to survive' — not like I was on death's door or anything"" she explained. ""But I was so unhappy and my hair was falling out.""

""I was like 'I just need to look the way I'm supposed to look' and have faith that people are going to want to put someone in a film or on a show who looks like this. I did have to truly become comfortable with myself because you can't fake it"" Lynskey added.

Council communications from Tuesday’s meeting which provides background on agenda items said that the project has been put out for bid. The bids received “were quite a bit higher than the original estimates.”

The hard cost difference to the city is roughly $2.5 million. The original estimated cost in November of 2020 was $12530953 with the newly estimated cost projected at $15024268. Longmont Chief Financial Officer Jim Golden explained that if it’s approved by council the difference will be funded by about $1.47 million of American Rescue Project Act funds and more than $1 million in sales tax from the Harvest Junction East Fund which the city authorized in 2020.

The 150000-square-foot Costco retail warehouse is slated to be built east of Harvest Junction South near the intersection of Ken Pratt Boulevard and South Martin Street. Longmont City Council members in December of 2020 approved an incentives and agreements package for the project that will bring the store and fueling station on 17 acres to fruition. With the inflated prices the city would paying $10861534 in costs to “essentially incentivize” Costco to locate in Longmont.

The project includes an adjacent 9-acre neighboring property that the city plans to use to develop affordable housing. The city will also contribute $4162735 for the affordable housing project which will be a separate aspect of the development.

The project involves a public-private partnership between Longmont Costco Wholesale Corp. and the Goldens a longtime Longmont family that owns Diamond G Concrete Co. The concrete company owns the 26 acres proposed for the store and affordable housing. Jim Golden the city’s chief financial officer is not a member of the Golden family.

In an email Friday Jim Angstadt city director of engineering services said that construction on the Costco is targeted to begin in April with the current schedule projecting the store will open in the second half of 2023.

According to the communications factors in the price increase included “significant fluctuations in pricing for materials” with costs for PVC pipe steel wood and concrete rising by more than 30% over the past year. Additionally increased activity in the construction market in the Denver area and Front Range have led to labor shortages which communications said has also contributed to the increase.

Angstadt said based on the recent trend of increasing project costs the changes weren’t unexpected. He said city staff doesn’t anticipate that the cost would go up drastically again.

“The original project costs were based upon high level estimates” Angstadt wrote. “The current project costs are based upon pricing from contractors through a bidding process so the project team believes that any future cost increased will be minimal.”

As a precaution a 10% contingency has been factored into the new cost city staff said.

The city expects the Costco project to net roughly $4.06 million in sales tax in its first year of operation and more than $3 million in net new sales tax annually.

The Longmont City Council will host its next meeting at 7 p.m. Jan. 25. The meetings are remote due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.

With cold temperatures and winter weather currently plaguing many parts of the country now might be the perfect time to indulge in your favorite comfort food especially if your go-to feel-good meal is macaroni and cheese. A delectable combination of two ingredients that are well-loved on their own mac and cheese is an excellent way to warm up on a chilly winter day – though we certainly support the notion that the nostalgic dish should be devoured year-round.

Now many of us can probably agree that nothing beats a bowl of homemade macaroni and cheese. However for those that don't have a great deal of time to spend in the kitchen there are plenty of boxed and pre-made options available as well. Mac and cheese lovers that shop at Costco specifically can walk confidently into the beloved big-box retailer knowing they'll find several easy-to-make versions of their favorite cheesy pasta dish including one that is supposedly the best in the world.

It’s no secret that you can shop at Costco and save money but you can also make silly mistakes that don’t pay off. Mistakes you might make include the ones you’ll eventually realize like having to throw out food you couldn’t finish before expiration or reaching the end of your membership year and realizing you didn’t make the most of the fee you paid. But they also could include mistakes you might not ever realize you’re making.

Be Aware: 10 New Items Worth Buying at Costco This Month

Buying the Wrong Membership

“There are two membership options to choose from at Costco — a Gold Star and an Executive Member for $60 and $120 respectively” said consumer analyst Julie Ramhold of DealNews. “The biggest difference in perks for the two memberships is that Executive accounts receive an annual 2% reward on qualified Costco Costco.com and Costco Travel purchases. But if you aren’t spending enough to make that reward worth it then you may be better off going for the cheaper membership. Executive members will also be able to purchase items for resale and receive more benefits and discounts on select Costco services. The good thing is you can try out an Executive membership and then downgrade if you find it’s not worth it. Many members find they spend enough in a year that the reward certificate basically pays for the membership. But if that’s not the case for you Costco is good about making it easy to drop to the lower tier and you don’t miss out on too much in the long run.”

Not Splitting the Costco Membership Fee

“Because a Costco membership comes with two cards you can split the membership fee with a friend or family member” said Andrew Lokenauth a personal finance expert and CEO of Fluent in Finance.

However the catch is that the person has to be over 18 and reside at the same address which is great if you have a relative or roommate who lives with you. But what if you don’t? As a way around this Costco does allow you to bring up to two guests with you per warehouse visit but the Costco member must pay for the purchases. So you could potentially split the cost of the membership with a friend — although you would not be able to give the friend his or her own card — and plan your Costco shopping trips together. After each shopping trip your friend could reimburse you for his or her portion of the items.

Not Taking Advantage of Costco’s Price-Adjust Policy

“Costco will price adjust any item you purchased at full price and recently went on sale for both in store and online” Lokenauth said. “If your item went on sale within 30 days after you purchased it you can bring your item or receipt back and get a refund for the price difference.”

Although it might not be practical to monitor Costco’s pricing for 30 days following every item you purchase it could pay off to do so for any large Costco purchases you make.

Buying Fresh Produce in Bulk

“It’s so tempting to stock up on fresh produce in bulk at Costco but if you’re a small household or you just don’t have plans for how to use it all you may want to reconsider” Ramhold advised. “While buying a tray of apples or a huge bag of potatoes may be a good deal money-wise if you end up having to throw out produce because it went bad it’s not as good of a deal as it might seem initially.”

It’s smart to have a plan before you go to Costco. For instance even if you plan on eating a big salad every day for lunch and buying bulk produce seems to make sense will you be able to finish all the produce you buy before it expires? Perhaps you can consider splitting bulk food items that have a limited shelf life with a friend or family member so both of you can benefit from the pricing.

Only Considering Brand-Name Wine

“One thing that people absolutely do wrong in the wine aisle is to look for brands that they already know” said Mark Aselstine of Wine Club Reviews. “There’s relatively little wiggle room in wine pricing these days for established brands so you may only save a buck or two buying the Prisoner or Gnarly Head or whatever in the warehouse. Instead of those established names consumers should absolutely look to some of the Kirkland labeled wines because those are half-off or even cheaper compared to their counterparts.”

Aselstine said that oftentimes Costco’s Kirkland-label wine is bottled by winemakers who simply label their own wine for Costco which means that you’re getting a brand-name wine at a much lower price than if you bought it with the brand-name label.

Restricting Yourself to Whatever’s in Your Local Store

“Costco warehouses are huge and have aisles upon aisles of items to shop as well as certain things you can only get in-store” Ramhold said. “But if you’re focusing on what your local warehouse carries you’re missing out. Costco.com has a ton of stuff that may not be in your local store including different clothing styles foods electronics and more. You’ll get way more out of your membership by shopping both in-person and online — be sure to check the ‘what’s new’ and ‘while supplies last’ sections on the website regularly. They feature new products the company has just begun to carry as well as price drops on items they may be trying to clear out.”

Not Checking Prices

Most Costco members joined to take advantage of the low costs on bulk items which is convenient for stocking up for the entire family in fewer trips” said Adam Wood cofounder of Revenue Geeks. “Instead of buying a little bottle of olive oil that would run out quickly you can acquire a two-liter bottle of Kirkland Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil for $15.49 on Costco.com. On Amazon a two-liter bottle of Mantova Extra Virgin Golden Italian Olive Oil costs $19.89. That’s an extra $4.”

However it’s important to always check prices and quantities to make sure you’re getting the best deal. In Woods’ example the two bottles of olive oil are truly the same size so the savings are apparent. But when you’re buying large quantities of items you’ll need to do the math to make sure the per-unit price really is saving you money over buying the same item in a smaller quantity elsewhere.

Ignoring Gift Cards

“Not Costco gift cards — instead I mean gift cards that are for other businesses” Ramhold said. “Costco offers packs of discounted gift cards and depending on the restaurant or store you could save 15% to 25% off the face value of the cards. For instance last year I purchased $200 worth of gift cards to Texas de Brazil (split up into 4 $50 cards) for $150. It’s also not uncommon to see $100 worth of gift cards going for $70 to $80 depending on the restaurant or store they’re for.”

Not Buying Fuel

Gas prices at Costco (or any wholesale club) tend to be significantly lower than those at other local stations (often as much as $0.10-$0.40/gal cheaper)” said Lauren Keys of Trip of a Lifestyle.

Not Using the Return Policy as Needed

Although you don’t want to abuse Costco’s generous return policy you should use it if you need it.

“Since Costco sells such large quantities of their food they don’t want people to be discouraged from trying new things” Keys said. “That’s why they let you return anything at any time including food that’s been opened and even your membership itself! There are a couple of exceptions but Costco’s customer service is unmatched when it comes to guaranteed satisfaction.”

This sense of creeping dread had begun first thing when Nathan Lyon gave a nod to the news cycle in the UK by enjoying a raucous party at No 10. He cracked three sixes – including one that flew into the front yard of a neighbouring house – as the Australian tail wagged completing an impressive turnaround from 12 for three 24 hours earlier to post 303 all out.

It then fully materialised as Pat Cummins spearheaded the latest display of fast-bowling excellence with the pink Kookaburra ball the captain’s figures of four for 45 bowling out England for a sorry 188 in 47.4 overs. But for Chris Woakes offering some resistance from No 8 by top-scoring with 36 – and only then after being dropped on nought and five – plus Sam Billings unfurling some elegant straight drives during a maiden Test innings of 29 this would have been far worse.

After moody salmon skies had made way for pitch darkness overhead a breakneck day ended with Australia closing on 37 for three and a lead of 152 runs.

Stuart Broad completed a pair for David Warner Woakes strangled Marnus Labuschagne down leg for five and Mark Wood bounced out Usman Khawaja with a snorter. But Steve Smith was 17 not out Scott Boland had admirably survived as nightwatchman and Australian sights remained trained on a 4-0 series win.

Talk of Tasmania looking to get full value for their reported A$5m staging fee with a so-called chief executive’s pitch was proved to be bunkum by this 17-wicket bonanza.

There are eight millimetres of rye grass on the Bellerive Oval surface which combined with the vagaries of pink-ball cricket has offered plenty for the seamers. Lyon is the only frontline spinner on show but was yet to be called upon save for his buccaneering 31 with the bat and a diving catch at backward point off Ben Stokes as England lost three for seven in 21 balls during the likely decisive second session.

Australia call their fast bowlers “the cartel” and they delivered a collective performance that sat in contrast to England’s on day one. Cummins set the example – his dismissal of Joe Root lbw for 34 with a beauty that jagged back was arguably the tipping point – and Mitchell Starc playing his fifth successive Test of the series went at five an over but still wiped out three Englishmen along the way.

Then there were Boland and Cameron Green two change bowlers who once again delivered control and hostility for their captain.

Australia received a significant leg-up once Lyon had turned an overnight 241 for six into a total that exceeded anything their guests have mustered all tour. England’s new opening partnership of Zak Crawley and the recalled Rory Burns were separated after 10 balls the former calling a risky single and the latter run out by a bullet throw from Labuschagne at cover.

Burns who had only just got away with an unreviewed edge behind sixth ball had registered his eighth duck in 22 innings. Greater alertness and/or a dive might have saved him.

Crawley was not innocent and his attempts to atone delivered only a couple of the shots witnessed during his 77 in Sydney before Cummins found his inside edge on 18 the ball cannoning into his pad and the first-innings centurion Travis Head snaffling the catch at short-leg.

At 29 for two just before the break Root had once again joined Dawid Malan to begin the latest rescue mission.

'I absolutely loved it': Sam Billings upbeat about batting debut despite England struggle – video

The pair found a similar groove to the third-wicket stands witnessed in Brisbane and Adelaide after the second session got under way. Though Malan enjoyed a similar slice of luck to Burns – an edge behind on 13 off Green not sent upstairs – thoughts of the conditions easing off began to rise. But refreshed after letting the support cast initially resume Cummins then returned in devastating fashion strangling Malan down leg to the wicketkeeper on 25 – a dismissal he was hunting given the leg slip – and then trapping Root in front to leave England 81 for four.

Root’s stated aim of securing a century on Australian soil this series now comes down to one final innings off the mainland but personal milestones remain secondary to the cause.

Sadly for him the cause was soon dented further as Stokes flashed uppishly off Starc on four and Lyon dived to his left for a catch only bettered for athleticism when Ollie Pope snaffled Warner in the same position late on.

Kudos should probably go to Pope for being clear of mind by this stage having been thrust back into the team in the absence of the injured Jonny Bairstow and found himself the sixth England wicket to fall before the second interval.

The irrepressible Boland nagged away outside his off stump eventually found the edge of one of the numerous groping shots offered by the right-hander on 14.

Once Woakes had overcome drops by Warner and Khawaja in the cordon – Boland the bowler twice denied – from 110 for six he managed to chisel out 72 runs across two stands with first the encouragingly unruffled Billings and then Wood who typically scrapped for 16 of them.

But with Billings looking to take on Green and emulate Lyon’s remarkable blows off Wood first thing only to pick out long-leg and Woakes then feathering down leg off Starc the innings evaporated and soon it was back to the day jobs for England’s seldom-rested bowlers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXUuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hc2hlcy0yMDIyLXBhdC1jdW1taW5zLWNsYXNzeS1nZXN0dXJlLWR1cmluZy1jZWxlYnJhdGlvbnMtMjE1MDEzNDIxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pat Cummins' incredibly classy gesture during Ashes celebrations,"Pat Cummins stopped the champagne celebrations so Usman Khawaja could rejoin the party.

Pat Cummins has been hailed around the cricket world after a classy gesture for teammate Usman Khawaja during Australia's Ashes celebrations.

Australia got to celebrate with the Ashes urn after wrapping up the series 4-0 with a 146-run win over England in Hobart on Sunday night.

The Aussies broke out the champagne as they celebrated on the stage with their trophy.

But Khawaja who is Muslim was forced to exit stage left when the champagne started being sprayed around.

Khawaja's religion prevents him from drinking alcohol with Muslim athletes often forced to sit out celebrations involving champagne.

But Cummins showed his leadership on Sunday night when he ordered his players to stop spraying the alcohol so Khawaja could re-join the party.

Video has gone viral on social media showing the moment Cummins told teammates to put the champagne away before gesturing for Khawaja to come back.

Khawaja then jumped back onto the stage right next to his captain as the full team posed for photos.

Journalist Ben Everill tweeted: “Huge shout out for Cummins gesture 2 stop the champagne to get Khawaja back in celebrations!

""That’s an Aussie skipper right there. I’m sure the boys have had plenty since but he ensured inclusiveness.”

Fellow journalist Anand Datla wrote: ""This is small yet significant gesture. Leadership 101. And that should be enough to endear Khawaja to Cummins through the rest of his career.

""Awareness is key particularly in these moments of head spinning success.""

While cricket writer Andrew Wu added: ""Says a lot about Pat Cummins that he had the presence of mind to tell teammates to delay the celebratory spraying of champagne so Usman Khawaja could be involved.""

This is small yet significant gesture. Leadership 101.

Pat Cummins leads Australia to Ashes triumph

Cummins was handed the captaincy on the eve of the series after Tim Paine stepped away from cricket when a sexting saga became public.

Story continues

In a dream series debut as captain Cummins finished as a 4-0 Ashes winner and topped the wicket tally with 21 despite missing one Test.

""That was probably my biggest worry in accepting the role as captain"" Cummins said.

""I'm in the team as a bowler. I want to make sure that's protected and I'm able to perform as well as I'd like.

""I think with each game I felt better at managing that.""

Cummins said he leant on deputy and former skipper Steve Smith to set fields and said he was able to ""switch off"" as captain when bowling.

""I could really ... take off the captain's hat and just be a bowler for my overs"" he said.

""Even little things around bowling changes setting fields in between overs. As I felt like I got better at managing that as the series went on.

""That's a hugely pleasing thing. Again it might be difficult in the heat for longer innings. But I feel like it's something I'm only going to get better at.""

Key Highlights Pat Cummins won the hearts of cricket fans with a heartwarming gesture following the fifth Test Cummins asked his team to keep the champagne away in order to ensure Usman Khawaja can be part of the celebrations Australia won the 2021/22 Ashes with a 4-0 margin

Pat Cummins' could not have asked for a better start to his Test captaincy career as in his debut series in the leadership role Australia defeated arch-rivals England 4-0 in the 2021/22 Ashes series.

Under Cummins' captaincy Australia did not just retain the prestigious urn but also put on a dominating display in which the home side comprehensively defeated Joe Root's men in every game apart from the fourth.

Despite Cummins missing the second game of the series in Adelaide after coming in close contact with a COVID-19 positive person Australia won the first three games of the series comfortably to seal a series win.

Following that the teams played a dramatic draw in Sydney as Australia missed victory by just one wicket on the final day but responded strongly with a 146-run victory in Hobart in the final Test.

However it is after the culmination of the fifth Test that Cummins won the hearts of the cricket community with a heartwarming gesture towards Usman Khawaja in the trophy celebration.

As the Australians were handed the trophy their players were ready to burst open champagne bottles but Cummins signalled them to keep their bottles away and told Usman Khawaja to rejoin the group.

Khawaja made a memorable comeback to Australia's Test team after three years during the fourth match of the series at the Sydney Cricket Ground by scoring a century in both innings.

With Travis Head returning to the side for the Hobart Test Khawaja was asked to open the innings with David Warner but failed to get a big score.

Pat Cummins described winning his first Ashes as Australia captain as “incredible” after his side sealed a 4-0 series victory over England in Hobart.

England were chasing 271 in the day/night game but eventually suffered a 146-run defeat after collapsing from 68 without loss to 124 all out.

“It’s incredible an Ashes series is one you have in your diary for a couple of years” Cummins said.

“They’re the big series that you want to peak at and to be thrown the captaincy beforehand as well I couldn’t have predicated how the last six or seven weeks have gone.

“Everything’s gone to plan. There’s so many positives to take out of it and for this team to be part of Ashes history it’s been phenomenal.”

Cummins was full of praise for Travis Head – who finished the series as leading run scorer – and 22-year-old all-rounder Cameron Green.

He added: “I think someone like Trav Head he’s still seen as one of the younger players but he’s got a hell of a lot of experience in domestic cricket.

“I think being dropped last year and coming back in this year he came back with a real calmness about him a real confidence and you saw that straight away in the Gabba he just played his game and has just really grown.

“Cam Green very similarly. Last summer I thought he showed signs of his potential and this summer he’s really confident.

“I think he grew as a batter and bowler throughout it and he’s just as good as any all-rounder in the world at the moment.”

The Australia captain added that he hopes this Ashes victory is “the beginning” of more success to come for his side.

He added: “This is just hopefully the beginning.

“I feel like we’re in a really good place. There’s no imminent retirees hopefully so hopefully we’re building something big for the next few years.”"

Two of the biggest retail pharmacies in the U.S. are temporarily closing some stores and pharmacies on the weekends as the latest surge in COVID-19 causes staff shortages.

Walgreens said that like many industries this latest surge in the Omicron variant is placing a significant strain on its business in the short-term and driving demand unlike ""anything seen before.""

In a statement to CNN on Friday Walgreens spokesperson Kris Lathan said ""While the vast majority of our stores are open and operating with normal business hours the ongoing labor shortage combined with the surge of COVID-19 cases has resulted in isolated instances in which we've had to adjust operating hours or temporarily close a limited number of stores.""

When making the decision to adjust store hours Lathan said that the company makes every effort to minimize disruption for customers by selecting days with ""the lowest prescription demand."" She added that when the company temporarily closes a store it directs some pharmacy services to the nearest open Walgreens.

CVS said on Friday that the lion's share of its stores are operating on their normal weekend hours according to Mike DeAngelis executive director of CVS Corporate Communications. But he noted that ""a tiny fraction of stores are temporarily closed on one or both days of the weekend to help address acute staffing issues amidst both the omicron surge and the workforce shortage affecting nearly every industry and company.""

The adjusted operating hours in these stores are temporary he said.

Pharmacies closing because of staffing pressures is happening across the country according to Mitchel Rothholz chief of staff at the American Pharmacists Association.

""It's a problem across the whole healthcare system not just in pharmacy"" Rothholz told CNN last month ""but our members are dealing with this constantly now because of the increased demand for testing as well as COVID vaccinations people who are wanting to get the boosters or even getting their first doses.""

She previously performed 52 shows across North America for the tour which was halted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The tour will resume in May with the European and Middle Eastern leg.

Dion previously postponed her new Las Vegas residency which was originally set to open at The Theatre at Resorts World in November. She also cited her muscle spasms which prevent her from performing and remains under treatment by her medical team.

Watt scores touchdown for Pittsburgh Steelers,"The Pittsburgh Steelers are on the scoreboard first in their AFC Super Wild Card game against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead on Sunday.

Pittsburgh’s attack has gone absolutely nowhere so it was up to the defense and the great T.J. Watt to provide instant um offense.

The Chiefs tried to get fancy with a Wildcat play and Mecole Hardman had trouble executing the handoff to Darrel Williams.

The running back bobbled it once was crunched by Cameron Heyward and coughed up the ball again.

T.J. Watt who equaled the NFL record with 22.5 sacks this season was on the spot picked up the ball and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown.

The PAT made it 7-0 for the road team.

It was the first touchdown of T.J. Watt’s career. It tied him with Steeler teammate and brother Derek Watt who has one TD in his career as a fullback.

The sketch begins with SNL freshman James Austin Johnson’s typically confused President Joe Biden blaming COVID on something ridiculous. “When did Spider-Man come out? December 17th. When did every single person get Omicron? The week after December 17th” POTUS points out. “That’s really all I have to say; I yield the remainder of my time to questions.”

Considering that Spider-Man: No Way Home is currently the eighth-highest grossing film of all time maybe he’s not be entirely wrong? Nevertheless a disbelieving press corps peppers him with queries; he deflects them all with “Stop seeing Spider-Man!” He claims it has “a 98 percent on Au Gratin Potatoes” (instead of Rotten Tomatoes); he blames the lack of support for a voting rights bill on Spider-Man; and he pawns off a looming war in Ukraine on … well you know.

Things really take off though when a “nerd” in the press room asks if he thinks there are Joe Bidens from alternate universes – akin to a major plot point from No Way Home. “Finally a good question!” Biden remarks as he launches into a complex theory supported by Doctors Strange and Fauci about him having at least two doppelgangers including one who lost to Trump and now hosts a CNBC show called T-Birds Tacos & Trains.

A bit later cue the smoke machine and out comes Cool Joe Biden (a shirtless Pete Davidson with sunglasses and white hair) who tells the president that he’s actually right. We are all in a joke universe (spawned by the Cubs winning the World Series in 2016 natch) and every single person is better off in Cool Biden’s universe … except well for Pete Davidson. (“Your world is maybe more fun for him.”)

Watch the full video above then tell us if you think SNL‘s Faux Biden wasn’t 100-percent off the mark.

""There was a week period you can look at the sales numbers (and) it was bleak. I think there was a panic in the marketplace. And dealers were shutting down.""

But that sharp downturn didn't last long. By the next month April 2020 signs of life began to reappear especially in under-40-hp tractor sales. Year-over-year sales numbers were rising 10% even 20% in the small-tractor categories. By November 2020 sales of over-100-hp tractors began to show better sales activity.

""You could see signs that the farm economy (considered one of the nation's essential industries) was looking pretty positive"" Blades said. ""So we're reporting these numbers for 2021 tractor sales up 10% and combines up 25%.""

Sales of tractors under 100 hp did began to cool in the second half of 2021. One reason may be that so many tractors were sold in that horsepower range that small-tractor market is satisfied albeit temporarily. Blades said the small-tractor market has been growing for 20 years and he doesn't expect that to end.

Supply disruptions still affect the farm equipment manufacturing. Parts electronics tires steel aluminum transportation and labor shortages all contribute.

""Our supply chain problems are real; I'm not going to diminish them at all they're very real"" Blades said. ""But other markets have fared much worse. There have been very few major shutdowns of (farm equipment) factories. It hasn't been like auto manufacturing where they were shut down for months at a time.""

What about 2022?

Blades is fairly optimistic about continuing strength in tractor and combine sales. ""The farm economy is showing really nice signs of life and growth. However I do have some concerns about the annual cost of inputs"" he said. ""Farmers are paying the fertilizer bills right now and they may have some questions about what the market is going to look like.""

Blades believes farmers are -- or should be -- strategic about their equipment purchases. ""Making a plan for equipment is not a bad thing at all"" he said. ""A half-million-dollar combine shouldn't be an impulse purchase. You should know today whether you need a combine tomorrow or five years from now. We encourage all farmers to work closely with the dealers to kind of build an equipment plan.""

DTN/PF took the opportunity of time with Blades to ask him about one more area -- autonomy. John Deere introduced its autonomous 8R tractor at the CES in Las Vegas two weeks ago. There are other autonomous tractors from other manufacturers already operating in orchards and vineyards on the West Coast and in Midwestern row-crop fields.

What does Blades think about the new era of autonomous farm equipment?

""The industry has got a lot of really cool things going on on the autonomous front"" Blades said. ""Autonomous equipment makes sense. You think of how much auto steer has changed a farmer's operation. You can take those same benefits and take them to next level when you begin to eliminate things like staffing concerns.""

But will autonomy produce a return on investment? Blades thinks so.

He recalled an advertisement that had a tagline ""Cool Costs Money.""

Autonomy is cool he said. ""But this also potentially saves money. And that's what's exciting about autonomy in the ag industry. It actually makes farmers money or saves farmers money.""

The full tractor and combine reports from AEM can be found in the Market Data section of the AEM website under Ag Tractor and Combine Reports.

Three models are being offered and include the STS12 STS16 and STS20. The front boom placement on the STS Sprayer reduces the need for operators to constantly turn and look behind the machine during application. John Deere's AutoTrac RowSense and AutoTrac Vision keep the sprayer in the row for precise product placement. STS Sprayers also feature All Wheel Steer technology that keeps the sprayer's tires in the same set of tracks reducing the potential for crop damage even when making 90-degree headland turns. STS Sprayers have up to 76 inches of underframe clearance so crop disturbance is minimized and the in-wheel suspension of the sprayer provides operators with a smooth ride.

The solution tank is located at the center of the sprayer to balance the weight of the machine whether the tank is full or empty. Three tank sizes are available. The largest is the new 2000-gallon tank for the STS20 that allows the sprayer to work longer between fills.

Almost 90% of the flights out of Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina an American Airlines hub are canceled according to flight tracking site FlightAware. The carrier preemptively canceled 1100 flights Sunday across its mainline and regional operations after canceling 90 Saturday.

“This weekend’s winter storm is expected to have a significant impact on our operation especially at Charlotte International Airport (CLT)” American said in a statement.

The airline also issued a travel notice allowing customers affected by the weather to rebook flights without a fee.

Nearly 74 million people were under winter weather alerts Saturday evening according to the National Weather Service.

The massive storm system is approaching the eastern United States from the Midwest and is expected to form crippling ice in parts of Georgia Virginia and the Carolinas Sunday. The governors of those states have declared emergencies.

“This is by far going to be the biggest issue we encounter over the next 48 hours: ice and a lot of it” CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said Saturday morning.

Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday January 17 is a federal holiday with many schools and offices closed.

American isn’t the only carrier canceling flights. As of 4:30 EST Saturday Southwest canceled 164 flights or 4% of its operations according to FlightAware while Delta Air Lines canceled 153 flights or 7% of its operation.

Other airports in the Southeast also face significant cancellations on Sunday such as Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina has canceled more than half or 74 of its flights that day. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport has canceled 19% or 155 of its flights Sunday.

Saturday saw more than 400 cancellations and 2000 delays in the United States as the storm moves to the South.

It’s been a miserable few weeks to be an airline traveler. Winter weather and Omicron surges left 20000 US flights canceled over the busy holiday travel season. As travel picked up staffing cuts also left airlines with fewer employees than they had before the pandemic.

Users are buying real estate space in the metaverse and can “live” within a virtual universe. Digital avatars can connect through work travel or entertainment using VR headsets.

As the world becomes more virtual with each passing day we are faced with a new challenge about buying digital land. Early December witnessed a massive land grab for virtual real estate. Interest in digital real estate caught everyone’s attention with the recent record $4.3 million purchase of a plot of land in Sandbox. Minecraft Roblox Decentraland and Sandbox are popular platforms offering digital real estate. Since digital real estate does not have any regulations as it exists in a virtual world it can be registered using NFTs.

NFTs or non-fungible tokens have become popular today. These are digital collectibles or unique digital tokens to properties stored on a blockchain ledger. Digital real estate is touted to become a hot commodity shortly soon. Most people use some type of cryptocurrency for transacting in the digital world. Many metaverse games issue their own crypto currency for transacting. During the first week of December ~25% of NFT purchases for digital land in the metaverse were done through NonFungible.com totaling over $300 million. SAND MANA tokens surged in November as crypto traders grew optimistic about the Metaverse. Crypto trading has become a hot opportunity poised to gain from these virtual worlds which are experiencing strong interest from both crypto traders as well as Wall Street. Both crypto traders as well as Wall Street analysts are speculating on the metaverse’s potential commercial value. Many investors are buying the metaverse concept seeing an opportunity like the Bitcoin investment.

Most metaverse cryptocurrencies are built on the Ethereum blockchain e.g. SAND and MANA which are also the largest metaverse cryptocurrencies. Digital land is selling for millions as people scramble to grab virtual real estate in the metaverse which is expected to become a multitrillion-dollar opportunity in the near future. Of course it is highly risky and speculative. NFTs can be purchased using a cryptocurrency held in a digital wallet. Hence cryptocurrencies are becoming indispensable for trading and it is important to learn about crypto trading in a comprehensive way. Websites like easyMarkets offer a good platform for regular crypto trading. The metaverse offers huge opportunities for the cryptonauts out there – offering financial services exchange as well as data storage. However with such massive investments in the virtual world investors will have to wait for their real investment returns which will be based entirely upon land appreciation the economy of metaverse games and their popularity.

The metaverse refers to internet platforms that have built interactive worlds incorporating virtual entertainment and businesses. As of now investing in metaverse land is considered highly speculative. It is possible that your investment in digital real estate becomes worthless or be valued at absurd levels. There are only a limited number of land plots in Sandbox and Decentraland the two biggest metaverse platforms and both the companies have indicated that they will not create more further creating a scarcity.

As of now virtual real estate profits continue to boom both in crypto and fiat currency. Millions of people and institutional buyers are already spending hours a day in virtual social spaces and investing huge amounts to buy a plot of land in the digital world. In June research firm IDC found global shipments of virtual reality headsets surged more than 52% year over year in the first quarter of 2021. Superfast broadband speeds virtual reality headsets and persistent online worlds act as strong growth drivers for the metaverse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL215YnJvYWRiYW5kLmNvLnphL25ld3MvY2xvdWQtaG9zdGluZy80MzAwNzgtd2h5LXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1kYXRhLWNlbnRyZS1jb21wYW55LWlzLXdvcnRoLW92ZXItcjUwLWJpbGxpb24uaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL215YnJvYWRiYW5kLmNvLnphL25ld3MvY2xvdWQtaG9zdGluZy80MzAwNzgtd2h5LXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1kYXRhLWNlbnRyZS1jb21wYW55LWlzLXdvcnRoLW92ZXItcjUwLWJpbGxpb24uaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why South Africa’s biggest data centre company is worth over R50 billion,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://mybroadband.co.za/news/cloud-hosting/430078-why-south-africas-biggest-data-centre-company-is-worth-over-r50-billion.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL215YnJvYWRiYW5kLmNvLnphL25ld3MvY2xvdWQtaG9zdGluZy80MzAwNzgtd2h5LXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1kYXRhLWNlbnRyZS1jb21wYW55LWlzLXdvcnRoLW92ZXItcjUwLWJpbGxpb24uaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL215YnJvYWRiYW5kLmNvLnphL25ld3MvY2xvdWQtaG9zdGluZy80MzAwNzgtd2h5LXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1kYXRhLWNlbnRyZS1jb21wYW55LWlzLXdvcnRoLW92ZXItcjUwLWJpbGxpb24uaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

How about that total digital payment transactions are foreseen to reach $10.50 trillion by 2025? Both of these statistics highlight the fintech industry's rapid growth. However the fintech industry would not be growing without due cause as consumers have reaped significant benefits from various Business-to-Consumer (B2C) fintech businesses. From new credit management strategies to Robo-advisory services consumers are continuously finding new ways to gain control over their finances with the assistance of B2C fintech.

What is a B2C fintech?

Business to Consumer Financial Technology commonly referred to as a B2C fintech provides consumers with products and services that most prominent financial institutions offer. This includes the ability to open bank accounts and credit cards take out loans utilize online payments and focus on personalized financial management. B2C fintech combines all these services under one umbrella differentiating itself as a digital-only business. B2C fintech has been around since the early 2000s but recently saw a wave of new fintech companies open after 2010. Consumers are drawn to these digital-only platforms not only because of creative ways to take control of their finances but also because B2C fintechs can assist underserved consumers through innovative policies and procedures.

How can consumers benefit from B2C fintechs?

Credit management strategies

Credit score dramatically impacts most financial aspects of consumer finances from obtaining a mortgage to a new car loan. The FICO credit score model was introduced in 1989 with major companies like Equifax and Experian pushing the use of the model. B2C fintech companies have realized that the model is outdated and negatively impacts various consumer groups. The first way that B2C fintech companies promote control over consumer finances is by providing accessible and transparent information about current credit scores. For example credit cards like Discover offer free monthly credit reports for users. These apps usually break down the five categories that impact credit scores to show where improvement is needed. Fully understanding the weak areas of one's credit score leads to attainable goals to improve the score. Credit Karma is another example of a fintech company that offers credit monitoring and reports for consumers to aid on the path of financial control.

Access to personal loans

Strong credit management strategies provided by B2C fintech leads to increased access to personal loans for a wide variety of consumers. According to recent studies 19.1 million consumers have personal loans and a whopping 176 million Americans have credit cards. These statistics clearly show the need for personal loan opportunities across the board. So where do B2C fintech companies come into play? Well traditional big-box lenders focus on income levels and outstanding debt while fintech companies aim their attention to the length of employment and other factors not dictated by the FICO credit score model. Prosper is an excellent example of this as they target groups that have been rejected by traditional lenders because of poor credit score factors lending over $5 billion in recent years. This opens up doors of opportunity for underserved classes such as those in poverty or struggling with outstanding debt.

Furthermore many individuals have taken initiatives to consolidate debt through personal loans leading to financial freedom in a shorter period. B2C fintech companies offer consumers innovative consolidated debt approaches through loan consolidation and other lending strategies. Traditional lenders may not be able to give the same opportunities with existing uniform policies in place. Additionally strides towards a stronger financial position give way to other loan opportunities such as purchasing a home or buying a new car. GoRefi has given homeowners the ability to cut out refinancing costs by completely eliminating the middleman showing the benefits of fintech on consumer finances. The doors that open with taking control of your finances are astronomical making it essential to consider all your future loan opportunities.

Quicker payment solutions

B2C fintech goes beyond providing funding to underserved consumer groups. These companies can offer quicker and more efficient payment solutions allowing consumers to stay on top of managing their finances. It's no secret that electronic payments are rapidly changing the way consumer payments are processed with new fintech companies focusing on efficient payment solutions. One such company BillGO allows users to take advantage of quick payments and bill prioritization through a powerful platform host filled with widgets and customizable tools. Other fintech companies like Venmo and Cash App eliminate the need to write checks or go to the bank altogether. Instead consumers can have payments processed electronically frequently posting the same day. This feature allows for real-time information on a checking account or outstanding loan status. The likelihood of bounced checks or missed payments diminishes when consumers have full control over their finances with the tools B2C fintech companies provide.

Real-time access to information

As mentioned before quicker payment solutions with B2C fintech companies lead to real-time access to critical financial information. What exactly is real-time access? Real-time access gives consumers a transparent view of their financial situation at that moment. When payments are processed in real-time they automatically deduct from your bank account and go to the lender immediately. B2C fintech gives users access to real-time information to gain complete control over their finances. Some B2C fintech goes to great lengths to prove to consumers the benefits like Azimo which promises balance transfers in under an hour. Traditional lenders may take days to process and post payments to your account but with a digital fintech company consumers don't have to worry about this. For example say you get paid every Friday and are trying to pay down your debt. You can immediately transfer extra funds to your loan on Friday so your balance is updated going into the weekend. This reduces the risk of overspending because you can see that the money was already taken out of your account.

Efficient personal financial management

We've all heard the terms efficiency and effectiveness but did you know those terms are critical components of managing your finances? B2C fintech is constantly evolving payment methods and available reports to help you stay on top of your finances. Connectivity is a crucial component of financial management leading to the rise of personal finances apps like Mint Personal Capital and Hardbacon. These apps allow their users to track their spending monitor their investments and even compare credit cards giving consumers a one-stop-shop for all things personal financial management. B2C fintech is becoming increasingly popular because of consumers' valuable insight from the apps. We live in an era of technology so why should our banking procedures still be from the 1980s? Simply put they shouldn't. Efficient financial management solutions provided by B2C fintech offer users information to track every detail on their journey to gain control over their finances making them a valuable asset to have.

Stronger banking relationships

Stronger banking relationships are formed when consumers find a banker they can trust and rely on for accuracy. Despite being digital-only companies consumers can still build banking relationships with B2C fintechs. Through multiple communication streams such as live chats and phone calls consumers can find close contact to work with. A relationship with a banker does help consumers on the path to complete financial control. Having a trusted partner to turn to with any questions and receiving special incentives on new loans or accounts are two ways that a banking relationship aids consumers. Consumers often don't have all the answers or know the steps to take to gain control over their finances which is where a B2C fintech expert comes in.

Additionally many large financial institutions are taking steps to implement fintech companies. For example take Zelle which is available through many large banking institutions. As a result you can build a relationship with your local banker and utilize efficient fintech features.

Improved investment technology

We've talked a lot about how B2C fintech companies help control the lending aspect of finances but there are also saving opportunities to be aware of. B2C fintech companies give consumers at every income level the opportunity to invest and save. In addition consumers can track growth with ease through focused efforts on automated advisory services and financial tools that focus on financial management. For example Robinhood is a fintech investment platform that allows users to buy and sell stocks usually commission-free. The integrative features reduce management costs and clearly lay out key information highlighting the impact of fintech on the investment industry.

Moreover free resources are readily available to consumers to help budget invest wisely and work towards future goals all of which focus on gaining and maintaining control over one's finances. Customized portfolios based on individual goals can be easily created by Robo-advisors decreasing advisory fees and increasing financial control. Reducing costs and increasing profit margins through investing are two great solutions to save money for the future or pay down those pesky loans.

What's next for B2C fintechs?

The last decade alone has proven how much an industry can grow in a short period of time. With sales projected to increase dramatically and new startups popping up daily the B2C fintech industry is something to keep on your radar. Consumers can expect to see technological improvements in all aspects of their financial management from new app features to innovative report outputs. In addition the accessibility of B2C fintech companies will become more available to all income levels as competition amongst companies increase. Consumers can use this to their advantage to find the right B2C fintech that caters to their needs. Many B2C fintech companies strive to create a one-stop shop for all things financial management from securing loans to investment opportunities. This centralized hub will cause major shifts in the way consumers derive and utilize their financial information making adaptability a must.

The term Doujinshi is an established part of avid manga readers’ lexicons. The term often pops up in translator’s notes as part of countless series’ origin stories as part of a short story collection or nestled into a beloved series as a bonus chapter. But what exactly is a Doujinshi and how has the format stayed relevant in the modern manga landscape? Simply put Doujinshi is a self-published print publication. They often have a brief page count which is utilized to test the waters on an idea challenge the mangaka or have projects tailored for submission to serialized magazines. Beneath the surface though the format contains great depth seldom explored and a thriving fanbase that’s eager to see everything it has to offer.

The history of the format can be traced back to 1874 when the academic bulletin Meiroku Zasshi coined the term “dojin” a format proposed as an easy way to educate foreigners and spread wisdom about Japanese life. The publication acted to deepen friendship and scholarship with the West throughout the ongoing turbulent relationship with the United States. Though Meiroku Zasshi only ran for about two years the academic bulletin is considered a key document in understanding the Meiji Restoration.

Over the years the format evolved both due to technological advances and social attitudes. Notable advancements such as photocopy turned the format from artistic expressions shared between mangakas to a platform for aspiring creators to mass market their own work—be they parodies of beloved works mature content or original concepts. This accessibility also provided a means for greater representation of marginalized voices within manga  as it granted a way to find an audience. This has never changed the competitive nature of the manga industry nor has it reduced the difficulties that await anyone seeking to become an established artist but Doujinshi has certainly helped bridge that divide between artist and audience.

In the west though the format still largely rests outside of the mainstream. As such the format is often largely unexplored and misunderstood. To help shed some light on the topic I reached out to Matt Haasch at Star Fruit Books and the team behind publisher Irodori Comics to gain a better understanding of what makes these stories appeal to those who are championing Doujinshi as a format.

In asking what makes the format unique Haasch explained that “sometimes [Doujinshi] are stories you normally would not see in traditional magazines or traditional publishers” adding “more experimental different art style or not as long as [a] magazine ‘long shot’ [article]. He notes that as a publisher “it is also neat to be able to work with artists directly.”

The Irodori team agreed explaining that Doujinshi is often the proverbial “front door” to a professional gig. They point out that “with no publisher or editor ‘correcting’ their works Doujinshi artists are able to experiment with unique characters and plots.” Indeed the scene has served as a springboard for many famous manga creators from CLAMP to Yoshitoshi ABe. Some continue to reside in that space such as artist Hiroyuki whose latest work Girlfriend Girlfriend began life as a Doujinshi the English version of which was published by Irodori under the title Two-Timing: Fair and Square. As On Takahashi puts it “the Doujinshi scene really is the ‘indie breeding ground’ of future artists and the ‘free space’ where established authors can release works of their own design.”

Arguably what makes each work such a unique expression lies in the freedom afforded to the mangaka especially when working with Western publishers. Haasch explains that creators “get the final say on what goes out what they like and don’t like.” He continues noting that this approach allows for direct input particularly if “if they have any questions they can ask directly allow them to change art-touch up or bubbles”

As they reflect further on the creative process the Irodori staff muse that mangaka “are not answering to an editor from a major publishing firm. This allows them to exercise a lot of creative freedom and experimentation in their Doujinshi which many artists say they find liberating”.

That said Irodori also noted that the Doujinshi sphere is not always so simple for creators. “They carry all the risk related to independently releasing a work which includes shouldering all costs of production. This means they don’t earn anything unless their work sells well at conventions and the like.” This can cause some degree of trepidation as Irodori’s team spoke of difficulties in building relationships with creators noting that “mangaka tend to treat Doujinshi as very personal projects and are often reluctant to work with external publishers to help localize their work.”

Thankfully this attitude has begun to change as social media has allowed for direct content and the ability for publishers to speak directly to the creators. Haasch explained that reaching new artists has become as simple as looking for recommendations “through friends through different websites [such as] Booth or Pixiv.” And working off of his own tastes and community around the fandom he added that he “will reach out to artists I like see what is trending on Twitter what other artists we currently work with recommend within their own circle.”

Irodori’s approach to sourcing talent includes appealing to their fanbase. They explain that they “hold surveys every now and then and take those responses into consideration when we decide on which authors to approach.” Having expanded their connection overseas they also note that “we also have staff in Japan who attend Doujinshi events to scout authors.” Unsurprisingly the importance of building personal connection between publisher artist and audience is key to establishing a fruitful relationship on all ends of production.

To further establish the potential appeal of the format Doujinshi plays a pivotal role in the Western sentiments for greater representation within the arts. “The Doujinshi format allows authors to tackle LGBTQ themes in ways that commercial publishers might not be as open to” explains Irodori team adding that “having stories that tackle more severe issues linked to LGBTQ identities is important.”

To give a clearer example of the key differences in representation across formats the Irodori staff look to the work of creator Isaki Uta. “We work very closely with Isaki Uta” the team remarks “who has released works about asexuality and transgender identity through “Mine-kun is Asexual” and “Silkscreen” respectively. Both stories don’t exactly work with a ‘happy ending.’” The team stresses the importance of such works stating that “this kind of unique storytelling does ‘go against the grain’ of conventional LGBT Manga in commercial publishing. […] In the case of Isaki Uta their somewhat brutally realistic take on gender and identity issues can’t really be stretched over multiple volumes which makes Doujinshi a perfect medium for their brand of storytelling”.

With this in mind the question remains: how can audiences support the creators? Haasch relates “look at Twitter and follow artists you like.” The Star Fruit Books owner gave a nod to his contemporaries adding that fans should “check out Irodori they have a great selection you can look at for a fair price for both mature and original content.”

Irodori delved a bit deeper stating the importance of also financially supporting artists. “The best ways for fans to support their favorite Doujinshi authors” they explain “is to purchase their works directly be it the original Japanese version from conventions or the localized versions.” They add that “if you want to see more content in English you have to buy the English versions of the works.”

Ultimately given the greater risk to independent publishers though the Irodori team “smaller publishers are more likely to drop a series if they don’t see demand for it.” Ultimately Doujinshi as a format holds many benefits for mangaka while empowering fans to directly support their favorite creators on a financial and creative level. Indeed on a personal level I’ve found myself gaining a profound respect for the medium as I’ve explored alternate narratives that run through various titles. In particular the ways various Doujinshi touched upon the subject of LGBTQIA+ romance were eye-opening to say lightly. Titles like Silkscreen and Toki truly spoke volumes about the universal appeal of the format not to mention their emotional power. This unyielding passion and creative spirit is reflected in the publishers who push to bring Doujinshi to a western audience.

But really what does Doujinshi really mean to those who work on the editorial end of things? To Haasch “ [Doujinshi] means creativity without having to hold back—extremely original content.” The Irodori team echoed this sentiment explaining that to them “Doujinshi is more than just works by fans of a franchise or parody works or hentai publications; rather Doujinshi forms a core element of Anime and Manga culture as a whole.” Indeed it’s impossible to understate the impact that Doujinshi holds on the subculture today though the Irodori team said it best when they stated that “realizing the importance and role that Doujinshi has to play in this industry and what it means to Mangaka as a whole is something we hope to share with others through the work that we do.”

The purpose of the pilot: to help consumers find savings and cashbacks from shops and brands in their neighbourhoods.

The user sign-ups increased 10x in the four months with the app touching 100000 monthly active users in December. It currently has 230000 users 64 percent of whom engaged through the gamified activites on the app according to the company.

""The journey we are supporting is of a person visiting a shop and buying something"" says Amit Sharma Co-founder and CEO of 10i Commerce Services which runs ShopX.

""The reality is most of India's retail economy is still about going to shops and picking up things"" Amit says adding that 94 percent of retail in India entails offline pickups.

It's a startling observation for a seven-year-old company that has already built a robust B2B technology platform to link shops with brands across retail categories.

Building the B2B platform

Founded in 2015 ShopX has scaled up its B2B platform that connected brands with 200000 retailers in more than 500 towns in 24 states. It has active relationships with the top 20 brands in the country across consumer-electronics and FMCG categories Amit says.

Between 2018 and 2020 its operational revenue grew at an astonishing compounded growth rate of 715 percent simply by becoming a marketplace for retailers and electronics brands. It clocked Rs 2963 crore in FY 2020.

But with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 the core team at ShopX reflected on whether it really wanted to continue building a parallel supply chain and logistics system which took it away from their main strength — technology.

""The level of friction in the ecosystem when you build a parallel supply chain is quite high"" Amit says. ""This is manifesting in the distributors’ revolt against eB2B players.""

During the first wave FMCG companies like HUL scaled up their efforts to reach retailers directly through their app like Shikhar.

Distributors and wholesalers then feared that the direct connect between FMCG brands and retailers will sideline their role in the value chain even as more consumers were shopping online than ever before.

""Brands are facing the dilemma that 90 percent of their business goes through distributors and wholesalers while they work with ShopX and other companies"" Amit explains. ""They have to reconcile the margins and the product mix between these channels (trade and digital).""

ShopX has cultivated deep relationships with brands whom they charged a commission and retailers who were the users of its eB2B platform.

What founders Amit and Apoorva Jois proposed to their clients (FMCG and electronics brands) was a SaaS platform that would do three things.

One the B2B technology platform would now be the place for brands to place their messaging and trade schemes to retailers and customise it by region depending on the goals and targets.

The brand could send a trade scheme with a video of the marketing-person attached to it on the eB2B platform which can be viewed in real time by up to 10 lakh retailers.

This feature would help brands save time (four days to a week) and take decisions based on performance of schemes and loyalty programmes.

Two the brands could use the B2B platform to deposit their incentives to retailers instantly. ShopX has developed the payments stack for that facility.

And three the retailers can place their orders digitally on the ShopX platform which would be assigned to the distributor by territory.

For the 250000 retailers on ShopX it makes sense to have one app with many brands rather than the app of each brand across categories.

""Post COVID-19 every brand realises that they need a digitised eB2B supply chain. But their preferred path is to use their existing distributors and wholesalers with the power of technology"" Amit says adding that the wholesalers and distributors are good and efficient with last-mile distribution to retailers.

ShopX charges the brands a subscription fee with pay-per-use for any API-enabled features they need. The venture has thus moved from the transaction-based commission model to a SaaS-based pricing model.

At the backend ShopX has assigned a lean team only for eB2B and platformised the system to take the number of retailers from 200000 to 2 million.

ShopX's shift to B2C

Even as the B2B platform scales the founders and core leadership team trained their focus on the B2C business which took off in September 2021.

Since the pandemic began the number of online shoppers has shot up. India has 140 million online shoppers according to consulting firm Bain & Co. A Kearney Research estimate pegs India's retail market to touch $1.4 trillion by 2026 but online retail is expected to be $140 billion at the most by then.

Players like ﻿Dunzo﻿ ﻿Swiggy﻿ ﻿Zepto﻿ and BlinkIt (erstwhile ﻿Grofers﻿) are doing last-mile delivery of orders even as the first wave of ecommerce companies — ﻿Flipkart﻿ ﻿Bigbasket﻿ and ﻿Amazon﻿— are doubling down on delivery of provisions staples and groceries.

""There is a lot of action in warehousing-led quick commerce and direct-to-consumer (D2C) home delivery"" Amit admits.

Even in this competitive landscape Amit says ShopX is looking at the opportunity for shops and kirana stores to have a digital storefront on its platform. They posit that India's value-driven consumers will shop from physical stores.

In early 2021 the core team at ShopX reflected if they could digitise the offline transactions and have an offline checkout process that rewards consumers for every purchase they do while providing sales and marketing benefits (from brands) to the small retailers.

So the brands will transfer the cashbacks to retailers through ShopX a percentage of which it keeps. The shop or brand can advertise the cashbacks on the ShopX app to attract customers to the shops and stores in their neighbourhoods.

""The D2C wave in India also has an offline component"" Amit points out. Brands like Bewakoof are already on the ShopX app.

For the customer the engagement on the app involves quizzes to win cashbacks from shops and brands in their vicinity. There is also an optional step to keep track of savings and offers through WhatsApp.

""We run the marketing programmes to onboard consumers who can log into the app discover where value lies in the offline world across categories and redeem that value by transacting using ShopX"" Amit says.

The customer can locate the shop call them or see its microsite on the ShopX app. He visits the shop to buy for the cashback which the retailer makes available.

For brands it is an opportunity to plan their marketing programmes and incentives based on how each of the schemes are faring with end-customers.

""We understand offline retail really well"" Amit says. ""We want to build on our core competence and multi-year experience in the space and carry on the mission of digitising millions of retailers.""

ShopX continues to believe in the millions of shops driving retail in India.",,,

(KKTV) - Police say domestic violence was at the center of a deadly shooting at a Pueblo dollar store late last week.

Renee Francisca Dominguez 38 died at the 4th Street Dollar General Jan. 14 after she was reportedly chased by her partner from the parking lot into the store. The gunman was shooting as he ran after her.

“It was a brutal homicide” said Pueblo Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Frank Ortega adding that it appeared she was caught completely by surprise.

Hours later the shooter took his own life in El Paso County.

Ortega told 11 News reporter Jack Heeke that there was a long history of domestic violence in the relationship.

“There was a lengthy criminal history involving domestic violence restraining orders and incidents of criminal activity involving them yes.”

The tragic events of Jan. 14 are just one example among many such cases in the city Ortega said.

“Unfortunately we handle domestic violence cases too often. It’s too common and it’s a bad situation for the community and the people who are involved in relationships.”

Local non-profit TESSA which offers support for domestic violence survivors says relationship violence ending in death is not a rare outcome. CDC data bears that out; as recently as 2017 homicide was one of the top five causes of death among women 44 and younger.

“Incidents where domestic violence ends in death is obviously the worst-case scenario” said TESSA CEO Anne Markley. “That does happen less frequently but that’s not to say it doesn’t happen. We certainly see levels of violence that escalate very high without ending in death.”

The exact nature of the couple’s relationship is unclear; Ortega would only describe it as “intimate.” He did not believe the pair had any children.

Meanwhile a memorial continues to grow for Dominguez outside the Dollar General.

Ortega says there are many resources for people in abusive relationships.

“One of the first one that comes to mind is ACOVA. That’s a victim rights organization that’s run out of the sheriff’s department. That’s one of the first because they have advocates that can assist victims with appropriate resources. One of the issues with domestic violence is there’s a lot of additional problems besides the domestic violence. ‘Where do I live? What do I eat? Where do I stay?’ Stuff like that. So one of the better resources we have in the community is ACOVA.”

TESSA has a confidential safe line available 24/7: 719-633-3819.

(CNN) — “I am not happy!”

“Does NOT sit right with me.”

“Calamity.”

“Sick to my stomach.”

Dollar Tree’s recent decision to end $1 prices after 35 years and raise most items at stores to $1.25 has elicited an angry response from many loyal customers on Twitter Facebook TikTok and YouTube.

Video bloggers with hundreds of thousands of followers posted videos of their reactions to the price hike — or entering a store for the first time and seeing Dollar Tree’s ubiquitous green and yellow “Everything’s $1” circles replaced with $1.25 signs.

Some shoppers have started derisively calling the chain “$1.25 Tree” and say it should change its name.

The criticism highlights the risks that Dollar Tree — the last of the big dollar store chains to actually sell nearly everything for a dollar — took when it abandoned its $1 brand identity.

“I wish they wouldn’t have done that because most of their shoppers are people who are not getting paid a lot of money” said Leniza Costa a beauty influencer in Pawtucket Rhode Island who is “known for always going” to Dollar Tree.

Costa won’t shop at Dollar Tree as often and instead will look to purchase $1 items at Walmart.

“This is the worst time to increase the price when everything else is so much” she said.

We won’t know for certain whether customers are turning their backs on Dollar Tree’s new prices until it reports its quarterly results in the coming weeks. But there are signs the move may be alienating some shoppers.

A weekly online survey of around 500 consumers by Coresight Research a retail research and advisory firm found a 6.2% drop from December 27 to January 3 in the number of customers who said they had bought non-food items at Dollar Tree compared to the prior two weeks. A steeper decline of 12.2% was recorded among shoppers ages 45 to 60. Other chains including Walmart and Dollar General did not see similar drops in the surveys.

Dollar Tree added the $1.25 prices to more than 2000 stores in December (it has around 8700 US stores) and Coresight said in a report that its “decline in shopper numbers appears to coincide with its price hike.” The firm cautioned against an “overreliance on a single week’s data point” but said the latest figures “may reflect a shopper exodus on the back” of the price change.

“We have had a very positive response from the overwhelming majority of our customers around the $1.25 price point and the extreme value and broader product selection it has enabled especially in these inflationary times” a Dollar Tree spokesperson said in an email. “We look forward to providing more details on this initiative during our next earnings call.”

‘Our niche’

The $1 price was almost sacrosanct to Dollar Tree which sells toys home furnishings kitchenware holiday decorations stationary party supplies arts and crafts books food household essentials and other items.

Macon Brock a Dollar Tree founder said in his 2017 autobiography that “I viewed the dollar-only concept as sacred. It was everything. Without it we’d be just another discount retailer.”

“Ditch the dollar I believed and we’d surrender our niche” he wrote.

As recently as August Dollar Tree chief executive Michael Witynski said the company was committed to $1. “This dollar price point is going to be more important than ever” he said on an analyst call.

Selling everything for $1 was also easy on Dollar Tree store operations. Workers didn’t have to constantly spend time changing price displays in aisles or tags on shelves and it was simple for customers on tight budgets to keep track as they shopped.

Dollar Tree raised prices because its business was pressured by having to keep everything under $1. Labor transportation fuel merchandise and shipping costs have surged squeezing the company’s profits.

Some merchandise also suffered as a result of the $1 strategy. The chain had to discontinue several “customer favorites” the company said in November particularly in packaged and frozen foods. Raising prices will give Dollar Tree flexibility to reintroduce those items expand its selection and bring in new products to draw customers according to the company.

Dollar Tree had started selling items at $1.25 and $1.50 at some stores and said it got positive positive customer feedback on the test leading the company to announce in November that it will move to $1.25 at all of its stores.

On December 12 in response to an activist investor pushing for broader changes at the company including nominating an entirely new board of directors Dollar Tree’s board said the price hike has been successful thus far.

The performance of stores with $1.25 prices “continues to validate our earlier tests and demonstrates the success of the Company’s strategy and execution” the board said in a statement. The board said the move to $1.25 “was not a decision the Company took lightly and required careful planning including to ensure that it continues to provide a meaningful assortment with extreme value” to shoppers.

But some retail analysts have said the decision was rushed jeopardizes the brand’s image and will lead shoppers to turn to competitors such as Dollar General which sells around 20% of its products for $1.

The price change “saddened” the Scent Maven a video blogger who posts about her hauls at Dollar Tree and other stores and will lead her to shop there less often. (She spoke under the condition that her name be withheld from the story to protect her identity.)

“We all in the Dollar Tree community hoped it wouldn’t happen” she said adding that $1 was a price “you could count on.”

“There was no doing math in your head or anything like that” she said. “You know you could go to the Dollar Tree with $10 and walk out with 10 items.”

Although Dollar Tree has put up new signs at stores that say it will offer new items and “more thrills” at $1.25 she has yet to see the change.

The two teens one from Butts County the other from Newton County who had been missing since Christmas Eve have been located the Newton County Sheriff's Office announced Saturday.

Fifteen-year-old Alasia Vaughn and 16-year-old John Sharpe had last been seen on December 24 2021 near a Butts County Dollar General according to Alasia's mother.

The Vaughns are from Covington but Ann says Alasia went to visit her grandmother's house in Butts County just before the holiday.

John also disappeared on Christmas Eve. Alasia's mother Ann Vaughn said she did not believe the disappearance was a case of two teenagers running away together.

""Something doesn't feel right. She would've asked to use a restaurant's phone she would've called me or her sister"" she said after returning home from a search party in Henry County earlier this month.

MISSING TEENS FROM BUTTS NEWTON COUNTIES BELIEVED TO BE TOGETHER

Both Butts and Newton County sheriff's office previously posted about the teen disappearances.

Alasia is described by deputies as being 5-feet-5-inches tall weighing about 190 pounds. She had last seen with her hair in a ponytail wearing a red jacket with a hood.

John is described by investigators as being 5-feet-8-inches tall weighing about 140 pounds. Authorities say it's not clear what he was wearing when he left his home on Green Commons Drive.

Police responded to reports of shots fired around 4 p.m. Saturday at 1319 Military Cutoff Road. When they arrived at the scene officers found the bodies of two adults and one juvenile.

Another person was found alive with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The man is a suspect in the shooting Wilmington Police Chief Donny Williams said in a statement to the media on Saturday. The man was transported to the hospital and is being treated for his injuries.

On Sunday morning Lt. Leslie Irving public information for the police department said the investigation continued through the night and is still ongoing. After being taken into custody the man was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and firing into an occupied vehicle.

There is a family relationship between the suspect and the victims according to Irving which has made notifications for next of kin difficult.

""It is the intention of the Wilmington Police Department to eventually release all family aspects of this homicide"" Irving said.

Irving said the department is asking for patience as they work to contact surviving family members.

""This is a very unfortunate tragic incident and our hearts and thoughts go out to the families that were impacted by this"" Williams said.

Williams said this is an isolated incident and there is no continued threat to the community.

He said the investigation is in its very early stages and law enforcement will release further information as it becomes available. He declined to take questions following his statement to the media on Saturday.

""We know there are a lot of questions about what took place here today and our intentions are to be transparent and release as much information as we can while at the same time being respectful and seeking justice for our victims"" Williams said.

(WRDW/WAGT) - Aiken Electric Cooperative is reporting power outages in Aiken Edgefield and Saluda counties. Over 150 houses are without power.

The outage map shows some have been without power for nearly an hour and half.

South Carolina’s electric cooperatives reported over 40000 outages at this hour across the state mostly in the north of South Carolina. Out-of-state crews are assisting to repair electricity.

For the latest outage map from Aiken Co-op: LATEST OUTAGE MAP

Dominion Energy reports a peak of roughly 17000 outages just before 10 a.m. Sunday. They say most outages occurred in the Midlands with Fairfield and Richland Counties being their hardest hit areas. Dominion reports majority of impacted customers have now had their power restored.

As of 10 a.m. Sunday approximately 61000 customers in Georgia were without power as the weather system continues to move through the state. Thousands of Georgia Power personnel are out in the field responding to impacts from the winter storm. There are a few outages reported in our area.

If you come across any downed power lines always assume the line is turned on and dangerous. Downed lines may be difficult to spot so always be cautious when walking around after a storm.

(WVIR) - Power companies are hoping the winter storm is not as heavy as the last storm.

“One thing that we’re hoping for is that the consistency of the snow this time will be different than last week” said Jonathan Costen with Dominion Energy.

Although there have already been some scattered outages power companies are saying this snow should do less damage.

“Last week I heard a lot of our veteran linemen say hey this snow is really heavy. It’s a wet dense snow and that was taking down a lot of the tree limbs and taking down a lot of the power lines and things like that. This is a dry snow and it’ll blow off easier than it did last week” said Costen.

However the ice and wind could cause outages.

“The part that is different that still has us a little bit worried is how much ice or how much sleet and freezing rain will we get and that could lead to some challenging issues with trees falling or downed power lines” said Casey Hollins with Rappahannock Electric Cooperative.

If the snow does knock some power lines out Dominion Energy says it is ready.

“We have total less than 5000 folks working. 4800 folks work in roughly and that was comparable to last week and we have folks coming in from nine different states and mutual aid 900 different mutual aid crews on standby from nine different states” Costen said. “We are attacking this aggressively.”

REC has crews working in the field as long as conditions are safe.

“If there’s extremely high wind conditions or just really hazardous conditions for crews to be out working in then we wouldn’t send them out but we’re not seeing that at this point” Hollins said. “If we do we would certainly send out notifications to let people know that we have to call our crews.”

(WWBT) - Dominion Energy Rappahannock Electric and Southside Electric (SEC) are making sure they’re prepared for potential outages resulting from Sunday’s winter storm

During the last storm all three companies experience widespread outages totaling hundreds of thousands across the commonwealth.

In the days leading up to the storm all three major power companies have been assembling crucial manpower and supplies ahead of Sunday’s snowstorm.

SEC Community Relations Director Lloyd Lenhart says the power company brought in additional power poles should any poles snap under the weight of snow and ice.

“At this point we’ll prepare for the worst and hope for the best” Lenhart said. “We have restocked four warehouses and supply yards with the materials needed for the upcoming storm.”

Lenhart said in addition to the 100 personnel from its company it also has 300 additional workers coming in from co-ops North of us.

“We’ve got crews as far away as Arkansas Illinois and Maryland” Lenhart said.

REC says it has about 300 personnel and 200 mutual aid workers pre-staged in areas they expect to be the hardest hit from Sunday’s storms

“We do expect the storm to have the hardest impact as we get later into the evening” REC Communication’s Manager Casey Hollins said.

“What we’re prepared to do is if some of the areas where we have crews who don’t get as much impact we’ll be able to move those crews over to the areas that are hit hardest.”

So far Dominion Energy hasn’t seen much impact in the Richmond area and has focused most of its attention on the more rural parts of its service areas.

Like the other two power companies Dominion is encouraging customers to report power outages the moment they happen.

“In about a third of our territory we have something called smart meters which does a better job of telling us when power is out but we’re still largely reliant in most of our territory on reporting” said Dominion spokesperson Craig Howell.

“We have a good idea that your power may be out if several of your neighbors have reported but that’s not always guaranteed so the more you report the better off we’ll be from a data standpoint.”

Accumulating ice can lead to power outages with just a quarter-inch of ice.

across the Lynchburg area and Roanoke but power loss should be scattered and not widespread.



The worst conditions will be across the Carolinas. Thick ice will likely cause widespread electricity losses near Greensboro Charlotte and toward Greenville-Spartanburg. It could be a crippling ice storm for that region.

A reminder that 911 is for emergencies only. Pittsylvania County 911 saw its busiest day ever last February during the ice storm -- but most of the calls were to report power outages.

Domino’s recently announced changes to one of its popular menu options. While the chain is known primarily for pizza it also offers a variety of chicken wing options to its customers.

According to a recent announcement however customers are going to start getting less wings.

At the 2022 ICR Conference Domino’s CEO Ritch Allison explained that several changes will be coming to the Domino’s menu Nation’s Restaurant News reports. He stated that the chain’s $7.99 carryout deal will now only include eight wings.

Allison explained that commodity costs and inflation are responsible for the reduction in wings. The move is reportedly being made in anticipation of increases in both the cost of food and wages.

The $7.99 carryout deal will also become an online-only deal.

Domino’s CEO also discussed how digital sales have shown the company areas where it can grow. According to the report about 50% of Domino’s sales come from digital orders. Of those orders two-thirds are made up of delivery orders.

The rest of the digital sales come from take-out orders.

Part of Domino’s move towards focusing on digital orders was also inspired by streamlining employee responsibilities. With more orders coming from digital sources (websites and apps) that means that fewer employees are needed to answer the phone.

The company also stated that it plans to continue to invest in its supply chain infrastructure in the coming year along with investing in new technologies to drive growth.

Paint color may be the biggest design decision parents-to-be face when decorating a nursery. For decades the debate has been pretty narrow: Do you opt for blue pink or yellow? According to Babysense’s 2022 nursery trends however the top color for the room this year isn’t any of the previously mentioned. Instead nurseries are getting in on the green trend. The color saw a 17 percent increase in searches on Pinterest over the past 12 months. Knocking 2021’s popular white and black off their top spots the nature-inspired hue is still bright yet soothing while also not playing into traditional gender stereotypes—a priority for 2022’s new parents.

However you don’t just have to just cover the walls with a solid swath of paint. Here we highlight three of our favorite unconventional ways to use the shade in kids’ spaces.

Not-So-White Stripes

Alternating wide mint green and pale blue stripes make up a whimsical (and low-lift) backdrop in Kitty Patterson’s nursery for her son. “It’s easier to paint stripes than hang wallpaper and obviously it’s much less of a commitment” she explains. Paired with solid green trim and doors the color is bold and enchanting—Patterson’s precise goal.

These foods can be prepared quickly and also make people feel full for a long time. These dishes on the other hand have no nutritional value but people enjoy consuming them because of their taste. Who doesn’t like Italian pizza? But if bugs are moving around in the pizza would you eat it?

A man from New Zealand has created a social media sensation by posting a picture of a worm coming out of a Domino’s Pizza. The man claims that maggots were moving around in his pizza. Reginald Thalari is the name of the man who has posted a picture of insects moving around in his pizza.

The man brought home a Domino’s pizza and was surprised to see insects moving in it when he opened the box. The man’s claim has also tarnished Domino’s reputation.

Reginald stated that he had ordered four Domino’s pizzas and was eating them with his coworkers. After a few bites he noticed something moving on top of the toppings. Everyone became nauseous when they found that bugs were moving on top of the pizza.

Someone posted a picture of it on the internet. Insects can be seen walking on the ham and pepperoni pizza in the photo. The man claims that he never expected to find insects in his Domino’s Pizza.

Domino’s on the other hand denied this after the photos went viral. According to the company it bakes fresh pizza every day. It is impossible to get the worm inside in such a situation because while baking the worms will perish.

Domino’s however has refunded the man after he filed a complaint.

Domino’s Pizza is a multinational pizza restaurant chain that was founded in 1960.

Forgotten Jack Simpson's Rangers exit could spark the arrival of John Souttar claims pundit Alex Rae.

Souttar has penned a pre-contract agreement to take him to Ibrox in the summer but Hearts remain committed to keeping him at Tynecastle until his deal ends.

But Rangers midfielder Rae reckons there could be some wheeling and dealing done to secure an early departure from the capital starting with Simpson's exit.

Simpson hasn’t featured at all under Gio van Bronckhorst and only got back on the bench for the last three games.

A number of English Championship clubs are circling the 25-year-old as he remains well out of the picture with the Premiership champions.

Rae told Clyde 1 Superscoreboard: ""It really depends on how much they want him (Souttar to Rangers).

""Now you could try and punt the boy Simpson.

""There are links with Middlesborough Queens Park Rangers and Sheffield United as well.

""So there are teams of a decent stature that are looking to bring him in.

""If you could sell him for £500K you could maybe throw a couple of quid on top of that (to offer Hearts).

""You would weaken Hearts but if you get rid of Simpson and bring in Souttar I think Rangers are stronger going into the second part of the season.

""I think the deal has to get done but I think it will drag on to the end of the month.

""I think Hearts will look for top dollar and then it will come to some sort of resolution."""

Tony Dow on a life of art post-""Leave It to Beaver""

Tony Dow on a life of art post-""Leave It to Beaver""

In the studio where he's spent the last 20 years sculpting meditations on our humanity the artist is carving a gnarled piece of burl wood into a dramatic figure that'll then be cast in bronze wrestling some sense of optimism from the struggle life so often presents.

Correspondent Jim Axelrod asked ""This face is in pain? And you're changing it to what?""

""To one of hope"" the artist replied.

As many as 50 hours of work go into a piece before it's ready for his signature: ""T. Dow."" ""Once you start a piece that piece takes control"" he laughed. ""What it does is it tells you what you need to do next.""

Sculptures by the actor and artist Tony Dow. Tony Dow

Finally at the age of 76 the artist Tony Dow is happy to relinquish control of his work. It wasn't always like that: ""From the time I was 11 or 12 I was being told what to do"" he said. ""I was told on the set. I was told at home. I didn't have control of my life.""

""You were literally given your lines?"" asked Axelrod.

""Yeah.""

At the age of 12 Dow began starring as Wally Cleaver on ""Leave It to Beaver"" a TV series depicting a mythical version of mid-century American life – a show so popular it's never left the screen since its debut in 1957.

""The genius of 'Leave It to Beaver' was that the show was written from a child's point of view"" said Dow.

Born in Hollywood Dow was a competitive swimmer as a kid when he tagged along with his coach to an audition. The coach didn't get the part. But as his mother told him at lunch Dow got an offer: ""I took a bite of my hamburger and I took a sip of my malt and I said: 'OK.' And there went my life!"" he laughed.

Beaver (Jerry Mathers): ""What's this Wally?""

Wally (Tony Dow): ""Well that's an official Scout's compass. I don't know exactly how it works but when you start out somewhere it's supposed to tell you which way you're going.""

Overnight Dow's life headed in a direction no compass could help him navigate. A teen heartthrob before he could drive his adolescence unfolded in front of millions as he played the polite trustworthy ""All-American"" big brother.

Axelrod asked ""You didn't think Wally was gonna define you?""

""No I didn't"" Dow replied. ""But it did. And I was gonna have to live with it for the rest of my life. I thought: This isn't fair. You know? I mean I'd like to do some other stuff. I'd like to do some interesting stuff. You know it's sad to be famous at 12 years old or something and then you grow up and become a real person and nothing's happening for you.""

The sadness turned to anger setting Dow up for a struggle that would mark the rest of his life.

""Anger if it's untreated anger turns to depression"" he said. ""But depression isn't something you can say 'Cheer up!' about. You know it's a very powerful thing. And it's had a lot of effect on my life.""

WEB EXTRA: Tony Dow talks about depression:

Axelrod asked Lauren Dow Tony's wife of 41 years ""What's it like to listen to Tony talk about the depression?""

""Well I'm very proud of him for talking about it for dealing with it and for sharing it with others"" she replied.

Lauren helped Tony balance the curse of being linked forever to Wally by helping him see clearly the blessings.

Axelrod asked ""What did you fall in love with?""

""His sweetness softness vulnerability"" she said.

""I hate to do this. It's so trite and clichéd. But … ""

""Spit it out!""

""Sounds like Wally! Is there any Wally in him?""

""I think there's a lot of Tony in the character"" Lauren said. ""They're intertwined. Wally was very much like Tony.""

An artist herself Lauren Dow makes mosaics in her own space in their shared studio.

""I think the art is like the best thing for him"" she said. ""And he's created some very interesting things while depressed.""

Tony too credits his art - combined with medication and therapy - for getting a handle on his depression: ""And I've got it under control pretty much. You know I think people should take the leap of faith that they can feel better.""

Tony Dow at work in his studio. CBS News

He still takes an occasional acting job always aware that ""Wally"" is lurking nearby – but no longer troubled by it.

""I felt that way probably from the time I was 20 maybe until I was 40"" he said. ""And then at 40 I realized how great the show as how appreciative I should be for being in that show.""

Around his home in the hills above Los Angeles are plenty of signs of that appreciation: a pennant from the fictional Mayfield High that Wally attended; a bound collection of ""Leave It to Beaver"" scripts; even a box of cornflakes with Tony and Jerry Mathers who played the Beaver all grown up.

And in his driveway sits a sleek example of the benefits Wally Cleaver still provides Tony Dow: His first car a 1961 Corvair he bought with ""Leave It to Beaver"" money only to sell four years later.

Before the guy who bought it died a few years ago he decided to leave it to Dow returning the car – and with it a reminder that perspective is the foundation of making peace with pain.

Correspondent Jim Axelrod with Tony Dow reunited with his Corvair. CBS News

""You sure this was it?"" Axelrod asked.

""I'm sure. Oh yeah it's got the same license plate. So anyway pretty cool!""

""Yeah I mean it is one of the rewards of being who you are. They knew where to find you!""

""Yeah yeah"" Dow laughed. ""You're giving me all this positive stuff that I should be thinking about instead of all the dumb stuff I think about!""

And – like they seemingly always do at the Tri-Cities Swimming Championship – the Chargers won the day itself.

With yet another stunning display of depth and talent Saturday at SVSU Dow captured the showcase swimming and diving event for the 19th consecutive season. The Chargers tallied 1185 points to outdistance runner-up Saginaw Heritage (809) and the rest of the seven-team field.

Midland (714.5) finished third followed by Bay City Western (591.5) Bay City Central (577) John Glenn (452) and Essexville Garber (432).

Heritage did its best to steal Dow’s thunder claiming first place in seven of the 12 events and landing Swimmer of the Meet honors for Andrew Gladki.

John Glenn’s Jamie Miller dominated diving with an eye-popping score of 454.5 in the only event not won by Dow or Heritage.

Champion Dow saw Thomas Bacigalupo stand atop the podium in the 100 butterfly and Nathan Velez take top honors in the 100 backstroke. The team’s other two wins came in the leadoff relay and the closing relay.

The Chargers touched out Heritage by 16-hundredths of a second in the 200 medley relay to get the meet off to an electric start. They edge Heritage by 3-tenths of a second in the 400 freestyle relay to send fans to the exit with a buzz.

In between Heritage and its celebratory hawk statue were a common site atop the podium. Andrew Gladki won the 200 IM and 100 breaststroke Daniel Gladki claimed the 200 freestyle and 500 freestyle Tyler Hammis was first to the finish in the 50 freestyle and Wilson Borello won the 100 freestyle for the Hawks. Heritage also took the 200 freestyle relay.

Front St. is one of the least environmentally-friendly in the country.

Find Energy an organization that tracks the energy industry recently ranked the Monroe plant on its “100 Dirtiest Power Plants in the United States” list placing the local plant at No. 4.

Using data provided by the Environmental Protection Agency for the year 2020 Find Energy calculated the average rate at which power plants emit carbon dioxide (CO2) per megawatt of energy generated per hour.

The Monroe plant which mostly generates power using coal had a rate of 1008.6kg of CO2 emissions per megawatt generated an hour. In 2020 the plant on average generated about 13.2 million megawatts per hour.

Eric Younan a senior communications strategist at DTE Energy said the issue is more complex than simply looking at CO2 emissions and Find Energy’s list is misleading.

DTE Energy has invested more than $2.3 billion at the Monroe plant to limit emissions he said adding that has helped reduce nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions.

“DTE Energy is committed to protecting the environment while providing reliable affordable and cleaner energy to Michigan residents” Younan said. “This vision is demonstrated at Monroe Power Plant as the plant is one of the most efficient coal-fired power plants in the United States when you consider all emissions.”

According to Find Energy about a quarter of CO2 emissions in the U.S. are created from power generation. The organization specifically highlights that about 43% of that annual metric is fueled by 100 power powers which are mostly coal plants.

“Most of this lack of efficiency is the result of (the plants’) choice of fuel types such as coal and other fossil fuels” the organization wrote in its article. “The advanced age of these plants is another contributing factor as they sometimes don’t take advantage of modern-day energy efficient equipment and methods.”

Find Energy says those plants produce significantly more than their share of CO2 emissions compared to the rest of the country producing only about 20% of the country’s overall power generation.

Find Energy advocates a shift from coal to other energy sources.

“… if we really want to lower CO2 emissions we may be better served by closing and replacing the plants on this list and others like them” Find Energy wrote in its article.

Younan says a shift like that takes time and DTE Energy is in the midst of transforming how it produces energy.

The company has a goal of one day having net zero carbon emissions in its electric and gas utilities Younan said.

“DTE Electric’s net zero goal sets the framework for DTE to go beyond its existing commitments to reduce carbon emissions 50% by 2028 and 80% by 2040 ensuring our medium- and long-term plans align with the scientific consensus around the importance of achieving significant economy-wide emissions reduction by 2050” Younan said. “This vision is well underway.”

The company is investing in cleaner energy such as wind and solar parks and a natural gas plant while also accelerating its coal plant retirements he added.

The River Rouge Power Plant which used coal was retired by the company last year. St. Clair and Trenton Channel coal power plants will be retired later this year. The Belle River Power Plant will cease burning coal by 2028.

The Monroe plant which is currently DTE Energy’s largest generator of power and accounts for about 40% of its electric generation is set to be retired by 2040.

Additionally the Monroe plant has a Wildlife Habitat Council certification and ecological testing of animals and the land surrounding the plant is indicative of a healthy ecosystem Younan said.

Three other Michigan plants were on Find Energy’s list: the J.H. Campbell Power Plant in Ottawa County ranked No. 37; the Belle River Power Plant in St. Clair County ranked No. 74; and Midland Cogeneration Venture in Midland Mich. ranked No. 94.

The old Pine Knob Music Theatre in Clarkson Michigan will once again be known as the Pine Knob Music Theatre.

More than two decades after it changed its name to the ""DTE Energy Music Theatre"" it's going back to its original name.

Many concert-goers continued to use its original name even after the name change in 2001.

It opened in 1972 with a matinee performance by David Cassidy. Over the years it has hosted a long list of music acts including Kid Rock The Barenaked Ladies Aerosmith Iron Maiden Billy Joel and The Eagles.

Fifty years ago it was the largest outdoor music venue in the U.S.

More than 10000 response workers staged and ready to begin power restoration as soon as weather conditions safely permit.

CHARLOTTE N.C. – Duke Energy today said the hazardous wintry precipitation from this weekend’s approaching winter storm could cause an estimated 750000 customers to lose power in North Carolina and South Carolina based on the storm’s current forecasted track and power outages in some of the hardest-hit areas could last several days.

In advance of the storm which could span two days Duke Energy has strategically staged more than 10000 workers – power line technicians damage assessors and vegetation workers – across the Carolinas. About 4100 of those workers are from other companies some based in Texas and Oklahoma.

The more than 10000 total workers also include Duke Energy crews normally based in Florida Indiana Ohio and Kentucky who have traveled to the Carolinas to assist North Carolina- and South Carolina-based Duke Energy workers. All crews are ready to begin power restoration as soon as weather conditions safely allow.

Ice-buildup on trees and branches that causes them to fall on power lines is usually the main culprit behind power outages during a winter storm. Specifically ice buildup of a quarter-inch or more is often the threshold amount that causes trees and branches to topple.

The heavy weight of significant ice buildup directly on power lines themselves can sometimes cause the lines to fall or sag as well. Heavy wet snow of six inches or more also can cause trees and branches to fall on power lines.

Duke Energy meteorologists continue to monitor weather conditions and the company is making plans accordingly. Travel conditions could be hazardous and challenging after the storm passes possibly delaying Duke Energy crews’ ability to access hard-hit areas to assess storm damage and begin power restoration.

Following the storm as conditions permit damage assessment crews will begin assessing extent of damage – which can sometimes take 24 hours or more in major storms with widespread damage and hazardous driving conditions.

Damage assessments determine the types of crews equipment and supplies needed to restore power.

Power restoration crews will begin working immediately after the storm but restoration efficiency improves as damage assessment information is available to ensure the right workers and materials are dispatched to each power outage location.

Duke Energy will provide estimated power restoration times to customers once damage assessments are completed. The company also will provide regular updates to customers and communities through emails text messages outbound phone calls social media and its website which includes power outage maps.

The company is working closely with state officials in both North Carolina and South Carolina to prepare for the storm.

Duke Energy serves 4.3 million customers in the Carolinas – 3.5 million in North Carolina; 800000 in South Carolina.

How customers can prepare

Customers can take steps now to prepare for the storm:

Ensure an adequate supply of flashlights batteries bottled water non-perishable foods medicines etc. as well as the availability of a portable battery-operated radio TV or weather radio.

Customers should make alternate shelter arrangements as needed if you will be significantly impacted by a loss of power – especially families who have special medical needs or elderly members.

If a power line falls across a car that you’re in stay in the car. If you MUST get out of the car due to a fire or other immediate life-threatening situation do your best to jump clear of the car and land on both feet. Be sure that no part of your body is touching the car when your feet touch the ground.

Be aware that snow can cause hazardous driving conditions resulting in traffic accidents and downed power poles resulting in isolated outages. If you are driving and encounter emergency responders or other roadside work crews remember to MOVE OVER.

If you use a generator due to a power outage follow the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure safe and proper operation. Operate your generator outside; never operate it inside a building or garage.

Don’t use grills or other outdoor appliances or equipment indoors for space heating or cooking as these devices may emit carbon monoxide.

Stay away from power lines that have fallen or are sagging. Consider all lines energized as well as trees or limbs in contact with lines. Please report downed power lines to Duke Energy or local emergency services.

Be prepared for an emergency by purchasing an emergency preparedness kit from the Red Cross.

More tips on what to do before during and after a storm can be found at duke-energy.com/safety-and-preparedness/storm-safety. A checklist serves as a helpful guide but it's critical before during and after a storm to follow the instructions and warnings of emergency management officials in your area.

Shelter information

If you lose power and need to relocate to a shelter the Red Cross maintains an update-to-date list of open locations – https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/find-an-open-shelter.html.

Follow CDC recommendations for staying safe and healthy in a public disaster shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic.

How to protect refrigerated food during power outages

For customers who lose power and have full refrigerators and freezers the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends the following:

Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to maintain the cold temperature.

A refrigerator can keep food cold for about four hours if it is unopened. If the power will be out for more than four hours use coolers to keep refrigerated food cold.

A full freezer will keep the temperature for approximately 48 hours (24 hours if it is half full) if the door remains closed.

The FDA offers additional tips for proper food handling and storage before during and after a power outage at www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/food-and-water-safety-during-power-outages-and-floods.

Duke Energy never makes such calls to customers never threatens to cut off customers’ power immediately never seeks immediate payment and never calls customers to request personal information.

“Unfortunately scammers are always looking for a new opportunity including a winter storm to steal customers’ money and information. They prey on customers who might be more vulnerable to such scams during stressful situations like a major storm” said Jason Hollifield Duke Energy Carolinas storm director. “Our goal is to protect our customers from such devious schemes.”

Below are tips for customers to avoid scams:

If it’s a recorded voice often referred to as a “robocall” be extra cautious.

Do not provide any personal information.

Duke Energy’s actual recorded calls to customers are informative only. The company’s calls never threaten to cut off power and never request personal information.

If a caller – recorded or live – specifically asks you to pay using a prepaid debit card that’s a red flag. Prepaid debit cards are like cash and the transactions cannot be reversed.

If the caller pressures you to make an immediate payment of any type – or provide personal information of any kind such as a bank account number or social security number – hang up the phone.

If he’s feeling better about wearing his No. 74 Black-and-Gold sweater or perhaps reconsidering his stance that there are greener left wing pastures on which for him to graze the previously chatty DeBrusk is not making it public.

Now a sizzling hot 8-1-0 in the new year and winners of an NHL-best five straight there appears no urgency for the Bruins to find a new port o’ call for the 25-year-old DeBrusk. He’s DFSB for the time being. Perhaps longer.

Not much is happening with Jake DeBrusk. The disgruntled left winger remains DFSB (Designated For Somewhere Better) now some two months after his deal-me-please request to general manager Don Sweeney was made public back when the Bruins struggled to maintain .500 buoyancy in the East.

“I don’t know if he’s changed his mind” said coach Bruce Cassidy prior to the Bruins trimming the Predators in OT 4-3 Saturday afternoon at the Garden. “That’s a question better served by other people. He hasn’t said that to me at all.”

What does the future hold for Jake DeBrusk? John Tlumacki/Globe Staff

A standing Globe request for DeBrusk to comment made to the club’s media relations staff has remained quieter than his stat line.

Meanwhile the former first-round pick plays on usually at Charlie Coyle’s left side on the No. 3 line. It was No. 2 left winger Taylor Hall who proved the hero on Saturday stuffing home the winner only 1:41 into OT.

Lost in the excitement: DeBrusk was but an inch or two from winning it 15 seconds earlier when he stormed down the middle at 3 on 3 and rang the post with his doorstep attempt on Juuse Saros.

Yep missed it by THAT much. A smidge or two closer to Saros’s blocker and who knows maybe DeBrusk has goal No. 6 of the season he’s flashing that infectious smile talking up a Nor’easter-like storm and racing into Sweeney’s office and screaming “Hell no I won’t go.”

No telling Sweeney’s reaction to such a change of heart. In decades past with Harry Sinden calling the shots on Causeway St. DeBrusk would have been dealt the second “trade” rolled off his tongue and arrived in say Winnipeg or St. Louis two or three nights later. By bus.

The low-simmer Sweeney is not that reactionary. Also in a 32-team NHL he may have 31 potential trade partners but he doesn’t have the scoring depth to allow a quick flip of DeBrusk without bringing back legit offense or boosting the back end’s ability to stop scoring. DeBrusk’s stock has fallen. In the trade game he’s a distressed asset in part by virtue of his ask out and by his continued tepid production (5-5—10 in 30 games).

“He’s had some looks” said Cassidy sounding generally pleased with DeBrusk’s overall game of late. “But you know that is where you have to keep pushing. Because that was Pasta [David Pastrnak] three weeks ago — he had some looks and it wasn’t going in. Look at him now right? So you’ve got to stay with it bear down continue to do the things you need to do and hit the net when you get chances.”

Pastrnak one of the game’s elite marksmen went nine games without a goal last month. Amid the current 8-1-0 run Pasta is back pounding (8-2—10).

DeBrusk lacks nothing in speed or willingness to shoot. He’s proven when engaged he can be a force.

He landed five shots Saturday had another attempt blocked and rang that post in OT. He is ever shot-ready reflected in his career scoring line that has as many goals as assists (72). Other than some of the game’s greatest scorers stat lines typically tip toward the assist side of the ledger.

Where DeBrusk’s game lacks most and therefore he can make his greatest strides is fighting for the puck — be it around the net between the hash marks or along the wall. Telling that he again did not land a hit Saturday amid a game in which the two sides totaled an NHL season-high of 91 hits.

DeBrusk has recorded only 12 hits this season the lowest among Bruins forwards and only defenseman Matt Grzelcyk has a lower hit-per-60-minute average (1.72 vs. 1.41) Smack dog Anton Blidh tops that chart with 14.19 hits per 60. It may surprise everyone this side of Helsinki that no Bruin this season has registered more hits than No. 2 pivot Erik “The Hidden Hurt” Haula (70).

DeBrusk doesn’t have to transform himself into a bruiser. He does not have that frame. (6 feet 195 pounds). But the best trade available resides within himself a willingness to use his speed and reasonable size to get after pucks along boards in the corners and contest more in high-danger areas. He is built to fly and produce off the rush and he delivers best when using his jets to burn by checking wingers or defensemen. It’s the heavy mucking grinding blade-to-the-ice workhorse game where he comes up far too light sells himself way too short and too often renders his line a nonfactor on the scoresheet.

Four–plus years into his NHL tour the only one holding back Jake DeBrusk is the one who for the moment wears that No. 74 Black and Gold sweater. His fight is not with the coach the coaching staff the media his placement in the lineup or the placement service in the front office that has yet to find him a new team.

DeBrusk’s greatest fight remains his failure thus far to add to his toolbox with the wrench and pain necessary for him to become a productive consistent top-six NHL winger.

That work or lack of it is all on Jake. He has the goods. He’ll have another chance Tuesday night with the Hurricanes in town to deliver on the promise he once showed. What a platform. What a pity if he doesn’t take advantage of it doesn’t realize that Somewhere Better happens to be right where he is standing.

But one of the hardest-hit communities in North Iowa was Rudd in Floyd County.

About 15 miles east of Mason City Rudd was brutalized by the derecho with houses torn apart and the local library and historical museum left nearly unrecognizable.

Tanks Bar and Grill a popular restaurant in Rudd received its fair share of damage too.

""We lost a quarter of our roof which led to water damage inside"" Tanks Bar and Grill manager Morgan Larson said. ""We had to replace ceiling tiles insulation and part of a wall.""

The damage led to Tanks Bar and Grill being closed for nearly an entire month and it may have been longer if community members didn't step up to help fix the damage.

Rick Jensen of Jensen's New and Old Construction volunteered to fix the damaged part of the roof and Codey Fox the owner of Fox Construction repaired all the damage sustained inside the restaurant for Larson and Tanks Bar and Grill owner Susan Flores.

""Both of them dropped everything for us to come help so we could reopen as soon as possible"" Larson said.

It wasn't just Tanks that North Iowa residents rallied behind. Community members sprung into action to assist the entire town.

The day following the derecho hundreds of people could be seen in the streets of Rudd cleaning up debris and handing out water and food to those impacted by the storm.

Local storms heavy wind shake North Iowa After a night of extreme weather North Iowans are coming together to lend a hand.

The Rudd Public Library which was partially collapsed has received over $11000 in donations from over 123 people in an effort to reconstruct the building.

""It was really amazing to see not only our community but so many surrounding towns come together for us too"" Larson said. ""I personally live in Rudd as well and walking around cleaning up seeing just how many people came into town to help clean up everything in about day and a half was amazing.""

After 22 days Tanks Bar and Grill opened once again and Larson said that the community support they've received since has been a bit staggering.

""It’s been awesome to be back up and running seeing all the customers again"" Larson said. ""Our first weekend open was really busy. We’re so thankful for everyone that’s came in since we reopened.""

On opening day the line to grab one at the 2022 EPCOT Festival of the Arts was reportedly seven hours long at one point.

As the craze continues one Disney fan decided to have a bit of fun and sketch the Figment popcorn bucket and list it on eBay — with the money going towards charity!

Julia a freelance writer and editor from Florida is a huge Disney fan. When she noticed the craze for the Figment popcorn bucket she decided to have a little fun with it. She decided to sketch the Figment popcorn bucket and list it on eBay. As her Twitter bio states she is “most well known for sketching Figment…badly.”

The sketch (which you can see in a screenshot below) ended up going viral and bids came in by the second. In fact the listing went from $600 to $10000 in a matter of seconds which is when Julia decided to end the listing.

She took to Twitter to share in a thread of Tweets:

When I put up the auction for the Figment sketch I had two goals: 1. Give people some joy about a very silly situation involving popcorn buckets. 2. Get a bit of money going to charity. From all the emails and messages I’ve received Goal 1 has been accomplished and I’m so happy that this silly thing brought joy to so many people around the world! So that leaves Goal 2. Last night a series of unusual bids came in that pushed the price from $600 to $10000 in a matter of minutes. It didn’t feel right so I ended the auction and sent an invoice to the winner. The winner messaged me to let me know that the bid was placed accidentally by someone else and that they needed to cancel their bid which they are allowed to do according to ebay rules.

Julia explained that she canceled the bid which means she can list the item again; however she does not feel confident in doing so as she is “worried that listing it again in this format will yield the same result.” With this being said she wants to make sure Habitat for Humanity still gets a good donation and after being reminded by a good friend of a news story about an Andy Warhol sale Julia had an idea.

If you aren’t familiar with the Andy Warhol sale someone bought an Andy Warhol sketch and made multiple really good copies of it. They then sold them for a fraction of the price of the real Andy Warhol art so the purchaser wouldn’t know if they got the real one or a fake copy.

Julia continued to explain in her thread of Tweets:

I’m not quite that creative – and so what I’m going to do is take the original artwork make 100 photocopies and number them from 1 (the original) and 2-101 (the copies). I’ll be keeping 101 because going 101 feels like an accurate description of this. The other 100 items will be placed individually in mailing envelopes and sealed. They’ll be shuffled up so I won’t know which one has the real print and which ones have copies. On Tuesday January 18 2022 at 12 PM ET I’ll be listing an item on ebay of the bad Figment sketch artwork with a buy-it-now price of $10. Like the original listing 90% will go to Habitat for Humanity.

If all 100 copies are sold that means Julia would have raised $900 to Habitat for Humanity!

We love seeing how this small act turned into something much bigger. We hope to see Julia raise the money for Habitat for Humanity and want to thank her for spreading kindness and magic.

Posted:

Some guests who spent most of yesterday at EPCOT in line to buy a $25 Figment popcorn bucket appear to be earning significant sums in the eBay resale market.

We saw numerous Figment Popcorn buckets sell for around $300 yesterday and as the third part supply begins to dry up we are now seeing bids passing $1000.

This auction (below) which still has 4 hour remaining at the time of writing currently has 10 bids with the current bid price of $1025 and 123 users registered to watch the auction.

The release of the Figment Popcorn bucket yesterday created one of the longest lines we have seen at EPCOT with the 5 to 8-hour wait extending throughout the park.

Managers that we spoke to in the park expected they will have a supply for several more days.

When artist Agi Raw moved back to Berlin in 2011 she never saw herself living there for very long let alone in the roughly 580-square-foot apartment she found more than a decade ago in the eastern part of the city (now a hipster haven then a neighborhood full of grandmas or should we say omas). Although she grew up in Germany moving from Poland when she was 5 Raw always thought she’d settle in France where she had worked in the fashion industry and studied art. So for the first few months she turned a blind eye to all the rental’s blights (namely a carpet in the kitchen but also ladybug and butterfly stickers pasted all over the walls).

It took a while for Raw to even upgrade from a mattress on the floor to a bed frame—one she scored from her neighbor for just 60 euros. “I didn’t move with many things back to Germany” recalls Raw. “I was just happy to have my own place.”

But suddenly five years had passed and she still hadn’t changed the place much. She met her then boyfriend Chris who moved in shortly after. “I thought we’re not going to stay here long now. Then we decided to get married” says Raw with a laugh. “Again I said okay now we’ll move—that was two years ago.”

The next thing the couple knew they were returning from their honeymoon and the country was closing down due to the pandemic. This time Raw realized that they weren’t going anywhere anytime soon. At that point they had finally replaced the carpet with a classic black-and-white checkerboard vinyl; painted the walls in neutral shades; and furnished the place in similar swaths of cream white and gray. It wasn’t until she sent Chris out to pick up a new sofa slipcover that the apartment transformed from “50 shades of beige” into a colorful passion project. “I originally wanted the white one but they were sold out” shares Raw. The only options left? Green and orange. They went with the latter (it was the cheapest).

At first Raw was less than enamored with the hue. “I assumed it would take a few days to adjust to the extreme color—it was like an orange stain on white paper” she notes. “I needed to balance it out.” Her method was more color added in without rhyme or reason. There was no plan she stresses. “If I like it I get it” Raw says with a shrug. “It’s not like you’re ripping out a wall. If it really looks that bad just paint over it or sell it.”

No really—when it comes to decor Raw mostly only does one-for-one swaps. Before buying say a new lamp she’ll sell one she’s not in love with anymore. Living in a small space without a whole lot of closets requires being strategic. Nearly every piece of furniture doubles as storage: The blue bench by the window? It houses all the clothes she’s selling online. Friends and family often remark that it’s like living in a museum exhibition. “Chris will sometimes ask where something went and I’ll tell him I sold it weeks ago!” says Raw.

But scouring the local marketplace on eBay for new pieces (it’s even where she scored the large R) isn’t the only way Raw brings vibrancy into their space. As an artist she couldn’t resist a few hands-on projects: creating foam picture frames tiling a nightstand adding a slab of stone to fancify an IKEA Besta unit (it’s now extra seating storage and a media console all in one). Her ideas are often as simple as adding black electric tape to a medicine cabinet to mimic the grout lines in her bathroom but sometimes they’re as troublesome as adhering removable wallpaper to the ceiling an addition that took place only a few months ago.

Raw contemplated using paint but found a statement-making pattern at Berlate Studio that mimics the curvy mirrors hung in the hallway connecting the apartment together. It was love at first sight. “Everything about it was perfect for our living room—airy enough for the low ceilings bold but not too extreme” she shares. “After we added the wallpaper I told Chris we’re staying here for at least two more years.”

Someday though Raw insists the two will relocate—somewhere bigger perhaps as big as a castle in England where her husband is from. Having a myriad of rooms to continue decorating and experimenting with is the dream. Raw has seen her apartment project list grow smaller and smaller and her artwork is more or less staying put. But she does admit to recently replacing a former gallery wall with floating shelves to house all her trinkets. “Chris is always asking ‘When will you be finished?’” says Raw. Her response? “Never.”

On view November 18 2021 – January 15 2022

In art school the terms Positive Space and Negative Space are interchangeable for Figure and Ground implicating that one aspect of the composition has more importance. Lessons in introductory studio classes challenge the student’s assumption or preconceived notion that the figure or object out-weighs the rest of the image and to acknowledge that although our preconceptions and biases urge us to search for the recognizable information the entirety of the composition holds the real meaning. The spaces between and behind are meaningful. Perhaps the positive and negative are interchangeable. Perception is learned and can be shifted.

How does this age-old lesson from Color and Composition relate to contemporary life?

The host of the show is the ESP32 module which generates audio frequency square waves which are fed into a MCP4251 digital potentiometer. From there it is fed into a AS3320 Voltage controlled filter (VCF) from Latvia-based ALFA (which is new to us despite them being manufacturing electronics for sixty years!) This is an interesting device that has a four independently configurable filter elements with voltage controlled inputs for frequency control and resonance. The output from the VCF is then fed into a 6n2p (Soviet equivalent to the 12ax7) twin-triode vacuum tube which is specifically aimed at audio applications.

The suitably distorted filtered square waves then pass into a Princeton Tech Corp PT2399 echo processor chip which being digitally constructed uses the expected ADC/RAM/DAC signal chain to implement an audio echo effect. As with the VCF the echo depth can be modulated via the digipot under the ESP32’s command. For a bit of added bling the vacuum tube output feeds back into the ESP32 to be consumed by the internal ADC and turned into a light show via some PWM controlled LEDs. Lovely.

The final audio output from the echo chip is then fed into a speaker via a pair of LM380 amplifiers giving a power of about 5 W. It sounds pretty good if you ask us and software configurable via Wi-Fi giving this sculpture plenty of tweakabilty.

Of course circuit sculpture come in all shapes and sizes and it wouldn’t do to not mention at least one sculpture clock project and while we’re on it here’s last year’s Remoticon circuit sculpture workshop.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydWVhY2hpZXZlbWVudHMuY29tL240ODM2Ni9maWZhLTIyLWZ1dC11bHRpbWF0ZS10ZWFtLWluZm9ybXMtc2JjLW9iamVjdGl2ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA 22 Locker Room: What's new in Ultimate Team this week? (January 15th),"Our Pick: Theo Hernández (AC Milan — LB — 87)

This is the 17th TOTW for FIFA 22's Ultimate Team but these cards are not out of ideas yet. Headlining the list is Marquinios the PSG centre-back from Brazil with an 89-rated card. Obviously this card has all the defensive numbers to make you swoon but I would also point you towards the fact he has great passing and ball control (for a defender). There are plenty of 87-rated cards to pick from this week but Lazio's centre-mid Milinković-Savić has to be one. His total in-game stats are the third highest in Serie A for players between 20k and 50k. That makes him a bargain at his current 30k price point just make sure you slap a Bandit chemistry style on him. For our final pick of the bunch let's go with Oyarzabal. Obviously the Real Sociedad left-winger doesn't have the pace of some of his La Liga rivals out on this wing like Vinicius Jr or Dembele. Instead Oyarzabal offers technical ability out in left-midfield or as a left-forward. High shooting and passing numbers alongside some straight-up good dribbling will help you clean the board with a few right backs using crosses and hard passes. The featured player with the star above his name and the double upgrade is fan-favourite Cengiz Ünder the Marseille right-winger with twinkle toes.It was always Theo Hernández for us even if Bellingham caught our eye for a split second. This guy is just an outrageous card. He does cost around 250k at the moment but I mean... look at those numbers. 96 pace 80 passing 84 dribbling and great defensive numbers. He is a joke. This card like his last inform will keep you in good stead until the end of the year so the investment is worth it if you have the coin. If you want a laugh this week take a look a Raum and Bellerin's stats for cards in the same position with the same rating.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vc2Fib3RldXItcGFuZGVtaWMtc3R1ZGlvcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Saboteur Was Star Wars Battlefront Dev Pandemic Studio's Best Game,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vc2Fib3RldXItcGFuZGVtaWMtc3R1ZGlvcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2Rob3VzZWtlZXBpbmcuY29tL2xpZmUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9nMzA5MTA4NjIvYmVzdC12aWRlby1nYW1lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 21 Most Popular Video Games of 2024 - Best Video Games to Play Now,"If you’re connected at all to the gaming world — either through your kids or as a gaming fan yourself — you probably already know about some of the most popular trends in video games right now.

Brent Stirton/Getty Images

Top US companies and trade groups have donated more than $8.1 million to Republican lawmakers who voted against Joe Biden's certification as president according to a report by watchdog Accountable.US.

After a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol on January 6 2021 many companies scrambled to cut ties with the 147 GOP lawmakers who voted against certifying the 2020 election result.

Dozens of companies including Walmart Amazon Morgan Stanley and AT&T said they would stop donating to these 147 Republican lawmakers – a group dubbed the Sedition Caucus by political opponents. Others including Microsoft Deloitte and Goldman Sachs said they would pause all political donations.

But Accountable.US says donations to the GOP election objectors soon recovered.

""What makes no sense is why major corporations chose to reward the politicians that weaponized Donald Trump's Big Lie with millions of dollars in campaign cash"" Kyle Herrig president of Accountable.US told Insider.

In the aftermath of the Capitol siege ""many big-name companies assured their customers and employees how much they value our democracy but it's obvious they value something more – holding political influence over as many lawmakers as possible even if those lawmakers voted to subvert our government"" Herrig said.

Here are some of the top donors to the GOP election objectors per Accountable.US's corporate donations tracker which is based on Federal Election Commission (FEC) data on direct donations from Fortune 500 companies and 700 trade associations. The latest data reflects donations through November 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvbWV4aWNvLWFwcHJvdmVzLWVtZXJnZW5jeS11c2Utb2YtcGZpemVycy1jb3ZpZC0xOS1waWxscy9hcnRpY2xlMzgyNzI0NDguZWNl0gF8aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9tZXhpY28tYXBwcm92ZXMtZW1lcmdlbmN5LXVzZS1vZi1wZml6ZXJzLWNvdmlkLTE5LXBpbGxzL2FydGljbGUzODI3MjQ0OC5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mexico approves emergency use of Pfizer's COVID-19 pills,"January 15 2022 03:33 am | Updated 04:50 am IST - MEXICO CITY

Entergy Arkansas Winter Storm Update – 1/15/22 5 p.m.

01/15/2022

Snow is making travel very difficult such as this stretch of Highway 65 in Marshall.

Heavy wet snow is bringing trees down onto power lines and additional snowfall and icy conditions are making travel treacherous through the northern parts of Arkansas.

About 6100 customers are without power with most of the affected customers in the Harrison and Flippin areas. Crews are working to restore power where possible. Additional crews are making their way to the areas to assist but the conditions this evening and overnight will slow progress.

Additional snow and high winds are expected throughout the evening and overnight hours across the northern half of the state.

Estimated restoration times will be made available as soon as possible for these affected areas once we obtain accurate damage assessments from our scout teams who will begin inspections as road conditions allow. Our team will practice social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and this may also slow restoration work. We recommend customers prepare as well. For tips and storm updates visit entergy.com/winterweather.

If you use a generator please ensure you operate it properly by following these safety tips: https://www.entergynewsroom.com/storm-center/generators/

STORM RESTORATION PROCESS

As scouts assess damage in all affected areas the results of what they find help us determine estimated restoration times. We will communicate these estimates with you updating as new information becomes available. Our crews will simultaneously be restoring service where it is safe to do so. We ask for your patience and please know restoring your power safely and quickly is our top priority.

Please be aware the restoration process can be hampered by the surge of instantaneous electrical demand from appliances (heating units water heaters etc.) when service is restored to your location potentially overloading protective devices on Entergy’s electrical system. To help mitigate this problem Entergy encourages you to turn off any electrical heaters or electrical appliances that can easily be turned off until power is restored.

As with any weather event please be mindful of the following safety tips:

Live wires can be deadly. Stay away from downed power lines. Call 1-800-9OUTAGE or 1-800-968-8243 to report downed or dangling power lines poles or other damaged equipment.

Do not trim trees or remove debris on or near downed power lines. Only power company crews or their contractors should remove trees or limbs touching power lines.

Keep away from the immediate areas where crews are working. There is always the danger of moving equipment and the possibility of construction materials or limbs or overhead wires falling to the ground.

If you plan on using a generator for temporary power get a licensed electrician and disconnect from the utility electric system before hooking up to your main electric panel.

Do not run a generator in a confined space without adequate ventilation.

Turn off any electrical appliances that can easily be turned to the off position until power is restored.

Check on seniors who can be particularly susceptible to extreme temperatures.

Try to stay off the roads in affected areas. Restoration crews can work safer and faster if they don’t have to work around traffic.

We want to keep you informed and in control. The best way to get information about outages is via Entergy’s View Outage page on our website. Additional resources for your convenience:

All but two counties in the state were under winter storm warnings or winter weather advisories Saturday evening as some areas saw more snowfall than forecast but Arkansas roads remained largely clear as night fell and temperatures dropped.

Arkansans in the Ozark Mountains saw the most snow during the day with 6-8 inches falling near Harrison and Marshall and more expected overnight said Joe Goudsward senior forecaster at the National Weather Service in North Little Rock.

In Little Rock flurries came down slightly earlier than forecast as cold air rolled in more quickly than expected said Dave Parker Arkansas Department of Transportation public information officer shortly before 6 p.m. Saturday.

""Big fat flakes"" were falling in the metropolitan area by nightfall Goudsward said.

The system of winter weather was expected to work its way east overnight Goudsward said with the snowfall likely petering out by 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. today. Still he expected snow to keep coming in bands over certain areas of the state during the night.

""We could see another 5-6 inches in the Ozark Mountains"" Goudsward said and a couple of inches in the Little Rock area.

At 6 p.m. the National Weather Service reported that it was still above freezing in Little Rock at 35 degrees but North Little Rock was already at 32 degrees with both sides of the river seeing light snow and fog. It was 32 degrees in Harrison at that time with snow still coming down.

Workers were still able to plow the snow off the roads as of 6 p.m. Parker said and there had been no major traffic issues in the state at that point. Although traffic had slowed in the northern counties where snow was heavier traffic elsewhere in the state was not terribly backed up he said.

""[The] snow amounts aren't anything we can't handle"" Parker said.

But the darkness and continued snowfall would make things a little trickier he said. Even an accident involving one vehicle could delay traffic and make it harder for the plows and road crews to get to trouble areas.

""It's still coming down pretty good up there [near Harrison and Marshall]"" Parker said.

If the snow picks up and plows are not able to keep the roads clear workers will start laying down another layer of salt brine he said.

In the Little Rock area the department reacted to the earlier snowfall by deploying crews shortly after 2 p.m. instead of the planned 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. Parker said.

""We just had to adjust had to get our guys in quicker"" Parker said.

The department's work was made easier by the fact that they prepared as early as Thursday to tackle the winter weather with equipment loaded and ready he said.

A second wave of road crews was scheduled to come in around 7 p.m. and work overnight Parker said.

Black ice on roads will almost certainly be a problem through the night and into the morning he said.

""It only takes one little patch of ice to cause a big problem"" Parker said.

About 6:30 p.m. the Entergy Arkansas power outage map online showed sporadic outages totaling fewer than 1000 customers from Harrison to Mountain Home.

Bridge the Gap College Prep a comprehensive after school college prep and summer program centered in Golden Gate Village has served the Marin City community for over 26 years. Many of our students and families live in public and low-income housing in Marin City.

In the 1940s after Bechtel Corp. was awarded a contract to build World War II warships Marin City was born. African Americans from southern states came to Marin City. They were an integral part of the war effort. Marinship built nearly 100 Liberty ships during World War II.

However after the war segregation and redlining encapsulated African Americans to this small area north of Sausalito and denied them the opportunities to build generational wealth through homeownership in the same way that their White counterparts had.

On Feb. 16 1944 these residents formed the Marin City Council Inc. to provide basic services to the community. Their goal was to be self-sufficient. In a county unwelcoming to African Americans the foremothers and forefathers of today’s residents planted roots.

After 10 years of deferred maintenance Marin City’s Marinship buildings deteriorated. In the late 1950s Marin County persuaded the Marin Housing Authority to demolish them and fund a new development on the site. Designed in 1958 and built between 1959 and 1962 the homes were one- and two-story townhouses on mostly level sections and five-story highrises on upslope portions of the site. These building groups currently comprise Golden Gate Village the historic core of the community now known as Marin City.

Over the past decade maintenance and repairs have not kept pace with what is required to address chronic issues of mold electrical and plumbing standards that contribute to unhealthy living conditions in many of the units. The Marin Housing Authority has been working on a long term plan for redevelopment and revitalization most recently with a private developer.

The Golden Gate Village Resident Council has been working diligently on a plan that proposes a “green” revitalization of the property as well as a rehabilitation (not replacement) of the existing units. The 174-page draft report proposes specific solutions to the issues that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development raised including overhousing senior citizen needs community space and a path to homeownership through a community land trust. The council maintains their plan is also the most economical quickest to implement and requires no new buildings.

Bridge the Gap College Prep as advocates for the students and their families that we are honored to continue serving for a quarter century urges the Housing Authority to give the council’s proposal a full and fair review. Bridge the Gap also entreats the Housing Authority to provide transparency throughout the process and work in good faith to collaborate and problem solve with the council.

The last two years of racial unrest pandemic and economic strife have begun to highlight for all residents of Marin County that the educational inequities residential segregation and wealth gap between Black and White residents of Marin County are interrelated.

Bridge the Gap’s focus on academic inequities and intervention is directly connected to issues of our students’ and their family’s housing quality and security. This is an opportunity to not only honor the rich history of the Marinship pioneer families but also continue to address decades of discrimination. Let’s make sure all the children and families of Golden Gate Village have access to healthy safe affordable housing in their historical community.

There's a reason dogs are known as man's best friend - they're loving great companions and very cute.

But sometimes we need to be dogs' best friend.

The Dogs Trust takes in dogs who are no longer able to stay in their home may have been mistreated in the past and are often traumatised by their experiences.

Read more: What's on across Essex

But while this can make many of the dogs at the Dogs Trust shy and perhaps a little less friendly at first these dogs still have so much love to give.

From the majestic King Kazan a siberian husky to inseparable pair Foxy and Kim the short-haired chihuahuas there's a dog at the Dog's Trust that is looking for its forever home with you.

The Dog's Trust isn't like other dog adoption though as there's a thorough vetting process to make sure you and your canine companion will be a good long-term fit for each other.

But all of the dogs here have plenty of character and with a bit of love and care they could become your best friend too.

Here are the 27 dogs looking for their best friends here in Essex.

Ace - American Bulldog





(Image: DogsTrust)

Ace is a seven-year-old American Bulldog currently up for adoption.

Dogs Trust recommends that Ace is only around children aged 14 or over but he still has plenty of love to give.

Dogs Trust says: ""Seven-year-old Ace is a brilliant and beautiful boy ready to find his forever family.

""Don't be fooled by his age he is an active boy who loves to get out for walks!

""He adores spending time with people and will thrive in a multi-person household so that someone is always home.

""To become the best lad he will need owners with previous bull breed experience please tell us about your experience on your application.""

Arnie - Staffordshire Cross (SBT)

Arnie is an older dog looking for a nice and quiet retirement home.

He needs lots of company and often gets distressed when left alone so he'll need someone to be around at all times.

EL,Estée Lauder Companies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9vd25lcnNoaXAtc3RydWN0dXJlLWVzdC1lLWxhdWRlci0xMjQ0MDYyMTMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is The Ownership Structure Like For The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)?,"Every investor in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.

Estée Lauder Companies is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of US$116b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. In the chart below we can see that institutions own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about Estée Lauder Companies.

View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Estée Lauder Companies?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

Estée Lauder Companies already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Estée Lauder Companies (below). Of course keep in mind that there are other factors to consider too.

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Estée Lauder Companies. The company's largest shareholder is Lal Family Partners LP with ownership of 22%. Meanwhile the second and third largest shareholders hold 5.0% and 4.2% of the shares outstanding respectively.

Looking at the shareholder registry we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Estée Lauder Companies

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Story continues

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.. It is a very large company and board members collectively own US$9.5b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership while considerable may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Private Company Ownership

Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 22% of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. For instance we've identified 1 warning sign for Estée Lauder Companies that you should be aware of.

However Schitt’s Creek definitely makes that coveted list. Dan Levy’s award-winning debut series about the riches to rags story of the Rose family is packed with golden gems of comedy and has spurred a number of catchphrases that fans have latched onto. While it’s certainly a good sign when a show is quotable Levy apparently isn’t a huge fan of the series’ most popular catchphrase and he’s revealed the exact reason why that’s the case.

The final season of Schitt’s Creek dropped over a year ago but fans are still reveling in the glory that is the duo of Dan Levy’s David and sister Alexis. Fan-made products with Levy’s face followed by one of his many memorable quotes are all over Amazon and Etsy  but it’s one line in particular that might just “haunt him for the rest of his life” – “Ew David” which was uttered throughout the series by Annie Murphy’s Alexis Rose.

During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!  Dan Levy explained why he isn’t too thrilled about fans quoting the “Ew David” line so frequently. And his reason is definitely understandable. This is what the Happiest Season star says exactly:

It's resulted in a sort of tagline that I think will haunt me for the rest of my life. 'Ew' is not necessarily something you want screamed at you in your most vulnerable time.

What makes this particularly funny is that neither Dan Levy nor David Rose do anything that should really warrant an “Ew.” Alexis is honestly just a little (okay very) dramatic. She says the word to basically anything that costs less than a Prada bag and uses it when acknowledging something that she can’t do in heels; it’s pretty much the opposite of Paris Hilton’s “That’s hot.” Actually Alexis Rose would probably have fit in pretty well with Paris and her posse if she had been around in 2005 and well actually existed.

In addition to her many “Ews” she uses David’s name practically whenever she can. There are plenty of compilations of scenes in which she refers to her brother unnecessarily and it’s amazing that something that simple can be so funny. It’s no wonder the combination of the two exclamations have become the best known catchphrase from the series.

But what really makes the usage of the phrase is David’s reaction to them. Dan Levy is super talented in a number of things and his ability to create humorous facial expressions is certainly a beloved asset. In a way it’s pretty fitting that the actor like his character doesn’t appear to love having “Ew David” thrown his way.

Fans mourned when the series ended after six seasons  at least I know that I did and it’s largely due to the many lovable characters and their interactions with one another. Not all is lost though as Dan Levy is just getting the ball rolling on his career and we can expect plenty more from him in the future maybe even another visit to Schitt’s Creek via a movie .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzE2L3N0dWRlbnRzLXN0dW5uaW5nLXBhaW50aW5ncy1vbi1ib29rLWVkZ2VzLWdvLXZpcmFsLW9uLXRpa3Rvay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Student's stunning paintings on book edges go viral on TikTok,"An art history student has gone viral on TikTok for her incredible artwork: beautiful paintings on the edges of book pages.

Maisie Jackson 22 from England has posted numerous videos on her TikTok account @maisie_matilda showing her intricate work – called fore-edge painting – on copies of literary classics such as the “Harry Potter” series “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy and the “Dune” trilogy.

Many of Jackson’s videos have reached millions including a video showing Jackson painting a picture of Hogwarts on the edges of all seven “Harry Potter” books authored by J. K. Rowling. That footage was viewed more than 8.1 million times.

One video of Jackson painting a scene of Aragorn and Arwen in Rivendell on the edges of a copy of “The Lord of the Rings” was viewed more than 7.4 million times.

Jackson told Fox News via email that she started doing fore-edge painting last summer though she has been a painter for many years.

Her first attempt at fore-edge painting was on a copy of J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Hobbit” on which she painted the famous image of a hobbit hole.

Jackson said she posted the video on TikTok “just for a bit of fun” and thought nothing of it until the next day after her morning shift at work when she saw the clip already had 100000 views. As of Friday it has been viewed more than 411200 times.

Jackson is also finishing her final year of college studying art history which means she only has limited time to do fore-edge paintings she said. However she said she hopes to continue her artwork full time – and sell the creations on Etsy – once she graduates.

“My main aim is to bring fore-edge painting back into popular visual culture” she said. “It is currently deemed ‘critically endangered’ by the Heritage Craft Association UK.”

Jackson said that as she’s been doing fore-edge painting and posting the videos on TikTok she’s seen her confidence and her ability grow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml3bWJ1enouY29tL2dhbWluZy90by1hbGwtdGhlLWNhbmR5LWNydXNoLWZhbnMtb3V0LXRoZXJlLWhlcmUtYXJlLXNvbWUtZmFjdHMteW91LWRpZG50LWtub3cvMjAyMi8wMS8xNtIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml3bWJ1enouY29tL2dhbWluZy90by1hbGwtdGhlLWNhbmR5LWNydXNoLWZhbnMtb3V0LXRoZXJlLWhlcmUtYXJlLXNvbWUtZmFjdHMteW91LWRpZG50LWtub3cvMjAyMi8wMS8xNi9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,To all the candy crush fans out there here are some facts you didn’t know,"To all the candy crush fans out there here are some facts you didn’t know

Maura Casey a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Gray Maine said lower snow accumulations could be seen inland around the local area with higher totals to the north.

""The biggest impact to the southern New Hampshire seacoast will be wind possibly gale force"" Casey said. ""Everyone will start out as snow Sunday night but by about 5-7 a.m. the coast will be mostly rain. It will be warm around 40 degrees so you will see a windy rainy heatwave of sorts.""

Across Rockingham County the snow totals should be in 1-3 inch range she said.

""It will be a quick-hit storm"" Casey said. ""By mid-afternoon it will likely be all wrapped up. But the temperatures by Monday night will return to the 20s so a freeze of wet or ponded surfaces is possible.""

Casey said there is possibility of gale or storm force winds so people should watch updates Monday for potential flooding.

Utilities prepare for potential outages

New Hampshire and Maine power companies are monitoring the storm.

Eversource announced it is preparing for potential power outages late Sunday night and Monday. The company is positioning line and tree crews across the state as well as bringing in additional out-of-state crews to respond to any damage or outages caused by the weather.

“We’ve been carefully monitoring this weather system for the last few days and we’ll have workers and materials in position across the state ready to respond and will adjust our plans if the forecast changes” said Eversource President of New Hampshire Operations Doug Foley. “With wet snow in some parts of the state and wind gusts up to 45 or 50 miles per hour possible there is the potential for trees and tree limbs to come down onto power lines and electric equipment. We’re fully stocked with extra utility poles wire transformers and other equipment and ready to repair any damage this storm may cause.”

Eversource reminds customers to always stay clear of downed wires and to report them immediately to 9-1-1.

Central Maine Power the largest provider in York County is preparing too. CMP has prepositioned crews throughout the service area to respond to potential outages and announced it has secured added resources.

“This is a tough time of year when it comes to the weather in Maine” said Adam Desrosiers CMP vice president of electric operations. “Heavy wet snow like what is forecasted on Monday also causes trees and limbs to break and fall onto power lines ultimately resulting in outages. Regardless we are prepared with internal crews and additional resources ready to respond should outages occur.”

Storm causes closed roads power outages

An overnight storm on Sunday brought heavy wind and rain to the region resulting in flooding downed power lines that closed roads and left many Eversource customers without power Monday morning — including more than 1000 people in Ledyard.

More than 6000 Connecticut customers were without power Monday morning according to Eversource but that had dropped to 270 at 5:17 p.m.

On Monday morning about 8:30 the utility company was reporting 1038 outages in Ledyard 593 in Stonington 21 in New London and 35 in East Lyme. Much of the power was restored later in the morning and afternoon. As of 5:17 p.m. Monday East Lyme had 127 customers without power North Stonington 66 and Stonington and Lyme 20 each. Ledyard outages had been reduced to just 9.

Norwich Public Utilities reported a few scattered outages Monday morning. About 100 customers lost power in the area of Quarto Road when a tree limb fell across wires at 7:30 a.m. About 30 NPU customers in the area of Lillibridge and Victoria roads and Pacemaker Avenue lost power at about 7 a.m. and were restored by 9:30 a.m.

Mathewson Mill Road was closed in Ledyard near the Preston line while downed wires lay across the roadway according to the Ledyard Police Department. The traffic signal at Colonel Ledyard Highway and Center Groton Road was also out on Monday morning. In North Stonington downed power lines near the intersection of Route 184 and Boombridge Road caused some road closures.

East Lyme Police Chief Mike Finkelstein said Monday morning that Atlantic Avenue was closed between Bayview Road and Columbus Avenue from the flooding. Most of the deluge began about two hours prior to high tide.

Joe Bragaw East Lyme's public works director said a girls' weekend at an Airbnb rental on Atlantic Avenue culminated with a ride on a town backhoe when the women had to be escorted to dry land Monday morning.

""These things happen where people are on vacation thinking everything is going to be fine and all of a sudden there's three feet of water and they gotta get out"" he said.

With the low-lying road sitting just about a foot above the high tide line as the wet gusty storm came in from the east Bragaw said there weren't a lot of options for getting the women out of the house.

""The guys as they usually do they figured it out"" he said of his highway crew.

He said a lot of the other waterfront homes are vacant over the winter with the remaining year-rounders accustomed to riding it out until the water goes back where it came from.

As for the backhoe he described it as an uncommon form of public transportation for beach residents especially seven women in town for a party.

""Not seven ladies in for the weekend for a party"" he said. ""It's not your typical Airbnb experience.""

Finkelstein said around 4 p.m. there was about 6 inches of flooding still on the ground. The public works department remained on the scene. He said there has also been significant flooding in the parking lot of Cini Park. On North Bride Brook Road the wind blew down a utility pole Monday morning forcing the closure of the road from after 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. he said.

Groton Town Police said River Road north of Bindloss Road in Mystic and Poquonnock Road/Route 1 in the area of South Road in downtown Groton were flooded and impassable Monday morning due to the rain and high tide. There was also flooding in downtown Mystic that closed roads a common occurence with coastal storms.

City of Groton Police said Shore Avenue was impassable for a time and the Eastern Point Beach parking lot was under water.

Day staff writers Kimberly Drelich and Elizabeth Regan contributed to this report.

Here's what you can do to make space,"Is your smartphone’s storage full? Don’t worry it doesn’t take a lot of time to free up some space on the device. The companies launch devices with 64GB or 128GB as base variants that get filled up in no time because the usage of apps has increased in years. People have thousands of photos and videos on their phone which is not surprising. If your device doesn’t have support for a microSD card slot for storage expansion don’t panic! There are several ways to make space for upcoming content. Here is what you can do.

Use Google Play Store to delete apps

-Did you know that you could use Google Play Store to clean your phone's storage? You might be surprised but this is true. All you need to do is open the app and tap on your profile > Manage apps & device. Now tap again on the storage part where the app mentions how much space your apps have used. Here you will be able to see the apps that you have downloaded and how much space each one of them is consuming.

You can then select the apps that you want to delete. You can select the ones that you don’t use very often and are just filling up your storage space. For this just tick on the boxes located on the right side of the screen and tap on the dustbin icon > Uninstall. Before you do that the Play Store app even shows how much space you will be clearing by deleting the selected apps. This is the easiest way to delete a bunch of apps in one go.

Delete large files in one go

Every smartphone has Google’s Files app. Just search for it on your smartphone. When you open it you will notice tags on the top of the apps including Images Audio Videos and more. You just need to swipe left on the tags until you find “Large files.” Tap on it and the app will show you all the large files that you have on your smartphone. You can then delete the ones that are no longer important.

It should be noted that the Files app by default opens the Downloads section and will show you large files accordingly. For videos or photos just tap on the hamburger icon located on the top-left corner. You can then go to any section and tap on “Large files” tag to delete big files. All this will clear a lot of storage space at once.

Use WhatsApp Storage manager

WhatsApp is one of the most popular apps and is used by millions of Indians to exchange messages/photos. People get a lot of unwanted photos or videos on WhatsApp that get saved on their phone's Gallery app. So to quickly delete photos or any other media you can use the messaging app's storage manager. Just open the app and go to Settings > Storage and data > Manage storage. Here you will see a section of files that are larger than 5MB. You can tap on it and delete unnecessary files photos and videos in one go. You can also visit other sections in Storage manager to clean more space.

Store photos to cloud and delete them from Gallery

Another way to clean your smartphone’s storage space is to back up all the photos or videos to a cloud service. You can use the Google Photos app which comes pre-installed with every smartphone. If you are already using this cloud storage service to back up your media then you can simply delete all the photos from your phone’s Gallery app. But before that just double-check the Google Photos app on any other device and see if everything is backed up otherwise you will lose your data.

For those who haven’t Google Photos app yet just open it on your smartphone and enable the backup feature located in the profile section of the app. Now tap on the profile icon and tap again on “Turn on backup” option. The app will then show different picture quality options and you should select “Original quality” to preserve their quality. The storage saver option will degrade the quality of your images. You are all set now. The screen should show that Google has started backing up your photos/videos. After backing up to this service you will be able to access your photos and videos across all the devices by just signing in to your Google account.

Clear cache of apps

Lastly if you still want more storage space then you can consider clearing the cache of the apps. Note that here I’m talking about Cache and not the user data. So don’t make the mistake of clearing data of the app by tapping on Clear Storage. It is safe to clear Cache for apps. All you need to do is go to the phone’s Settings section > Apps > tap on any app > tap on Storage > Clear Cache.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZW5idWlsZGluZ2VsZW1lbnRzLmNvbS9ob3ctbXVjaC1kb2VzLWEtbW9kdWxhci1idWlsZGluZy1jb3N0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Much Does a Modular Building Cost Right Now?,"A McGraw-Hill construction report showed that the construction industry experienced improved efficiency due to modular buildings. Consequently many people turn to prefabricated buildings for several advantages including construction speed flexibility and sustainability.

Looking at this growing interest you may wonder about modular building costs. The piece below covers the prices of different modular structures enabling you to understand this expanding market better.

How Much Do Modular Buildings Cost?

Modular buildings can cost anywhere between $50 to more than $400. The structure type size and customization needs determine the price tag you get. Thus the more changes involved per square foot you want the higher the ultimate cost will be.

You can find three primary modular categories with different price ranges and they are:

Temporary Modular Buildings Permanent Modular Buildings Custom Modular Buildings

Lets explore each of these below.

Temporary Modular Buildings

Many people often misunderstand the label “temporary” in this building type thinking it points to the structure’s construction and design. On the contrary it describes the building’s foundation type and its intended utility. It also refers to how the structure attaches to the foundation. Hence temporary buildings feature an ergonomic design that lets you relocate them several times during their service life.

You can efficiently disconnect and remove the structure making it a popular choice for enterprises requiring extra space for a limited time. Besides these buildings incorporate steel exteriors although most of the construction predominantly involves wooden materials.

Temporary modular buildings cost approximately $50 to $100 for each square foot. However this tag may not necessarily include site preparation delivery and setup costs. Notably many businesses prefer to lease temporary modular buildings rather than purchase them due to their short lifespan.

It is essential to note that temporary modular buildings also offer used options. These structures present affordable selections since you are not buying a new building. You also have a shorter waiting time since they are ready-made.

Another major benefit used buildings give is allowing you to see the structure before committing to it ascertaining that you get what you want. You can also enjoy their shorter lease terms while financing one-time charges throughout the contract including delivery installation and disassembly costs.

Permanent Modular Buildings

Unlike the temporary options permanent modular buildings incorporate a design to support long-term utility at the same place. Many companies also opt to buy these structures rather than lease them with most transactions taking approximately four months from contract signing to the reception of your building. The permanent modular buildings feature wood or steel framing and come in II-B II-A or V-B structures.

Additionally the permanent versions do not provide a one-size-fits-all price. Your level of customization project complexity and kind of structure affects your overall costs. For instance a permanent modular building with full customization can charge anywhere from $100 to more than $300 per square foot. On the other hand a B-type structure with a more basic design can cost from $50 to $100 for each square foot.

Custom Modular Buildings

Custom modular buildings allow you to work with an engineering and design team to construct a structure made to address your requirements and specifications. You can personalize various aspects of the structure according to your business needs including siding materials flooring roofing materials design and handicap accessibility features.

The personalized details result in varying prices ranging from $70 to over $400 per square foot. You can get lower prices when making small changes to the modular structures. However you can go as high as your budget permits if you desire more customization in your modules.

Factors that Affect Modular Buildings Costs

Like traditional construction modular buildings also have certain factors affecting the costs. Their prices generally involve the delivery setup and dismounting charges. You also get additional expenses if you create your modular building from scratch. Understanding these aspects ensures you can make better decisions before identifying the most suitable modular structure and size for your requirements.

The material types used are among the factors affecting your overall modular building costs. For example temporary modular buildings primarily integrate wood into their structures resulting in lower costs than their permanent counterparts. The permanent modular buildings mainly incorporate steel materials into the frames and exterior sections to deliver higher construction and maintenance costs.

You can also experience cost differences depending on whether you buy or lease the modular building. Leasing typically offers lower rates than purchasing due to its different benefits such as flexibility shorter-term contracts and availability. Buying a modular building has higher expenses since it features durable and at times customized designs to meet your long-term demands.

Another factor influencing modular building costs is customization requirements. You can add and adjust the modules’ designs according to your preferences and needs when selecting a modular structure. Hence more modifications demand extra expenses.

Notably some elements can influence the schedule and cost of modular building projects to derail your plans including inadequate coordination and contractual disputes. Such derailments mean you waste time resources and labor while extending your project timeline to incur extra expenses.

Cost of Leasing a Modular Building

The structure type customization and project complexity determine the prices typically ranging from $1 to $1.50 per square foot every month. As a result your cost varies depending on your preferred lease length building size location supply and demand and one-time charges.

Your contract’s length significantly affects modular building cost and thus it is essential to know how long you intend to utilize the borrowed space.

The provider can precisely determine your monthly rental rate when you properly estimate your utility period. Generally shorter-term contracts have a higher monthly rate whereas longer leases provide reduced charges.

The building size configuration and type determine the price you pay for your lease since different needs demand different solutions. For instance you can expect a different price tag when choosing a modular structure containing a restroom over one that does not have one. The stackable and panelized options also have a different cost than the conventional mobile spaces.

Your location can also influence the contract terms where it costs more to get the modular structure in an urban area than in a more remote setting. Besides the supply and demand in your area can considerably impact your leasing costs. Modular buildings support several industries leading to a shortage and higher price tags during the peak seasons.

Should I Lease or Purchase a Modular Building?

Aside from the modular building cost it is necessary to consider some factors to know whether leasing or purchasing the structure is right for you. “Can I wait for the structure’s construction from the start?” “Do I want customized modules?” “How long do I need the structure?”

You want to buy a modular building if you plan to utilize the structure at another site in the future or use it for over 3 years. Conversely it is generally advisable to lease the building if you do not own the commercial property lack perfect credit have a tight budget and intend to use the structure for 6 to 36 months.

Here are some advantages and disadvantages of leasing and purchasing a modular building to aid you in determining the best option for your needs.

Pros of Purchasing a Modular Building

• Purchasing is cheaper than a traditional construction project

• It maximizes energy efficiency

• Purchasing minimizes inspection hassle

• It has a fast construction time

• Prefabricated buildings eliminate wastage of excess materials

Cons of Purchasing a Modular Building

• Difficulty moving and handling modules

• Lack of storage space after use

• Extra expenses customizing the modules for future needs

Pros of Modular Building Leases

• It reduces responsibility for major repairs

• Leasing is flexible and convenient

• It offers an eco-friendly option

• Leasing provides quick occupancy

• It is more affordable

Cons of Modular Building Leases

• Lower aesthetic quality on used structures

• A design that is not fully user-specific

• Perception issues due to historical performance

Modular Building vs. Traditional Construction Cost

Modular building and traditional construction have multiple differences helping you find the suitable option for your budget needs. Generally the former offers lower overall operating costs than the latter to make it ideal when you have limited financing. Modular buildings enable you to reduce expenses compared to traditional construction in three primary ways: construction time labor costs and tax requirements.

For instance it can take around 60 to 90 days to complete a modular building’s construction. This speed shortens your project timeline by up to 35% compared to traditional building ventures. Modular buildings enable site development and structure construction to occur simultaneously. As a result you experience fewer delays from interruptions such as weather conditions to speed up the construction and have lower final modular buildings cost.

In addition you can save extra expenses via modular buildings that you would otherwise spend on energy and labor to achieve traditional construction. The reduced project timeline and interruptions let your constructors use their resources and energy optimally lowering the on-site costs.

Aside from these the tax ramifications of conventional construction typically depreciate over 35 years. However tax regulations present favorable depreciation on all modular structures qualifying for a 7-year depreciation period.

This benefit results from the modular buildings’ flexibility that enables you to disassemble relocate and re-install them. Therefore the mobility allows these structures to qualify as tangible property under the MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) with a shorter depreciable life.",,,,,,

The 135000-bpd Pipestill-7 CDU is being temporarily shut for a planned maintenance said a spokesperson with ExxonMobil.

The Baytown refinery Exxon's largest in the United States and the fourth largest in the nation continues to operate at reduced production levels following a Dec. 23 explosion in which four contractors were injured.

Recently commenting in a Twitter statement Rohan Davis ExxonMobil's Baytown refinery manager said the incident was still under investigation.

""We are committed to finding out what happened through a full and thorough investigation and continue to cooperate with authorities"" said Davis. ""Taking the time to thoroughly investigate any cause or causes is essential. We thank you all for your continued patience and understanding.""

Last week’s column wrapped up my rather extended revisit of the Buxton Proposal BP. This task started on Sunday September 26 and took thirteen columns which is much longer than I had originally envisaged. Consequently except for very brief references to this topic going forward I do not anticipate having to engage this topic substantially again. Starting today I propose to introduce some analytical and theoretical work of a more or less academic orientation that I firmly believe could aid the general readership’s comprehension of the complex occurrences which have manifested themselves thus far as Guyana’s petroleum industry rapidly progresses.

More to the point my task can be formally expressed as seeking: to advance an hypothesis or formularization which provides a general explanation or reasoned construct that correctly expresses the ruling or governing dynamic which most fittingly captures the clearly unprecedented historical emergence of Guyana’s world-class petroleum finds/discoveries starting with ExxonMobil’s announcement in May 2015 and projected to last comfortably up to the end of Guyana’s first decade of oil and gas sector production [2025/26]. Despite start-up setbacks there has been a steadily emerging consensus backed by finds that on its present trajectory Guyana’s daily rate of crude oil production DROP will reach around one million barrels of oil equivalent per day; that is 1mln boe/d.

The tasks I have set for myself will be addressed in four sections as indicated in what follows and are constructed around four analytical pillars (A-D). These are: A) the formulization of a general explanation of the unprecedented and explosive growth in Guyana’s creaming curve for petroleum finds/discoveries in the period from the First Discovery [mid- 2015] to Guyana’s First Oil [December 2019]; B) articulating the essential or ruling condition of ExxonMobil which is presently and continues to be the lead firm lead contractor and lead operator located mainly but not exclusively in the Stabroek Block for the entirety of the period of my analysis—that is the first full decade of Guyana’s oil and gas sector [mid-2015] to [2025/26]; and pillars C and D focus principally on those actions I am advising the Authorities to take. Thus C refers to recommendations which I have made repeatedly in regard to the Natural Resource Fund NRF; my proposal to establish a National Oil Company NOC; advice on whether to join OPEC or not; local content requirements LCRs; and finally the Buxton Proposal which I have revisited over the past 13 weeks. Similarly D refers to improved revenue capture governance and public openness in the face of relentless noise and nonsense in the local social and print media

For convenience Schedule 1 below captures the schema described above and from which the analysis will flow going forward.

Schedule 1 – Analytic Pillars [A-D]

KEY: NOC= National Oil Company; LCRs= Local content requirements; BP=Buxton Proposal; NRF= National Resources Fund.

Pillar 1 which I start addressing in today’s column offers a general thesis that explains the essence of Guyana’s recent world class offshore petroleum discoveries. The data reveal that to date all the recoverable discoveries have been located in the Stabroek Block and of immense importance all are under the operational control of ExxonMobil and its partners; the lead Contractor and Operator. As I had earlier observed in this Sunday column series two other joint venture groups (JVs) have been recognized as being on the cusp of production However I believe their reported data give cause for considerable uncertainty on this score.

As far back as half a decade ago in 2016 when reported discoveries by ExxonMobil and partners were less than one billion barrels of oil equivalent BoE I was predicting that Guyana’s discoveries would eventually reach 13-15 billion BoE. In truth that prediction was based on a combination of 1) gut feelings and intuition and 2) two lines of reasoning that flowed from my research into research of Guyana’s petroleum studies back in 2015. The first of the two reasonings is the “Atlantic mirror image” geological principle; and the second reasoning has been derived from two United States Geological Service (USGS) Fact Sheets which were released in 2000 and 2012.

World Class Petroleum Finds

ExxonMobil has announced 27 discoveries and continues to suggest its total recoverable resources is 10+ bln boe. Presently my assessment of Guyana’s petroleum reserves potential still stands at 13-15 billion boe and 23-43 billion cubic feet of natural gas and natural gas liquids. I readily admit that this is a high prediction. To compare Wikipedia’s ranking of countries with proven oil reserves lists Brazil 15th (with a holding of 13.0 billion boe); Algeria is 16th (12.2 billion boe); and Angola and Ecuador 17th and 18th (with 8.3 billion boe). These data are revealed in Table below.

My estimate is supported by two lines of argument. Firstly an appreciation of Guyana’s petroleum geological principle of the “Atlantic mirror image”. Secondly estimates provided by the USGS.

Conclusion

Next week I continue to document in minimal detail the hard data on Guyana’s world-class discoveries and from which I have developed my analysis based on the twin constructs of happenstance and the zombie character of ExxonMobil which is the lead contractor and operator.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVhZHZvY2F0ZS5jb20vYmF0b25fcm91Z2UvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudF9saWZlL2NvbW11bml0eS1jYXNhLXNlbGVjdHMtbmV3LWJvYXJkLW1lbWVycy10b3JjaGJlYXJlci1iZXRhLWNyb3ducy1zd2VldGhlYXJ0L2FydGljbGVfM2E3YzM2MDQtNmYzNC0xMWVjLTllY2MtYmZhYWQwODUwNzQwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Community: CASA selects new board memers; Torchbearer Beta crowns sweetheart,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

The S&P 500's 2022 struggles continued as bank stocks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season by reporting mixed numbers.

On Tuesday Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee as part of his reconfirmation process. Powell said persistently elevated inflation is a signal the U.S. economy ""no longer needs or wants"" highly accommodative monetary policy measures but added that the ""era of very low interest rates"" is likely here to stay.

Following Powell's testimony the U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday that the consumer price index increased by 7% in December the highest inflation recorded since 1982. The CPI reading was up 0.5% compared with November and in line with economist estimates.

On Monday video game developer Take-Two Interactive announced a $12.7 billion buyout of Zynga maker of popular social media game ""FarmVille."" The $9.86-per-share buyout price represented a 64% premium to Zynga's previous week's closing share price.

Casino stocks Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts rallied on Friday after the Macau government released a draft of a new bill outlining the license renewal process for Macau casino operators. Macau will maintain a maximum of six total licenses suggesting it's likely the current six Macau operators will all have their licenses renewed for 10 years.

JPMorgan withdrawal

Shares of U.S. megabank JPMorgan Chase dropped more than 5% on Friday morning after the company reported a fourth quarter earnings beat but cut its 2022 financial guidance and said ""inflationary pressures"" will increase expenses by 8% this year.

Investors will get more fourth-quarter earnings numbers in the week ahead including reports from Bank of America UnitedHealth and Procter & Gamble on Wednesday and Netflix on Thursday.

S&P 500 companies are on track to report full-year 2021 earnings growth of 45.3% according to FactSet.

Economic numbers

In the week ahead investors will get key economic updates from Asia on Monday when the National Bureau of Statistics of China releases its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate and on Friday when the People's Bank of China releases its latest interest rate decision.

Photos and videos showing piles of empty boxes littered alongside rail tracks in Los Angeles County California have gone viral as shipping companies say they’ve seen a dramatic spike in railroad theft. Some of the boxes are packages from companies like UPS Amazon and FedEx.

Union Pacific one of the country’s largest railroad companies says it may avoid operating in Los Angeles County following the spike in thefts which it blames on lax prosecution of crimes. The containers and trains are locked but can be broken into.

Union Pacific said last month in a letter to the Los Angeles District Attorney that it saw a 160% year-over-year increase in theft in LA county. The company claims that a December 2020 special directive issued by District Attorney George Gascón that changed how low-level offenses are prosecuted has contributed to the uptick.

Union Pacific said in its letter that in the last three months of the year it made over 100 arrests of “active criminals vandalizing our trains” in partnership with the LA police department and Los Angeles Sherriff department. But Union Pacific which has its own police department with jurisdiction over the 32000 miles of tracks it owns said that even as it has expanded its security resources and partnered more closely with local law enforcement the problem isn’t going away. After being arrested individuals are released from custody within 24 hours it said.

Crime is associated with increases in poverty which has increased during the pandemic. The county’s directive was intended to combat social ills that come from misdemeanor convictions such as difficulties with employment housing education government benefits and immigration.

“Studies show that prosecution of the offenses driving the bulk of misdemeanor cases have minimal or even negative long-term impacts on public safety” Gascón said when the directive was issued.

“Our office is committed to working with law enforcement to ensure collective safety across Los Angeles County’s sprawling infrastructure whether it’s at our ports or on railroad tracks” Alex Bastian Special Advisor to District Attorney Gascón said when reached for comment.

“Some cases presented to our office by Union Pacific have been filed such as burglary and grand theft while others have been declined due to insufficient evidence. We make charging decisions based on the evidence. Our office takes Union Pacific’s concerns seriously and hopes to discuss this issue more in the coming weeks” he added.

“While we understand the well-intended social justice goals of the policy we need our justice system to support our partnership efforts with local law enforcement hold these criminals accountable and most important help protect our employees and the critical local and national rail network” Guerrero said.

The Association of American Railroads expressed concern about the crime increase.

“In coordination with local law and where necessary federal law enforcement partners the industry is committed to pursuing all avenues necessary to address this criminal behavior” spokesman Ted Greener said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9kZWNvZGVkLXdoeS1pcy1mZWRleC1kZW1hbmRpbmctdG8tZXF1aXAtaXRzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXdpdGgtYW50aS1taXNzaWxlLWxhc2VyLWRlZmVuc2Utc3lzdGVtL9IBhgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9kZWNvZGVkLXdoeS1pcy1mZWRleC1kZW1hbmRpbmctdG8tZXF1aXAtaXRzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXdpdGgtYW50aS1taXNzaWxlLWxhc2VyLWRlZmVuc2Utc3lzdGVtLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DECODED: Why Is FedEx Looking To Equip Its Airbus A321 Aircraft With Anti-Missile Laser Defense System?,"While infrared countermeasure systems are not usually associated with commercial aviation the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and delivery giant FedEx have shown interest in its capability in the commercial aircraft space.

Delivery company FedEx has put forth a request to federal regulators to acquire permission for installing infrared countermeasures atop its cargo jets which can thwart the threats posed by anti-air missiles. The proposal to equip the cargo jets with missile defense systems was filed by the FAA with the US Department of Transportation on January 14.

“In recent years in several incidents abroad civilian aircraft were fired upon by man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS)” FedEx was quoted as saying in the document released by the FAA. “This has led several companies to design and adapt systems like a laser-based missile-defense system for installation on civilian aircraft to protect those aircraft against heat-seeking missiles” it added.

The company explained that it wanted to equip its aircraft with a missile defense system that can direct infrared laser energy in the direction of incoming missiles. This would act as an interruption in the missile’s tracking of the heat produced by the aircraft.

FedEx also acknowledged the fact that infrared laser energy poses a great danger to the people on board the aircraft people present on the ground and also to other aircraft. The laser energy system will require the approval of the FAA NBC reported.

The Laser-Based Missile Countermeasure

FedEx is planning to fit its aircraft with a Directional Infrared Countermeasure system (DIRCM). The DIRCM is a self-defense system that is widely used by the military for its transport aircraft and helicopters.

Reports suggest that this technology is now also being received by fighter jets. These infrared countermeasures work by firing laser beams of infrared (IR) light in the direction of incoming missiles.

This either results in the blinding of the seekers of these missiles or they are able to divert the missile from the aircraft which was being targeted by them CNN reported.

According to reports FedEx plans to install the DIRCM on its Airbus A321-200 which is the long-range variant of the A321 commonly used as a commercial passenger aircraft. The A321-200 is not currently being operated by FedEx which has a fleet of more than 650 aircraft however the aircraft is being eyed upon by a number of major freight companies for conducting future cargo operations.

The testing of anti-missile countermeasures was commenced by FedEx back in the year 2006. At that time the company had installed a McDonnell Douglas MD-10 with Northrop Grumman’s pod-based Guardian DIRCM system which was based on the AN/AAQ-24 DIRCM.

The design of the Fed-Ex-specific system was created by Northrop Grumman in collaboration with FedEx itself for fitting it onto a canoe-shaped ventral pod which was easily detachable and added a drag as little as possible.

The system featured a laser turret and missile approaching sensors which provided the laser turret with 360-degree warning and cueing.

This installation was a part of the Department of Homeland Security’s Counter-MANPADS Program which was meant for developing and demonstrating anti-missile systems suitable for commercial aircraft.

During the course of the program two different directional infrared countermeasure systems the Northrop Grumman Guardian and the BAE Systems JetEye were tested by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) against 29 MANPADS systems.

However this is not going to be the first time when anti-missile systems are being installed on a commercial aircraft. Such systems have been installed on US commercial aircraft as far back as 2008.

Even before that in the year 2004 an Israeli airline known as El Al became the only commercial airline that had installed anti-missile systems on its aircraft. However these systems were not DIRCM but were flare-based.

Dangers of the flares igniting fires on the ground as well as its extremely volatile nature persuaded the airlines to shift to the laser-based C-MUSIC system. The C-MUSIC is the world’s first DIRCM system installed on transport aircraft in regular commercial service as claimed by Elbit Systems.

Why are Anti-Missile Systems Needed on Commercial Aircraft?

Since the year 1970 the International Civil Aviation Organization has reported 42 civilian aircraft which were struck by MANPADS systems. One of these instances was when an Israeli airliner with 250 passengers on board was struck by shrapnel of a suspended MANPADS missile just when it took off from Mombasa Kenya in November 2002.

However the aircraft managed to make a safe landing in Tel Aviv and reported minimal damage.

Another instance was in the year 2003 when a DHL cargo plane which was flying from Iraq to Bahrain was compelled to make an emergency landing after it was struck by a MANPADS missile that had hit the aircraft’s left-wing.

Even though the aircraft suffered extreme damage to its wing and had completely lost its hydraulic control its three-men crew managed to return to Baghdad where they landed the aircraft by controlling it solely through varying engine thrust.

As suggested by the FAA’s filing these anti-missile systems do pose a certain degree of threat to commercial air traffic.

As the cargo transport company is planning to create special conditions in order to equip the DIRCM on an aircraft which it is not yet operating it is being speculated that the company might be planning to use the system to conduct operations in very specific cases or routes. This could offer great benefits as such a capability will make it possible for the freight company to operate in high-risk areas as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9mZWQtZXgtYW50aS1taXNzaWxlLWxhc2VyLXByb3Bvc2FsLTE4MjE1OTQyNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx wants to equip cargo aircraft with anti-missile lasers,"FedEx jets might soon pack defensive weaponry. NBC News and Reuters report FedEx has asked the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to equip an upcoming fleet of Airbus A321-200 aircraft with an anti-missile laser system. The proposed hardware would disrupt the tracking on heat-seeking missiles by steering infrared laser energy toward the oncoming projectiles.

The courier service pointed to ""several"" foreign incidents where attackers used portable air defense systems against civilian aircraft. While there weren't specific examples NBC pointed to Iran shooting down a Ukranian airliner in January 2020 (reportedly due to mistaking the jet for a cruise missile) and a Malaysian flight brought down by Russia-backed Ukranian separatists in July 2014.

FedEx first applied for the laser system in October 2019. The FAA is open to approval but has proposed ""special conditions"" before lasers could enter service. The system would need failsafes to prevent activation on the ground and couldn't cause harm to any aircraft or people.

The concept of including countermeasures isn't strictly new. Some American commercial aircraft have used anti-missile systems as early as 2008 and FedEx helped trial a Northrop Grumman countermeasure system around the same time. Israel's El Al has used anti-missile systems since 2004. FedEx's plans would be significant though and rare for a courier company. It wouldn't be surprising if more commercial aircraft followed suit even if the risks of attacks remain relatively low.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mZWRleC1hbnRpLW1pc3NpbGUtbGFzZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx Looks To Add Anti-Missile Lasers To Its Planes,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mZWRleC1hbnRpLW1pc3NpbGUtbGFzZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZmVkZXgtc2Vla3MtZmFhLWFwcHJvdmFsLWFudGktbWlzc2lsZS1sYXNlcnMtMjAyMi0x0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9mZWRleC1zZWVrcy1mYWEtYXBwcm92YWwtYW50aS1taXNzaWxlLWxhc2Vycy0yMDIyLTE_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx seeks FAA approval to install anti-missile lasers on jets,"Fedex DC-10 Carlos Yudica/Shutterstock

FedEx is looking to install anti-missile lasers on some of its jets according to a proposal it sent to the FAA.

The request submitted for government approval back in 2019 is atypical for commercial and civilian planes.

The FAA will hear public comment for 45 days before making its decision on allowing FedEx to adapt the tech.

FedEx is looking to outfit some cargo planes with a unique protective measure — anti-missile laser technology.

The Federal Aviation Association (FAA) said in a filing on Friday it is currently reviewing a request from FedEx to add infrared laser technology to some aircraft. The technology is designed to project a laser outside the plane that counters and disrupts a missile's heat-seeking capabilities.

""In recent years in several incidents abroad civilian aircraft were fired upon by man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS)"" the FAA document reads. ""This has led several companies to design and adapt systems like a laser-based missile-defense system for installation on civilian aircraft to protect those aircraft against heat-seeking missiles.""

In 2003 a surface-to-air missile hit the left wing of an Airbus A330 operating for DHL just after takeoff from Baghdad Iraq but crew were able to escape unharmed. In 2014 a missile attack took out a Malaysia Airlines plane over Ukraine killing 298 passengers.

According to the filing the tech will be adapted onto the Airbus Model A321-200 — a twin-engine transportation jet with seating for 220 passengers. FedEx operates the worlds largest cargo air fleet with more than 650 total planes but it currently does not own or operate any A321-200 aircraft.

FedEx did not respond to Insider's request for comment.

The feature which the FAA document described as ""novel"" and ""unusual"" is not typically seen on non-military aircraft. The FAA's current design standards are not able to accommodate this technology the filing also said and the agency has no basis to determine whether the system will perform as intended.

""Infrared laser energy can pose a hazard to persons on the aircraft on the ground and another aircraft"" the filing also said citing several adverse affects on flight personnel and airport equipment. ""The risk is high because infrared light is invisible to the human eye.""

Though the FAA and Department of Transportation made the filing public on Friday the proposal was originally submitted by FedEx in October 2019.

""With the modifications on [the aircraft] the FAA keeps careful track of anything that is done to a jet that might impact its flight characteristics"" said Richard Aboulafia a managing director at Aerospace consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.

FedEx could be looking at this as a one-off experiment purchasing an A321 and testing the technology to see if it wants to add it to more of the company's fleet Aboulafia told Insider. The company could also be planning on purchasing some A321 planes as part of a civil reserve aircraft fleet that the military could employ in hostile territories he added.

The US government and other civilian American airlines have looked into adding their similar countermeasures to civilian flights for nearly two decades though high cost and low risk of domestic missile attacks eventually dissuaded them.







Aviation regulators will spend 45 days hearing public comment it approves the infrared laser system."

The Green Party's motto is ""Ready – because you are."" So where better than this Green stronghold to take the lead on sustainability and help Germany achieve climate neutrality as quickly as possible?

In 2008 the Black Forest city of Freiburg (population: 230000) rather grandiosely adopted the title of ""Green City."" It likes to describe itself as the environmental capital of Germany. With 1800 hours of sunshine a year this southwestern city is a big promoter of solar energy in line with Habeck's plans.

It already boasts a great many showcase projects: Freiburg's new city hall was one of the first in the world to be conceived as a zero-energy building with 800 solar panels on the facade. The new soccer stadium has a world-beating solar installation on the stadium roof. The archdiocese of Freiburg aims to be the first in Germany to reduce the church's CO2 emissions to zero.

As the new climate protection minister Robert Habeck wants to make Germany climate-neutral by 2045. And as so often Freiburg is ahead of the game: It hopes to achieve this seven years earlier in 2038.

Freiburg: solar energy pioneer

Franziska Breyer works in the climate neutrality department at the Environmental Protection Office. She's probably one of the best people to explain how Freiburg has come to lead the field on climate protection. A trained forester and a child of the anti-nuclear movement she will be setting out Freiburg's climate protection policy to other cities as part of an online conference on Monday. ""We're one of the top ten cities in Germany in our commitment to climate protection"" Breyer says.

""Climate protection is not just an environmental issue; it must be taken into consideration at all levels"" - Franziska Breyer Image: Oliver Pieper/DW

From 2023 onward Freiburg intends to pump €12 million ($13.7 million) a year into additional climate protection measures regardless of the budget constraints resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Robert Habeck wants to make it a requirement for commercial buildings in Germany to be fitted with solar panels. In the state of Baden-Württemberg where Freiburg is located this is already obligatory.

The city is also creating a new neighborhood. The Dietenbach district in western Freiburg will provide homes for around 15000 people – climate-neutral homes of course. ""Nothing will be burned there anymore; no biomass no pellets no oil no gas"" Breyer explains. ""The whole district will be heated by heat pumps and waste heat from a sewage canal and the energy will be supplied by photovoltaic panels.""

More cyclists than drivers

As with so many of her fellow Freiburgers climate protection is in Breyer's DNA. She proudly reports that Lonely Planet the well-known publisher of travel guides puts Freiburg at number 3 on its list of top travel destinations for 2022 just after Auckland and Taipei. ""The charismatic environmentally conscious Black Forest metropolis can show many of us a few more tricks on how to live responsibly"" it reports.

Breyer illustrates one of these tricks with a diagram about the modal split or mobility behavior. 40 years ago just 15% of Freiburg's residents used bicycles as their main mode of transport. Now it's one in three. Over the same period the proportion of car drivers dropped from 39% to 21%. ""That puts us ahead of all other German cities. But we still have too many cars being registered – we still have too many cars.""

Vauban: A model neighborhood in the model city

Take the streetcar from the city center head south for quarter of an hour and you'll get a taste of how well city life can function almost without cars. Freiburg's model district of Vauban was built on the site of a former French barracks named after an architect who worked for the French Sun King Louis XIV. The lifestyle enjoyed by its 5600 inhabitants for more than 20 years may soon become the German standard.

Almost car-free: Freiburg's model district of Vauban Image: Oliver Pieper/DW

Vauban is Freiburg times ten: even greener even more ecological even more bicycle-friendly. There are brightly colored ""passive"" (ultra-low-energy) houses with solar panels on the roof while a wood-fired thermal power plant supplies all the residents with electricity. Vauban has wide pavements and cycle paths as well as designated play streets – a paradise for children. The few residents who own cars literally hide them in one of the two parking garages on the outskirts. At Expo 2010 in Shanghai Vauban was named one of the 60 best neighborhoods in the world to live in.

Excellent transport links and everything within reach

Andreas Konietzny was one of the first residents. The Düsseldorf-born architect moved to Vauban in 2001 and has never regretted it. ""My sister was living in California at the time; once when she was visiting she made a note of how many steps she took to get to the supermarket the stream the elementary school. Her American friends didn't believe her when she told them it felt as if everything here was only 400 meters away. There you have to get in the car to do everything.""

In this neighborhood of short distances which has everything except cars Konietzny shares a car with another family. It's parked in the underground garage 300 meters from his house and sometimes it waits for him there for weeks. Streetcar number 3 goes right to the city center – one every minute. Every year Vauban is visited by tens of thousands of tourists from all over the world. They like to stay at the sustainable Green City Hotel which has plants climbing the outside walls and interiors decorated with local wood.

The cost of a climate protection paradise

However there is a downside to the dream of an exemplary green life in Freiburg and Vauban and it should not be underestimated. It's incredibly expensive. Only in Munich and Frankfurt do tenants pay out more in rent than they do in Freiburg. The main criticism of the German climate protection minister's ambitious proposals is that for many Germans they're simply unaffordable.

Vauban does now have some blocks of affordable student housing but the majority of residents fit the pattern of well-heeled well-educated environmentally aware citizens. ""A lot of teachers and architects like me live here now and the flip side of this is gentrification"" says Konietzny. ""In the beginning there was a different mix of residents. It's sad to see that people with less money can't afford to live here anymore.""

Can Germany do more on climate protection?

Rolf Disch has been eagerly awaiting Robert Habeck's climate protection initiative for a very long time. A pioneer of solar technology an award-winning architect and visionary his office in Vauban is in a building fittingly named the Sun Ship.

The ""Sun Ship"" office building in Vauban designed by the architect and solar technology pioneer Rolf Disch Image: Harold Cunningham/Getty Images

Disch now 77 is every bit as passionate about the transition to renewable energy as he was in the 1980s when he developed the world's first solar recharging station became a world champion solar car driver and drove across Australia in his 100%-solar-powered vehicle. ""I've been saying for a long time that Germany could be climate neutral as early as 2030 if it wanted to be"" he points out.

Political fiasco in the solar industry

From his balcony Disch gazes down proudly on the 59 colorful wooden houses that make up Vauban's Solar Settlement – his baby. They're all ""PlusEnergy"" houses a design the architect came up with in 1994 meaning that they produce more energy than they use. It's quite shocking to see how advanced Germany was in terms of climate protection almost 30 years ago yet how carelessly it squandered this advantage. It was only recently that PlusEnergy houses were awarded the highest level of subsidy: €37500 per residential unit.

Ask Rolf Disch about Germany's climate protection efforts and he gets very worked up. He has been pleading with politicians for decades to increase their focus on renewable energies. He takes out a petition in favor of PlusEnergy that he sent to Chancellor Angela Merkel 12 years ago: It garnered 4500 signatures.

However this too had no success. On the contrary: In 2012 the German government decided to curtail support for photovoltaics and the market collapsed by 80%. ""They destroyed an entire industry and thousands of jobs"" says Disch. ""We almost collapsed here in Freiburg too – despite being a world leader in solar technology. To this day I still don't understand it.""

PlusEnergy houses still far from standard

But Disch has bounced back. He's currently working on his next project: Four PlusEnergy houses comprising a total of 83 apartments are being built in nearby Schallstadt south-west of Freiburg – financed by Disch himself. ""I don't yet know how this is going to work economically how it will pay for itself. We're doing it because we believe in it.""

It's this kind of conviction that is all too often lacking Disch believes – even in the city of Freiburg. He's a bit like a teacher who isn't satisfied when his student gets a B because he didn't do everything in his power to get top marks. ""The environmental protection office really does mean well"" Disch says. ""But you don't get the feeling it's doing everything it could. Even here in Vauban it was more a case of the people carrying the city along with them.""

Germany still investing in climate-hostile technologies

Freiburg may be an exemplary student when it comes to climate protection but in Disch's view there's still a lot more it could do. The architect stresses that construction and housing should be a main focus as this sector accounts for 40% of total energy consumption. If Rolf Disch could give Robert Habeck one piece of advice he would tell him to be even more radical in pushing ahead with the energy transition – and to cut ties with industries that stand for the past rather than the future.

""In Wismar the federal government wants to spend €600 million on saving a shipyard from insolvency so it can build cruise ships. This is nonsense!"" Disch declares. ""Once one of those things gets underway it requires vast amounts of energy. We urgently need that workforce to build solar and wind energy plants and renovate houses instead.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhbG9hbHRvb25saW5lLmNvbS9ibG9ncy8yMDIyLzAxLzE2L3RoZS1lY29ub21pY3Mtb2YtcmVzaWRlbnRpYWwtcm9vZnRvcC1zb2xhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Economics of Residential Rooftop Solar,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

The other day I mentioned to someone that I’m not a big fan of residential rooftop solar. His response was “You don’t believe in climate change?” That was my first clue as to how divisive the issue of rooftop solar pricing has become. (1)

There is little disagreement that rooftop solar pricing in California is broken. Solar customers do not pay enough and non-solar customers are left footing the bill. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) looked into fixing this back in 2016 but they were lobbied hard by the solar industry and a split 3-2 decision left the revised rate structure (NEM 2.0) largely intact while the CPUC promised to gather more data.

Well more data has been gathered and it doesn’t look good. The CPUC reports that PG&E’s NEM 2.0 customers pay just 18% of their total annual cost of service while SCE and SDG&E customers pay only 9% (Table 1-7). They conclude that existing NEM 2.0 installations will increase bills paid by non-solar customers by $13 billion over 20 years (Table 5-1).

Analysts at energy consultant E3 looked at the “first-year cost shift” which measures the amount of utility costs that are shifted from solar customers to non-solar in the first year after a system is connected. Their analysis showed that to be $1817 for PG&E $1287 for SCE and $2448 for SDG&E (Table 16). To make matters worse because solar customers tend to be well off this represents a cost-shift from the wealthy to the less wealthy. The CPUC reports that “the costs of NEM are disproportionately paid by younger less wealthy and more disadvantaged ratepayers many of whom are renters.”

Yet another way to look at market distortions is with three other metrics that reflect how much solar customers non-solar customers and the system as a whole benefit: (2)

– PCT = Participant’s benefit-cost ratio (Participant Cost Test)

– RIM = Non-participant’s benefit-cost ratio (Ratepayer Impact Measure)

– TRC = Full system’s benefit-cost ratio (Total Resource Cost)



NEM 2.0 metrics for residential rooftop solar for PG&E non-CARE rates. Source: E3 analysis Table 4 (2021)

The first two columns show that those with solar do very well while those without pay more than their share. The third column indicates that residential rooftop solar overall is not cost-effective costing more than the value it provides to our grid. (3)

When solar is coupled with storage the benefit is greater because it can provide more valuable energy (e.g. between 4-9pm). These paired systems have a TRC value of 0.5 to 0.69 compared to 0.36 without storage. Because the value of these systems is expected to improve as storage prices come down the CPUC is much more interested in promoting solar+storage than standalone solar.

From what I can tell there seems to be little dispute about this analysis and its general conclusions. The disagreement is more about how to fix it. (4)

Why is the issue of solar pricing so contentious and difficult? One reason is that solar customers enjoy their cheap electricity and would like to keep it. That makes sense. In addition the solar industry wants the utilities to maintain low rates so demand for their business stays high. In fact state law requires that pricing ensures that “customer-sited renewable distributed generation continues to grow sustainably”. On the other hand economists rate-payer advocates and the government want to see fair and cost-effective rates; in fact that is part of the CPUC charter. The priorities are inherently conflicting. The unhappy act of balancing these competing interests falls to the CPUC which in 2020 began a lengthy process that resulted in its recently-announced proposed decision. I will go over that decision briefly then share a few thoughts about what else may be behind the uproar over solar rates.

After the CPUC shared and reviewed the analysis summarized above they asked interested parties to propose their own rate structures using a framework provided by energy consultant E3. The CPUC encouraged plans that would align prices with costs and be fair for all customers that would encourage electrification and that would allow the industry to “grow sustainably” especially in disadvantaged communities.

Nearly a dozen organizations developed fairly complete plans and many others provided partial feedback. E3 analyzed the submissions in a June report. The proposals fell largely into two camps with the solar industry in one and rate-payer advocates and investor-owned utilities in the other. Two environmental groups were split with the Sierra Club largely aligning with the solar industry and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) aligning with the rate-payer advocates and utilities.

Some of the questions that the plans needed to address were:

– How should solar customers be credited for energy they export to the grid?

– What should solar customers pay for electricity they import from the grid?

– How should solar customers pay for fixed costs (e.g. transmission and distribution) if they are using little net electricity? (5)

– How many years should it take to pay back a solar installation?

– How should we address the issue of equity?

– How should we transition to the new rate structure?

– Should any of this be retroactive to existing customers?

There was good agreement on some elements but wide disparities on others.

How should solar customers be credited for energy they export to the grid?

A big part of the problem with the NEM 2.0 rates is that solar customers are credited for energy they export to the grid using full retail rates which are much higher than the cost the utility would otherwise incur for that energy at that time. Virtually all proposals suggested they be credited instead at “avoided cost” to better align costs and benefits and create a more accurate price signal. (6) This is where the CPUC landed with its proposal.

What should solar customers pay for electricity they import from the grid?

There was also good agreement on import rates namely that solar customers should pay highly differentiated time-of-use rates again to better align costs with benefits. The investor-owned utilities already offer such rates to some degree though new rates could qualify as well. The CPUC agreed that requiring solar customers to be on these rates is the right approach and cites PG&E’s EV2-A SCE’s TOU-D-PRIME and SDG&E’s EV-TOU-5 as eligible rates.

How should solar customers pay for fixed costs (e.g. transmission and distribution) if they are using little net electricity?

In California many fixed costs are incorporated into the per-kWh electric rates. If you aren’t using much electricity you don’t pay much. Can these costs be better allocated to solar customers whose systems rely on the grid and who often consume at peak times? There was a wide disparity of opinion on this. The investor-owned utilities argued for a substantial charge on solar bills to more appropriately allocate costs and avoid the cost-shift to non-solar customers citing expenses like transmission and distribution wildfire hardening public purpose programs (e.g. CARE) and nuclear decommissioning. In contrast the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) claimed that this type of fee is neither just nor reasonable and in fact is illegal.

For those supporting the charge proposals ranged from $6/kW to $14/kW. The CPUC landed on a monthly “Grid Participation Charge” of $8/kW but with no charge for low-income households. This charge would replace the existing “nonbypassable charge” billed to solar customers and eliminate the $10 minimum bill. CALSSA calls this proposal “draconian” and the Grid Participation Charge remains a major point of contention.

How many years should it take to pay back a solar installation?

The chart below shows the variation in “payback period” in the proposals with the solar industry proposing much shorter payback times than the ratepayer advocates and utilities. All are longer than the current NEM 2.0 payback period of 4.5 years shown in light blue at the bottom.



Payback periods advocated in proposals to CPUC. Source: E3 analysis Figure 1 (2021)

The CPUC explained that it wasn’t interested in targeting a payback period for solar-only projects because these systems are not cost-effective for the grid. For a combined solar+storage system which provides more benefit they set their rates to target a payback period of 10 years. The solar-only payback in the CPUC proposal ends up being about 13 years for PG&E and SCE customers and 7.4 years for SDG&E.

How should we address the issue of equity?

Solar providers argued that the best way to improve equity is to create more incentives to deploy solar for low-income households while utilities said the best way is to lower rates for low-income households by addressing the cost shift. The CPUC opts to do both adding some modifications to the rate structure to make solar systems more affordable for low-income households and setting up an Equity Fund to help pay for them. (7)

How should we transition to the new rate structure?

The solar industry suggested phasing in the new export compensation over time while the utilities dismissed such a proposal as “a request to perpetuate the inequity caused by the current net energy metering program”. The CPUC concluded that “the magnitude and severity of the cost shift requires immediate action by the Commission” deciding against gradually phasing in the new rates and opting instead to ease the transition with a small “Market Transition Credit” on the bill for a period of ten years as shown below. This amount is only available to those who adopt the rate in the first year. After that it drops by 25% each year for new customers before phasing out entirely after four years.



CPUC’s proposed Market Transition Credit. Source: CPUC Proposed Decision (2021)

Should any of this be retroactive to existing customers?

This may be the most contentious element of the CPUC’s proposal. Solar companies warned that changing compensation for any existing customers would be “profoundly destabilizing” and “illegal”. But the ratepayer advocates and utilities felt it important to do more than just stop the bleeding which is all that happens if the rate change is not retroactive. The CPUC agreed. As they put it: “The changes we have made thus far in this decision do nothing to tackle this existing cost shift. The changes only attempt to prevent or at least limit additional cost shift from new customers.”

The more aggressive advocates for rate reform suggested that existing customers should be switched to the new pricing 8 years after their system was installed reasoning that was ample time to pay back their system after which they would continue to receive bill savings albeit at the reduced new rate. The CPUC was more conservative opting to give solar customers a full 15 years on their existing rate before requiring them to switch over.

That is pretty much the gist of the proposal. You can see in the table below that the cost shift is greatly reduced in the CPUC’s proposal though still not zero. You can also see that the plan encourages storage (the PCT metric shows it is a better deal for participants) which is much better for the grid (see TRC column). (8)



Comparison of NEM 2.0 with the CPUC proposal for an installation in PG&E territory non-CARE rates. Source: E3 analysis Tables 16 and 17 and CPUC Proposed Decision Appendix B Table 2.

The outrage about this proposal surprised me — in many ways it appropriately rights a long-standing wrong — but in retrospect it shouldn’t have. Solar customers have long understood that they are providing good clean energy for California while also enjoying lower rates. They may have leaned into that by buying an EV or electric heater that they can operate at extra low cost. You can see why they would be upset at having their rates changed even after a generous 15-year grace period. The solar industry has grown to support customer demand for these low rates and doesn’t want the rug pulled out from under it. The CPUC’s 2016 decision to leave a misguided policy on the books just left more people to get more invested in it.

To compound the problem there is not much of a lobby for non-solar customers. People don’t generally trust the big investor-owned utilities who are among those spearheading this effort. Organizations like the Public Advocate’s Office and the The Utility Reform Network are doing their part along with the Natural Resources Defense Council and a raft of economists. But they can easily be drowned out. This leaves the CPUC facing an uphill battle.

I’ve been trying to find the strongest policy arguments against the CPUC decision arguments based not on personal interest but on the public interest. In the most widely-circulated arguments I’m seeing more emotion than fact with misleading claims few studies cited and fewer proposals to rectify the problems they do see (e.g. distributed storage costs are still too high). Even Stanford Professor Mark Jacobson’s opinion piece in The Hill seemed mostly devoid of economics. (9) Instead it’s largely about the need to electrify.

I haven’t seen this argument spelled out but I think one concern about raising rates for solar customers is that it is easier to electrify when electricity rates are low and California’s prices are anything but. The brightest spot for electrification is in solar homes where rates are heavily subsidized. If we take that away and instead just lower everyone’s rates slightly the fear may be that the easiest case for electrification will disappear and we will lose our momentum.

I’m not convinced. Lower electricity rates certainly help to encourage electrification. But if that is the justification for the heavily subsidized solar pricing then we should be more transparent about it and the rate structure should be tied much more closely to electrification than to solar. Moreover there may be options for more widespread and equitable electrification. For example the state could assume and then recoup in taxes more of the fixed costs of the grid ideally assessing these more progressively than the utilities can easily do. Electricity rates would decrease significantly and be more equitable while electrification would be accessible to many more people. UC Berkeley economist Severin Borenstein has been championing this for some time. I wonder if the state will have to do something like that anyway for our gas infrastructure as homes electrify and fewer households are left paying for it.

Final comments on the CPUC’s proposal are coming in and the final decision should be announced some time this month or next.

In the meantime my advice for households concerned about climate change is to prioritize reducing your fossil usage over switching to rooftop solar. You can still save money while making a much bigger impact. Switch your car to an EV. Fly less. Get a smart thermostat that can save 10% or more on your gas bills. Try a heat-pump water heater and/or a mini-split to see your gas usage plummet.

If you also have or want to get a solar roof fine but consider adding storage. Evening electricity is the critical (and much more expensive) resource and storage enables you to have power when you need it. A home battery also provides resiliency. It is very expensive so not accessible to everyone. But it is far better for the grid than a solar roof on its own.

Palo Alto switched years ago to using “avoided cost” for solar exports. Residents who want solar roofs can still get them but not at the expense of those who cannot or will not. The policy went into effect in January 2018 and adoption stayed strong for the first two years of the revised rate. It leveled off in 2020 and 2021 though it is difficult to tell how much of that was due to COVID delays or the city’s widely publicized permitting difficulties.

Recently my neighbors in Palo Alto were discussing solar roofs on our neighborhood email list. One neighbor was expressing doubt that they paid off having found that the marketed payback periods were overly optimistic. Another replied: “In truth I believe if you are doing this to either be (1) “green” or (2) “save money” it’s probably not worth it. Palo Alto power is already 100% renewable and we have the longish payback time. I’m not sure I believe it really makes any economic sense and power failure avoidance is still probably a once in every “n” year thing. So instead the rock solid reason for doing solar comes down to: (3) want to.”

And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that when you are the only one paying for that decision.

This is their most recent blog post on this topic which has many other links to their other posts. In addition this post from NRDC and this post from the Energy Institute address many of the most common complaints about the CPUC proposal.

1. This blog post is exclusively about residential rooftop solar. The analysis for commercial rooftop as well as community solar is different.

4. The analysis was reviewed in depth as part of the CPUC proceedings and the avoided cost calculation undergoes annual review. There are still some lingering discussions about avoided costs — there always are — but that is generally not the focus of the debate.

5. Many of the largely fixed costs in California’s electricity grid are included in the volumetric (per-kWh) rates. This is partly what makes our rates so high as I wrote about here. These costs include transmission and distribution hardening against wildfires public purpose programs (e.g. CARE) energy efficiency programs and more. Currently solar customers pay a “nonbypassable charge” on each kWh they import in a given metered interval from the grid that covers some of this: the public purpose program charge nuclear decommissioning charge competition transition charge and Department of Water Resources bond charge. The restrictions to metered intervals and imports-only constrain the amount collected as does the limited set of programs covered.

6. Those of you who are Palo Alto residents may know that the City of Palo Alto Utilities already credits solar exports at avoided cost having approved the change in 2016 and rolled it out in January 2018. The initial rate was $0.075/kWh though it has been increased over time to $0.1078/kWh largely because of increases in the cost of transmission and distribution.

7. More detail about this can be found in Section 8.6.1 of the CPUC’s Proposed Decision.

8. It may even be that storage on its own without rooftop solar could be a better value for the grid than solar + storage but E3 did not analyze that option.

9. At the end Professor Jacobson pushes back against the per-kWh aspect of the Grid Participation Charge saying that those who use the grid the least (larger installations) pay the most. It’s not clear to me that they use the grid the least (they may just have bigger houses). I am also strongly in favor of the wealthy paying a greater share of the fixed costs for our grid and this is a baby step in that direction.

10. It seems like residential rooftop solar would provide considerable value when it comes to reducing transmission or distribution costs. But studies show that is true only in certain places. If we were to distribute residential solar optimally it could save money but that is not what we do. You can find discussions about this here and here and here.

Special to Fort Myers News-Press

BABCOCK RANCH – Kitson & Partners announced that Babcock Ranch America’s first solar-powered town has been recognized as the No. 14 top-selling master-planned community of 2021 by RCLCO Real Estate Advisors.

The recognition reflects the record sales of more than 1758 homes with 714 homes sold in 2021.

Encompassing 18000 acres with 19500 planned residences and 6000000 square feet of commercial space Babcock Ranch achieved several additional milestones in 2021 including being named for the second consecutive year as Master Planned Community of the Year by the Lee Building Industry Association.

“Babcock Ranch continues to fulfill our vision of a vibrant new hometown that’s full of possibility” said Syd Kitson Chairman and CEO of Kitson & Partners. “Whether you’re raising a family or enjoying an active retirement you’ll find homes for every lifestyle along with everything you need to stay healthy active and connected.”

As the demand for residential homes in master-planned communities remains high in Babcock Ranch construction activity continues to accelerate where new homes neighborhoods amenities and facilities usher in the next phase of the town’s development.

Last fall Babcock Ranch welcomed the new Crescent B Commons the 82640-square-foot Publix-anchored shopping center located at a new entrance to the community.

Additional developments throughout the community include the construction of the highly anticipated Babcock High School a new state-of-the-art project-based learning destination at Babcock Ranch. A new one-story field house under construction on the school campus will serve as both an emergency shelter and a recreation center for school and community activities. Construction remains on schedule with plans to open in time for the 2022-23 school year.

“As Babcock Ranch continues to grow we are excited to offer our residents and neighbors in the area a broad spectrum of services – from education and recreation spaces to additional options for shopping and dining” added Kitson.

Created by Kitson & Partners with respect for the natural environment and the philosophy that smart growth and sustainability work hand in hand half of the town’s footprint is set aside as greenways parks and expansive lakes providing recreation and scenic backdrops for Babcock Ranch’s homes and the Founder’s Square downtown district.

Babcock Ranch offers homes from seven homebuilders in seven neighborhoods with additional builders and newly introduced neighborhoods coming soon. Homebuilders offer more than 50 home designs ranging from 1120 to more than 4000 square feet. Homes appeal to young millennials families empty nesters and retirees alike with prices ranging from the $200000s to over $1.5 million. Built to Florida Green Building Coalition standards homes emphasize energy and water conservation and offer a full gig of fiber-optic connectivity.

Within Babcock Ranch’s welcoming neighborhoods more than two dozen model and quick-delivery homes are now open or under construction by AR Homes by Arthur Rutenberg Divco Custom Homes Florida Lifestyle Homes Lennar Meritage Homes Pulte Homes and WCI.

Decades after his death his messages of equality love and peace continue to champion a brighter society.

Among those inspired by his legacy is Alfred Leak a line worker at the Illuminating Company in Cleveland Ohio.

As a third-generation ordained minister with distant connections to the legendary activist Leak has always felt that he and Dr. King are kindred spirits.

“Dr. King and I are both proud products of faith and Historically Black Colleges” Leak said. “I identify with him in a number of ways.”

Leak has performed reenactments of Dr. King’s legendary speeches to countless audiences for 25 years including a performance of Dr. King’s “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” speech at the Illuminating Company’s third annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day Celebration last year.

“I’m flattered to be compared to him but there is only one true Dr. King” Leak said. “I believe the similarities people observe in our speeches is a result of our shared values and upbringing.”

A Long History of Honoring Dr. King

His tradition of performing Dr. King’s historical speeches began when he was still in college and his mother pushed him to seek volunteering opportunities. Soon after he received a well-timed note with a request to read an excerpt from one of Dr. King’s famous speeches at his church. His performance was well received and opened a floodgate of requests for more.

“After a while I read Dr. King’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech so many times I could recite it from memory and write it with grammatic perfection from the first word to the last” Leak said.

Eventually Leak began performing other speeches from the legendary civil rights leader. He has since lent his voice to the City of Cleveland the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and a variety of other community organizations in many states.

Coronavirus Pandemic and Social Justice Key Themes for MLK Day 2022

With the ongoing pandemic and social justice issues plaguing our country Leak decided to recite an excerpt from Dr. King’s 1961 Lincoln University “The American Dream” commencement address in honor of this year’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In this address Dr. King argued that the world is a neighborhood where individual decisions affect the larger community and that “as long as diseases are rampant...no man can be totally healthy even if he just got a clean bill of health from the finest clinic in America.”

A video of Leak performing an excerpt from this speech can be seen below.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Leak hopes his talents will help to further Dr. King’s mission of empowering the community and promote the civil rights values he is known for.

“America is a dream and there is still much work to be done to bring that dream to fruition” Leak said.

The historic Milwaukee district was listed at No. 49 on the Times' list which highlighted places around the world.

""I describe it as Milwaukee’s African-American cultural and entertainment district connected through vibrant neighborhoods but also with some of the greatest small businesses predominately owned by African-Americans"" said Coggs.

From the early to mid-1990s Bronzeville was a Black cultural and economic hub. The list said today Bronzeville is ""distinguishing itself as a center for African-American culture.""

""It definitely is a place not only for tourists but people from here who may not have realized just the jewel we have come and see it"" Coggs said.

Businesses like Gee's Clippers help the neighborhood reach recognition. Albert Moore and others who live and shop in Bronzeville said there is more to come.

""I can see things starting to grow around here. Small businesses starting to open up and people moving in trying to catch the wave from Fiserv Forum right down the street"" said Moore.

M-Sport Ford World Rally Team driver line-up for Monte Carlo Rally includes Craig Breen Adrien Fourmaux Gus Greensmith and return of rally legend Sébastien Loeb

FIA World Rally Championship enters an exciting new era at Monte Carlo as hybrid powertrains take to the stage for the first time

The M-Sport Ford World Rally Team (WRT) today gave motorsport fans their first look at the exciting competition livery that will help the new M‑Sport Ford Puma Hybrid Rally1 car electrify the 2022 FIA World Rally Championship (WRC).

The M‑Sport Ford Puma Hybrid Rally1 makes its competitive debut at the Monte Carlo Rally January 20-23. Three cars will be campaigned throughout the 2022 WRC season by drivers Craig Breen Adrien Fourmaux and Gus Greensmith. In addition nine-time FIA World Rally Champion Sébastien Loeb will join the M‑Sport Ford World Rally Team to compete at this year’s Monte Carlo Rally an event he has won seven times previously.

The 2022 WRC season marks the 25th anniversary of a hugely successful partnership between Ford and M-Sport that has delivered seven championships and more than 1500 stage wins in iconic rally cars including the M-Sport Ford Fiesta WRC and the Ford Focus RS WRC. Since the partnership began M-Sport and Ford have delivered a record-breaking 268 consecutive manufacturer points scoring results.

M-Sport Ford World Rally Team Monte Carlo Rally line-up:

Driver Co-driver Driver WRC career highlights Craig Breen Paul Nagle First rally: 2009 Rally de Portugal 22 stage wins 69 rallies 288 points Adrien Fourmaux Alex Coria First rally: 2019 Monte Carlo Rally 1 stage win 26 rallies 45 points Gus Greensmith Jonas Andersson First rally: 2014 Wales Rally GB 58 rallies 91 points Sébastien Loeb Isabelle Galmiche First rally: 1999 Rally Catalunya 9 championships 925 stage wins 180 rallies 1727 points

“One of the most captivating aspects of WRC down the years has been the clear link between the ultra-high performance rally cars and their road-going equivalents"" said Mark Rushbrook global director Ford Performance. ""That's why it's so important that this new era of WRC reflects our industry's shift to electrification. At Ford we're fully committed to an electrified future and campaigning the M-Sport Ford Puma Hybrid Rally1 car in the toughest conditions is going to help us develop even more exciting electrified powertrains for our customers.”

Powered using similar principles to the Puma EcoBoost Hybrid road car on which it is based 1 the new M‑Sport Ford Puma Hybrid Rally1 is Ford's first electrified competition car. A next-generation hybrid powertrain captures energy during braking and coasting and stores it in a 3.9 kWh battery. The energy is then used to supplement the championship-winning performance of the turbocharged 1.6-litre EcoBoost petrol engine with repeated boosts of up to three seconds from a 100 kW electric motor.

The car can also use its electrified powertrain to travel through towns cities service parks and chosen sections between stages using pure-electric power. The battery pack can be recharged using an external power source at the dedicated service points between stages with a recharge taking approximately 25 minutes.

In addition FIA WRC Rally1 competitors will use a fossil-free fuel from the 2022 season blending synthetic and bio-degradable elements to produce a fuel that is 100 per cent sustainable.

“It has been a very busy time getting the cars and team ready for next weekend’s Monte Carlo Rally and the opening of the 2022 World Rally Championship season but one that will be worth the effort” said Richard Millener M-Sport Team principal. “With the help and support of Ford colleagues all over the globe we have produced a fantastic car with huge potential and we cannot wait to showcase it during the year. A big thank you to everyone involved with getting to this stage and helping us meet such tight deadlines and we feel very proud to represent Ford on the world stage in our 25th year of partnership!”

The M‑Sport Ford Puma Hybrid Rally1 car reflects Ford’s commitment to going all-in on electrification. The company last year announced that 100 per cent of its passenger vehicle range in Europe will be zero-emissions capable all-electric or plug-in hybrid by mid-2026; moving to all-electric by 2030.

FTNT,Fortinet,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcGdhLm9yZy5hdS9uZXdzL2luc2lkZS1mb3J0aW5ldHMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLWdvbGYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Fortinet's partnership with Australian golf,"Whether as an individual seeking to secure your rapidly growing digital footprint or a large corporation with millions of dollars of assets that need protecting knowing your cybersecurity needs is paramount. There is no one-size-fits-all solution and you need to develop a cybersecurity posture that directly aligns with your personal or organisational risk profile and appetite.

Consider this: would you rather play a round of golf with a set made to your exact specifications or borrow a half-set from a mate and hope for the best? That’s the difference between a cybersecurity platform that’s been designed for your unique requirements and a basic solution that protects against some but not all of the threats you face.

Knowing the difference is crucial. Working with a partner that can provide advice and recommendations without simply trying to sell you a product or service is essential. That’s where Fortinet comes in.

Dale Nachman country manager Australia Fortinet said “Rather than just selling something to someone to solve an immediate problem we consult and have discussions about where risk may occur and the important information that needs to be protected.

“It’s easy to spend a lot of money and secure everything but if you only need to secure a certain percentage then why spend the extra money? At Fortinet we focus on protecting the things that need to be protected based on your risk appetite and budget.”

Fortinet is a global cybersecurity organisation with more than 7000 staff worldwide and a growing interest in golf.

The company is now the title sponsor of the Fortinet Championship on the PGA TOUR and has entered into a multi-year agreement to be a premier partner of the ISPS Handa PGA Tour of Australasia.

That includes naming rights sponsorship of this week’s Fortinet Australian PGA Championship and Fortinet Australian WPGA Championship where Fortinet hopes to highlight the importance of cybersecurity to Australian golf fans.

Dale Nachman said “Golf is one of those activities that was wide-reaching and gives us an opportunity to reach an audience of people that we felt were our customers and our partners. When the sponsorship opportunity arose participating was a very logical conclusion for the business because it was an extension of some of the things that Fortinet was already doing.”

If golf has enjoyed a boom during the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic so too has the proliferation of cyberthreats.

As more people work from home the digital footprints we create in our personal and business lives are becoming more intertwined opening the door to cybercriminals scouring the internet for gaps that they can exploit.

Dale Nachman said “Everyone’s personal brand is out there. Whether it’s in a corporate environment or in a personal environment the minute information or access is worth something to somebody it becomes a risk. We are seeing a lot more of that.”

This is why so much of Fortinet’s focus during the past two years has been centred on education.

Although Fortinet’s security fabric is used by organisations from small businesses to global financial institutions worth billions of dollars to identify and mitigate potential cyberthreats; the human element remains any data centre’s weakest point.

To overcome the challenge of the human element Fortinet made its education programs free of charge an initiative that continues to this day with up to a million users per month. These training programs fast-track the cyberawareness of users who have never spent more time online and thus have never been more at risk. This increased awareness can help reduce the chances of a successful cyberattack.

To draw another parallel with the game of golf you will get the most out of those clubs fit to your specifications if you spend time with a PGA professional showing you how to maximise their performance.

Stephen Saad head of sales Australia Fortinet said “That’s just Fortinet trying to be a good corporate citizen and understanding that the more we can educate and influence people around being cyberaware that’s half the battle. Then we have the technology to support that cyberawareness.”

Tap into the soundtrack of his record-breaking final round of the 2021 Fortinet Australian PGA Championship at Royal Queensland Golf Club and you’d be all but convinced.

He may not have reached the 25-under target that he and coach Grant Field discussed on Sunday morning but Morgan did what he vowed when he led by nine through three rounds; he won going away.

His final round of two-under 69 and 11-stroke winning margin set a new mark in dominance in one of Australia’s most treasured and time-honoured championships.

Greg Norman (1984 and 1985) and Hale Irwin (1978) owned the prior record of eight-shot winning margins but they must now bow down to a 22-year-old who harnessed the energy of his home-club crowd and took it up a notch.

“Let’s go!” he roared when he made birdie from the sand at the par-5 ninth.

“Yeah!” after holing a 20-footer to save par following a drop from the penalty area at 15.

“Yeah baby!” when his tee shot into the penultimate hole the party hole 17th no less looked online all the way.

There were fist pumps and finger raises and while we didn’t get a Lleyton-like “Come on!” we did see a rewriting of history and the birth of a new star in Australian golf.

The records that fell by the wayside as Morgan collected the Joe Kirkwood Cup were many and varied:

11-stroke winning margin: Greatest in Australian PGA Championship history previously eight strokes held by Greg Norman (1984 and 1985) and Hale Irwin (1978)

22-under par total: Equal lowest score in relation to par in championship history (joining Nick O’Hern and Peter Lonard in 2006)

262 four-round total: Lowest in championship history (previous record 266 set by Nick O’Hern and Peter Lonard in 2006)

22 years one month 18 days: Youngest winner in history of Australian PGA stroke play championship (previous record held by David Howell at 23 years and five months in 1998).

Youngest winner in championship history since Alan Murray in 1961 (21 years 5 months 17 days)

Playing in just his fourth event since turning professional in October Morgan is now all but assured of a DP World Tour card at year’s end his PGA triumph alone bringing with it three DP World Tour starts in July and August this year.

There’s the cheque for $180000 that alleviates any of the initial financial pressures that come as young players find their way but the reality is that at the start of the week Morgan just wanted to play all four days.

“I wanted to just make the cut this week” he admitted. “I know that’s a low kind of shot to shoot at but it was all reality.

“I felt a lot of pressure especially on myself obviously being a member here and having won the (2020) Australian Amateur here and stuff.

“I missed a couple of Tour Schools in the US towards the end of my trip and come back a little bit with my tail between my legs.

“I’d never imagine this happening to be honest with you.”

Encouraged by his coach to stay true to his personality and express whatever emotions he was feeling the confident let’s-get-some attitude belied a swirling mix of nervous energy bubbling beneath the surface.

“I’ve been feeling sick for like three days especially after I was leading after two rounds” said Morgan who shot to the lead on day two with a course record eight-under 63 and was never headed.

“I thought There’s no way back from there. I tried to press as hard as I could and tried to keep pushing it. It’s been amazing what’s happened.

“I’m glad it’s over. Whether I won or lost I’m just glad it’s over because I’ve been in all sorts for sure.

“I’ve never had that type of emotion. I’ve felt pressure for sure but I’ve never felt pressure like the way I felt it this week. It was something.

“I want to do it again. Obviously there’s a couple of things I’d do a bit different just try not to feel that way but you can’t help most of it.”

Sunday’s final grouping was notable for the fact that the two combatants both hail from the Lockyer Valley an hour west of Brisbane runner-up Andrew Dodt growing up 200 metres from the Gatton Golf Club while 15 minutes down the road Morgan’s parents were running the Hatton Vale golf course and Fairways Tavern.

He plays like a young Greg Norman and fist pumps like little Lleyton but we’ll soon come to understand that there is no one quite like Jed Morgan.

“The best thing I’ve done this week is just be myself for the first time in a long time on the golf course” he admitted.

It was a triumph for two young Australian players the PGA resuming after a year’s hiatus for the pandemic and the WPGA having its noteworthy debut as a tournament.

Morgan 22 equalled the tournament record of 22-under par but broke the championship’s biggest winning margin – previously eight shots held by Hale Irwin and Greg Norman – in beating Andrew Dodt by a remarkable 11.

He is also the youngest winner of the tournament in 60 years putting together rounds of 65-63-65-69 at a course he knows all too well as a five-year club member.

Melburnian Oh 25 won the Australian Ladies Masters on the Gold Coast in 2015 in just her second start as a professional having been an astonishing amateur. But she had not won since that day notwithstanding a few near-misses on the LPGA Tour in the United States where she has played since 2016.

She was the top-ranked player in the women’s field and her play matched her billing adding a 68 today to her earlier 66-72-68 to reach 10 under par overall and rolling in a lovely birdie putt to finish in front of a raucous crowd around the 18th. She beat Sydney professional Grace Kim (6-under) by four shots in the end although Kim did hold the lead at several points of the final round.

Morgan was never threatened starting out with a nine-shot lead over fellow-Queenslander Dodt and soon making birdies at the first and third holes to stretch the buffer to 11 showing that there were no nerves. He made the occasional mistake – pulled tee shots at the par-three eighth and the 11th holes that cost him shots and a flared second shot to the par-five 15th into the water but he was generally able to recover. Notably at 15 he took his penalty drop beside the pond chipped it up and then buried the putt from long range to save par.

The only highlight he could not manage was a birdie to finish; his short iron shot stopped at five metres but his putt fell short. He had to be content with a tap-in for his first pro win and a huge fist pump for the crowd who included friends family and club mates.

With the win he secures three starts on the current DP World Tour and most likely a full card for the 2022-23 season in Europe.

This is because of the recently-announced alignment between Europe and the ISPS Handa PGA Tour of Australasia which means that the top three players on the local order of merit earn European cards.

The $180000 in prizemoney that he picked up almost certainly will not be overtaken in the order or merit making it career-changing for a young man who only turned pro a couple of months ago.

Morgan put the sport on notice when he won the 2020 Men’s Australian Amateur at Royal Queensland. Today he franked that talent level and showed that he has a wonderful future.

Originally from the town of Hatton Vale about an hour west of Brisbane where his grandparents ran a golf facility Morgan has had mentoring from Ricky Ponting the former Test cricket captain and his coach is Grant Field who also instructs Cameron Smith. The latter has been a strong influence upon him as well hosting him as part of the Cameron Smith Scholarship at his home in Jacksonville Florida.

“I don’t know other than thanking everyone who’s come out and supported me and my playing partners over the last few days” he said.

“It’s something else. I was thinking about it on Wednesday and I was like ‘I really hope I make the cut’ because I’d hat to miss the cut at my home track and not put on a good show.

“To have done what I’ve done with my team is so sick.”

Oh was an amateur phenomenon qualifying to play her first Women’s Australian Open at just 12 years old. But her path as a professional hasn’t been so smooth. She has kept a strong perspective saying this week that at 25 her career was young but more was expected of her. She is heading back to the US soon and maybe her time is coming.

The key moments in the women’s tournament both came at the par-four 13th hole. Kim attacked the flag from 80 metres and went fractionally long then her chip back up the slope came back to her leading to a double bogey losing the one-shot lead she held at the time. A few minutes later Oh also missed the 13th green and was left with a tricky putt from a swale. She holed it for birdie throwing back her head in delight at a break taken.

She would not relinquish the lead from there.

Oh wins the inaugural Karrie Webb Cup having been a Webb Scholarship holder in the past.

“I can’t wait to celebrate with her” said Oh. “I can’t wait to see her. It’s such an honour to put my name up here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcGdhLm9yZy5hdS9uZXdzL2tpbS1sb3ZpbmctYmVpbmctaW4tdGhlLWh1bnQtYXQtd3BnYS1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kim loving being in the hunt at WPGA Championship,"Grace Kim is learning every day about her mettle as a rookie pro and quickly burying the hurt of her late Saturday wobbles will be another test at the Fortinet WPGA Championship.

The rookie pro from Sydney’s Avondale Golf Club had played so serenely through the opening 14 holes of the third round that no one saw the turbulence ahead.

She’d stroked in three birdies at Royal Queensland and earned the plaudits of playing partner Andrew Dodt for “hardly missing a shot.”

In a blink the 21-year-old dropped three shots in two holes and a slump in her shoulders made it the first crisis of her biggest tournament as a pro.

A par-par finish still meant signing for an even-par round. Kim (69-68-71) will start Sunday’s final round beside LPGA regular Sarah Jane Smith (71-68-69) on five-under as the pair try to apply the pressure on two-stroke leader Su Oh.

“I obviously didn’t end it the way I wanted but hopefully I’ll have a lot more putts drop in on Sunday. To be able to chase someone is pretty exciting for tomorrow” Kim said.

Kim caught a huge lucky break on the short par four 12th when she miscued her bump-and-run approach which had the steam to scuttle off the green. It ricocheted off Dodt’s ball came to a favourable stop and she holed for a birdie.

Kim came unstuck on the par five 15th when her drive found a fairway bunker and she caught the lip and stayed in with her second shot. By the time she’d pulled her approach left and come up short with a chip she was signing for an ugly seven. Another poor chip cost her bogey on the next before she stabilised a little.

Kim saw beyond the hiccups to the big picture of competing at the top end of a big event with $180000 for the winner on Sunday.

“It’s great. I’m probably the only one who doesn’t really have a full US card in the top half of this field but it’s really comforting to know that I’m able to compete against them” Kim said.

“I’m loving where I am right now.”

Smith made the big early move on Saturday. The 37-year-old Queenslander gave no hint of it with a bogey on her opening hole before back-to-back birdies.

She was four-under for three holes when she played a beautiful 50-degree wedge into the par four fifth from 88m. The ball kept on tracking all the way into the hole for an eagle a huge smile and a jump to six-under.

When she is on that sort of roll of no-fuss swings putts dropping and quick play you do feel the groove she is in.

When she had a two-putt birdie on the part five seventh to reach seven-under you felt the momentum she was riding.

A hiccup for bogey on the 13th and then a costly double bogey on the 16th when she missed a short putt dropped her back.

Curling in a lovely 2.5m putt on the final hole for her fifth birdie was just the tonic.

“It was all over the place. I felt I played really solid and smart in places and then made some really silly mistakes” Smith said.

Smith is just two shots behind Oh and is a realistic chance at winning her first pro event in 14 years.

“I definitely need a low one on Sunday” Smith said.

She’ll switch her mindset to attack more after playing with Brad Kennedy for two rounds.

“I had a good talk to Brad. Something I need to do is be a bit more aggressive on the course. I’ve played really well on really tough golf courses in the past” she said.

“I can make a lot of birdies…Sunday is a good chance to practice that.”

Young Aussies Breanna Gill (68) and Julienne Soo (68) into fourth both jumped up the field with top third round scores."

There are few things that can keep up with playoff football. Every game draws us to the television like a moth to a flame passing the often cold winter nights with hot passion of winner-takes-all moments.

The NFL’s Super Wild Card weekend has arrived. And for sports fans there are few better windows of action than watching six football games spread over roughly 60 hours of real-time.

For many this is also a great weekend to get involved with a little more action on the game itself. That’s where FOX Bet comes in. Whether it is the thrill and excitement of FOX Bet Super 6 for the Eagles-Buccaneers game on Sunday afternoon (1 p.m. EST FOX) or placing a wager on the FOX Bet Sportsbook app in Michigan Pennsylvania New Jersey and Colorado – there are so many ways to maximize the excitement.

Let’s look at the Eagles-Buccaneers game and how you can win in multiple ways.

The matchup

Can Tom Brady do it again? The 44-year-old veteran quarterback with seven rings on his fingers looks for a repeat with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs are the second seed in the NFC Playoffs and will start the tournament at home – under forecasted rainy and windy conditions- against Jalen Hurts and the upstart Philadelphia Eagles.

Brady and the Bucs beat the Eagles in Philadelphia on a Thursday night in October picking on the Philly defense in the first half then withstanding a late charge. However this is a different Eagles team with a running game powered behind one of the best offensive lines in the game with All-Pros Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson. Miles Sanders is the wild card in this playing his first game in nearly a month after breaking his hand.

FOX Bet Super 6

The Eagles-Buccaneers game is the featured attraction in FOX Bet’s Super 6 app for this week. This week there’s $100000 of Terry Bradshaw’s money on the line for anyone who enters for the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 contest (after complaining about being out of money Terry’s friend Howie Long finds an extra suitcase of cash that lifts the jackpot to that lofty number).

To win anyone has to correctly guess the answers to six in-game questions that involve different aspects of the game as well as picking the winner of the game by the correct amount of points.

The best part about FOX Bet Super 6 is that it’s completely free and an awful lot of fun. Just download the app on your phone or tablet device to play this contest or any number of games that are available for free every day. Over $6 million in prize money has been awarded by FOX Bet Super 6 since its debut in 2019.

FOX Bet Sportsbook

The Buccaneers are 8 ½ point favorites over Philadelphia on Sunday. If you placed a $110 bet on the Bucs at that number you would need them to win the game by nine or more points to win $100 profit.

If you think the Eagles are going to win the game outright the better bet could be taking them on the ""money line."" A $100 wager on Philadelphia to win outright on the money line would pay off – as of Friday afternoon-- at +310 in winnings. The Buccaneers are -400 on the money line meaning a $400 bet would be needed to win $100.

The over/under total on the Eagles-Bucs game was 45 ½ points. A bet on the over would need to result in the total score of the game being 46 points or over – something that a shaky weather forecast may not make easy to get.

There are also offers that could sweeten the pot for you if you bet through the FOX Bet Sportsbook – such as a chance to double your money if the Eagles score a rushing touchdown (maximum bet of $10.)

Of course the Eagles-Buccaneers is not the only game going on. All five games on Super Wild Card Weekend-- Raiders-Bengals Patriots-Bills 49ers-Cowboys Steelers-Chiefs and Cardinals-Rams-- are on the board on the FOX Bet Sportsbook app for you to pick and potentially win on. There are Super Boosts and offers that could add a little excitement to your account. Here’s to the Wild in the Wildcard Weekend!

The Golden Arches similar to many restaurants around the country have struggled with consistent employee attendance during the COVID-19 surge brought on by the omicron variant as infections reach record levels. Restaurant industry data shows a dip in sales at the end of December.

Chris Kempczinski McDonald's Corp. CEO who assumed the role back in November 2019 says adjusting during these times is one of many priorities for the company's growth and well-being.

The pandemic hurt McDonald's flourishing breakfast business after a decline in morning commuters. It was able to bounce back after American cities allowed for drive-thru lanes to remain open. The fast-food chain's sales returned to pre-pandemic levels by March 2021.

Over the past two years the company has embraced celebrity partnerships with rappers Travis Scott and Saweetie and Korean pop group BTS. While new menu items from these partnerships only lasted for a limited time the promotions helped to boost sales past pre-pandemic levels.

As far as the safety of employees McDonald's has provided COVID tests McDonald's franchises for employees but has no way to track whether someone has contracted the virus or not. Kempczinki says that should be the responsibility of a healthcare agency.

McDonald's and its franchises employ close to 800000 people in the U.S.

The Supreme Court said no to the mandate earlier this week.

In a time where 2021 was dubbed The Great Resignation due to a record-breaking year for Americans who quit their jobs McDonald's works to pivot and make the necessary adjustments. As of now Chris Kempczinki says he'll continue to plan for the future of the company but doesn't bank on longevity as leader of the company.

""I’d say I’m a little bit more Zen about just everything that goes into the job"" he says.

From hits like Alien (1979) and The Martian (2015) Scott’s latest — The Last Duel (2021) and House of Gucci (2021) — dropped in the latter half of last year.

A vocal and ardent supporter of traditional moviegoing Scott has now spoken about how the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox now 20th Century Studios impacted his relationship with his studio home and the type of project Disney wanted from him.

Over the years Disney has continued to expand its entertainment dominance. Not just the home to family movies and animated classics the House of Mouse in the past two decades has acquired Marvel Studios helmed by Kevin Feige and Lucasfilm — home to Star Wars and the galaxy far far away. Then in 2019 Disney became the owner of 21st Century Fox and thereby the 20th Century Fox film division rebranding the corporation to 20th Century Studios. For movies produced by 20th Century Studios Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributes and markets them.

This brings us back to Sir Ridley Scott who since 1979 has directed 9 feature films for 20th Century Fox. These include Alien Kingdom of Heaven (2005) A Good Year (2006) Prometheus (2012) The Counselor (2013) Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) The Martian (2015) Alien: Covenant (2017) and The Last Duel. The latter saw Star Wars sequel star Adam Driver appear alongside Matt Damon Ben Affleck and Jodie Comer as Jacques Le Gris Sir Jean De Carrouges Pierre d’Alençon and Marguerite de Carrouges respectively.

Ostensibly Scott is hailed as one of the world’s most gifted filmmakers — he has after all scored three Academy Award nominations for Best Director (Thelma and Louise Black Hawk Down and Gladiator with the latter winning for Best Picture) — but has been increasingly vocal over moviegoing habits and the nature of original stories in cinema. Last year the celebrated director blasted superhero movies in a verbal assault on the genre despite Scott having helmed his own version of “superhero” films such as Alien and Blade Runner (1982) which starred Sigourney Weaver (Ellen Ripley) and Harrison Ford (Rick Deckard) respectively in defining roles.

Scott once again lashed out at the significantly poor box office performance of The Last Duel slamming “Millenials” as the reason for the movie’s theatrical release failure. Now the House of Gucci — which itself boasted a stellar cast including Lady Gaga (Patrizia Reggiani) and Adam Driver (Maurizio Gucci) — director has commented on the Disney-Fox merger and just why he didn’t direct what the Mouse House wanted when it happened.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter Scott had this to say on the types of projects he chooses:

When it comes to choosing projects Scott says “I feel like I’m a child in a playpen with lots of toys and I’ll go ‘Oh that looks nice and red and shiny. I’ll go for that.’”

He adds:

“The older I get the more I look for things which are about something aren’t just entertainment […] It must have an effect on somebody.”

The Hollywood Reporter goes on to state what Disney had hopefully wanted Scott to board with:

When Disney bought Fox for years his home studio he says “They wanted me to do a wizard film and I don’t do wizard films. It wasn’t a good idea.”

There were rumors back in 2018 that Scott was possibly attached to a Merlin movie based on the “Merlin Saga” novels by TA Barron. As Gizmodo reported:

Variety reports that [Ridley] Scott is in talks to direct Merlin Saga based on the novels by T.A. Barron. The film tells the origin of the legendary wizard who would go on to advise King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable.

The Merlin Saga movie is most likely what Scott is referencing here when he talks about “wizard films”. It seems unlikely that the director will ever direct anything for Disney directly but stranger things have happened in Hollywood.

Next up for Scott will be Kitbag for Apple TV+ which stars Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon Bonaparte and Vanessa Kirby as Empress Josephine. Kirby took over the role after Jodie Comer exited the project due to scheduling issues.

The website has temporarily suspended his account over COVID-19 misinformation specifically for saying masks are useless in preventing the coronavirus' spread. YouTube updated its rules in 2020 to prohibit ""content about COVID-19 that poses a serious risk of egregious harm."" It doesn't permit videos with medical misinformation that contradicts local health authorities such as the World Health Organization.

The organization considers wearing masks ""a key measure to reduce transmission and save lives."" That's why YouTube explicitly states that videos containing claims that wearing masks have negative side effects and that they don't play a role in preventing the contraction or transmission of COVID-19 go against its policy. The website has suspended several creators for COVID-19 disinformation in the past including Sky News Australia One American News Network and Senator Rand Paul.

Bongino is only getting a week-long suspension because it's his first strike under the policy. If he gets another strike within 90 days he'll get another two-week suspension. His channel will only be removed if he gets a third strike within three months. In addition to suspending his uploads YouTube has also demonetized his channel for ""repeatedly violating [its] Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines on harmful and dangerous acts."" He will however be able to re-apply for the Partner Program after 30 days.

That said it looks like Bongino has plans to keep posting about masks and their supposed failure to prevent the transmission and contraction of the virus. The Bongino Report website's Twitter account posted a copy of his email to YouTube which tells the customer service rep that he will ""immediately post content on why masks have been totally ineffective in stopping this pandemic"" after his suspension is over. He dared YouTube to do something about it. Bongino also called the website (and by extension Google) a ""tyrannical free speech-hating bullshit big tech shithole.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS8zZC1wcmludGVkLTMtYmVkcm9vbS1ob21lLW1hZGUtMTItaG91cnPSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvM2QtcHJpbnRlZC0zLWJlZHJvb20taG9tZS1tYWRlLTEyLWhvdXJzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3D printed 3-bedroom home's exterior was made in 12 hours: Take a look inside,"Habitat for Humanity is using 3D-printing technology to speed up the home-building process for families in need of affordable housing.

Families accepted into the Habitat for Humanity program put in a few hundred hours of sweat equity toward building their home which varies among the organization’s affiliates. When the program’s requirements are fulfilled and construction is completed families in need of affordable housing are connected to lenders able to offer income-based repayment plans.

Current estimates from Freddie Mac suggest the U.S. has a housing supply deficit of 3.8 million homes. The federal home loan corporation blames the nation’s housing deficit in part to a construction slowdown that stems from a skilled labor shortage and rising raw material costs.

The Buccaneers are 8 ½ point favorites over Philadelphia on Sunday. If you placed a $110 bet on the Bucs at that number you would need them to win the game by nine or more points to win $100 profit.

If you think the Eagles are going to win the game outright the better bet could be taking them on the ""money line."" A $100 wager on Philadelphia to win outright on the money line would pay off – as of Friday afternoon-- at +310 in winnings. The Buccaneers are -400 on the money line meaning a $400 bet would be needed to win $100.

The over/under total on the Eagles-Bucs game was 45 ½ points. A bet on the over would need to result in the total score of the game being 46 points or over – something that a shaky weather forecast may not make easy to get.

There are also offers that could sweeten the pot for you if you bet through the FOX Bet Sportsbook – such as a chance to double your money if the Eagles score a rushing touchdown (maximum bet of $10.)

Of course the Eagles-Buccaneers is not the only game going on. All five games on Super Wild Card Weekend-- Raiders-Bengals Patriots-Bills 49ers-Cowboys Steelers-Chiefs and Cardinals-Rams-- are on the board on the FOX Bet Sportsbook app for you to pick and potentially win on. There are Super Boosts and offers that could add a little excitement to your account. Here’s to the Wild in the Wildcard Weekend!

The Golden Arches similar to many restaurants around the country have struggled with consistent employee attendance during the COVID-19 surge brought on by the omicron variant as infections reach record levels. Restaurant industry data shows a dip in sales at the end of December.

Chris Kempczinski McDonald's Corp. CEO who assumed the role back in November 2019 says adjusting during these times is one of many priorities for the company's growth and well-being.

The pandemic hurt McDonald's flourishing breakfast business after a decline in morning commuters. It was able to bounce back after American cities allowed for drive-thru lanes to remain open. The fast-food chain's sales returned to pre-pandemic levels by March 2021.

Over the past two years the company has embraced celebrity partnerships with rappers Travis Scott and Saweetie and Korean pop group BTS. While new menu items from these partnerships only lasted for a limited time the promotions helped to boost sales past pre-pandemic levels.

As far as the safety of employees McDonald's has provided COVID tests McDonald's franchises for employees but has no way to track whether someone has contracted the virus or not. Kempczinki says that should be the responsibility of a healthcare agency.

McDonald's and its franchises employ close to 800000 people in the U.S.

The Supreme Court said no to the mandate earlier this week.

In a time where 2021 was dubbed The Great Resignation due to a record-breaking year for Americans who quit their jobs McDonald's works to pivot and make the necessary adjustments. As of now Chris Kempczinki says he'll continue to plan for the future of the company but doesn't bank on longevity as leader of the company.

""I’d say I’m a little bit more Zen about just everything that goes into the job"" he says.

From hits like Alien (1979) and The Martian (2015) Scott’s latest — The Last Duel (2021) and House of Gucci (2021) — dropped in the latter half of last year.

A vocal and ardent supporter of traditional moviegoing Scott has now spoken about how the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox now 20th Century Studios impacted his relationship with his studio home and the type of project Disney wanted from him.

Over the years Disney has continued to expand its entertainment dominance. Not just the home to family movies and animated classics the House of Mouse in the past two decades has acquired Marvel Studios helmed by Kevin Feige and Lucasfilm — home to Star Wars and the galaxy far far away. Then in 2019 Disney became the owner of 21st Century Fox and thereby the 20th Century Fox film division rebranding the corporation to 20th Century Studios. For movies produced by 20th Century Studios Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributes and markets them.

This brings us back to Sir Ridley Scott who since 1979 has directed 9 feature films for 20th Century Fox. These include Alien Kingdom of Heaven (2005) A Good Year (2006) Prometheus (2012) The Counselor (2013) Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) The Martian (2015) Alien: Covenant (2017) and The Last Duel. The latter saw Star Wars sequel star Adam Driver appear alongside Matt Damon Ben Affleck and Jodie Comer as Jacques Le Gris Sir Jean De Carrouges Pierre d’Alençon and Marguerite de Carrouges respectively.

Ostensibly Scott is hailed as one of the world’s most gifted filmmakers — he has after all scored three Academy Award nominations for Best Director (Thelma and Louise Black Hawk Down and Gladiator with the latter winning for Best Picture) — but has been increasingly vocal over moviegoing habits and the nature of original stories in cinema. Last year the celebrated director blasted superhero movies in a verbal assault on the genre despite Scott having helmed his own version of “superhero” films such as Alien and Blade Runner (1982) which starred Sigourney Weaver (Ellen Ripley) and Harrison Ford (Rick Deckard) respectively in defining roles.

Scott once again lashed out at the significantly poor box office performance of The Last Duel slamming “Millenials” as the reason for the movie’s theatrical release failure. Now the House of Gucci — which itself boasted a stellar cast including Lady Gaga (Patrizia Reggiani) and Adam Driver (Maurizio Gucci) — director has commented on the Disney-Fox merger and just why he didn’t direct what the Mouse House wanted when it happened.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter Scott had this to say on the types of projects he chooses:

When it comes to choosing projects Scott says “I feel like I’m a child in a playpen with lots of toys and I’ll go ‘Oh that looks nice and red and shiny. I’ll go for that.’”

He adds:

“The older I get the more I look for things which are about something aren’t just entertainment […] It must have an effect on somebody.”

The Hollywood Reporter goes on to state what Disney had hopefully wanted Scott to board with:

When Disney bought Fox for years his home studio he says “They wanted me to do a wizard film and I don’t do wizard films. It wasn’t a good idea.”

There were rumors back in 2018 that Scott was possibly attached to a Merlin movie based on the “Merlin Saga” novels by TA Barron. As Gizmodo reported:

Variety reports that [Ridley] Scott is in talks to direct Merlin Saga based on the novels by T.A. Barron. The film tells the origin of the legendary wizard who would go on to advise King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable.

The Merlin Saga movie is most likely what Scott is referencing here when he talks about “wizard films”. It seems unlikely that the director will ever direct anything for Disney directly but stranger things have happened in Hollywood.

Next up for Scott will be Kitbag for Apple TV+ which stars Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon Bonaparte and Vanessa Kirby as Empress Josephine. Kirby took over the role after Jodie Comer exited the project due to scheduling issues.

The website has temporarily suspended his account over COVID-19 misinformation specifically for saying masks are useless in preventing the coronavirus' spread. YouTube updated its rules in 2020 to prohibit ""content about COVID-19 that poses a serious risk of egregious harm."" It doesn't permit videos with medical misinformation that contradicts local health authorities such as the World Health Organization.

The organization considers wearing masks ""a key measure to reduce transmission and save lives."" That's why YouTube explicitly states that videos containing claims that wearing masks have negative side effects and that they don't play a role in preventing the contraction or transmission of COVID-19 go against its policy. The website has suspended several creators for COVID-19 disinformation in the past including Sky News Australia One American News Network and Senator Rand Paul.

Bongino is only getting a week-long suspension because it's his first strike under the policy. If he gets another strike within 90 days he'll get another two-week suspension. His channel will only be removed if he gets a third strike within three months. In addition to suspending his uploads YouTube has also demonetized his channel for ""repeatedly violating [its] Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines on harmful and dangerous acts."" He will however be able to re-apply for the Partner Program after 30 days.

That said it looks like Bongino has plans to keep posting about masks and their supposed failure to prevent the transmission and contraction of the virus. The Bongino Report website's Twitter account posted a copy of his email to YouTube which tells the customer service rep that he will ""immediately post content on why masks have been totally ineffective in stopping this pandemic"" after his suspension is over. He dared YouTube to do something about it. Bongino also called the website (and by extension Google) a ""tyrannical free speech-hating bullshit big tech shithole.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS8zZC1wcmludGVkLTMtYmVkcm9vbS1ob21lLW1hZGUtMTItaG91cnPSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvM2QtcHJpbnRlZC0zLWJlZHJvb20taG9tZS1tYWRlLTEyLWhvdXJzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3D printed 3-bedroom home's exterior was made in 12 hours: Take a look inside,"Habitat for Humanity is using 3D-printing technology to speed up the home-building process for families in need of affordable housing.

The international nonprofit and a list of advanced home construction partners are swiftly printing exterior walls with liquid concrete according to South West News Service (SWNS).

HABITAT FOR HUMANITY STRUGGLES WITH HIGH CONSTRUCTION COSTS

Typically the process would take around four weeks to construct but through 3D printing it was cut down to 12 hours – as seen in the 1200-square-foot home the organization’s Habitat for Humanity Peninsula and Greater Williamsburg affiliate built in Virginia for a mother and son.

Habitat for Humanity’s Peninsula and Greater Williamsburg affiliate partnered with Alquist a 3D-printing home construction company to build the single-story three-bedroom and two-bath house. According to the organization’s website Alquist’s concrete method offers savings up to 15% per square foot compared to preliminary lumber estimates. It’s also said to be resistant to tornado and hurricane damage.

Each Alquist home is built with a proprietary Raspberry Pi-based monitoring system from Virginia Tech which is a university-designed smart home program that manages indoor environments security emergency protocols energy efficiency comfort and space utilization.

More than 2200 miles away from Habitat’s first occupied 3D-printed home is its first-ever created 3D-printing venture in Tempe Arizona.

That 3D-printed home was built by Habitat for Humanity of Central Arizona and Design Candelaria a residential architecture and lifestyle firm. Similar to the Virginia home the organization’s first 3D-printed construction has three bedrooms and two bathrooms but instead it has 1738 square feet of livable space and 70 to 80% of it is 3D-printed including its exterior and interior walls.

""The home in Tempe Arizona broke ground in March 2021"" Habitat told Fox. ""[It’s] expected to close sometime in February 2022.""

MEDIAN HOME PRICES ARE GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE AS THE PANDEMIC WINDS DOWN

Families accepted into the Habitat for Humanity program put in a few hundred hours of sweat equity toward building their home which varies among the organization’s affiliates. When the program’s requirements are fulfilled and construction is completed families in need of affordable housing are connected to lenders able to offer income-based repayment plans.

Current estimates from Freddie Mac suggest the U.S. has a housing supply deficit of 3.8 million homes. The federal home loan corporation blames the nation’s housing deficit in part to a construction slowdown that stems from a skilled labor shortage and rising raw material costs.

""If we can deliver decent affordable more energy-efficient homes at less cost in less time and with less waste we think that could be a real game changer. Think of the implications"" said Jason Barlow Habitat for Humanity of Central Arizona’s president and CEO in a statement.

But in the event of more extreme tsunami events are you at risk?

That's the question the California Geological Survey and California Governor's Office of Emergency Services hope to answer with their ""Tsunami Inundation Maps.""

According to the CGS tsunamis are a series ""of extremely long waves caused by a large and sudden displacement of the ocean (after an earthquake for example)"" which radiate out from the starting point in all directions.

Tsunamis travel faster in deep water and can reach speeds over 500 mph -- faster than a jet plane.

""As they enter shallow water near land they slow to approximately 20 or 30 mph which is still faster than a person can run"" the CGS says. And as they slow down they get taller.

Planning ahead in the case of a tsunami advisory or tsunami warning is important especially for parts of the coastline that are at a higher flood risk.

The interactive maps embedded below allow you to put in your address -- or the address of a place you visit frequently -- and search to see how quickly flooded that area might be in the event of a tsunami.

Residents of Long Beach along Huntington Beach or those further north in Santa Monica may be living in the hazard zone along the coast.

Armed with the knowledge from the maps which were first created in 2009 and were updated in March 2021 CGS and Cal OES hope people can plan a safe evacuation route out of the hazard zone in the event of a tsunami emergency.

The state also has a helpful California Tsunami Preparedness Guide with information on where tsunamis have occurred in the past and what you can do if one heads toward your area.

To ensure you're prepared if a tsunami hits your area here are some of those tips from CGS:

Get your local tsunami evacuation map.

Practice your evacuation route.​

Put together or purchase an emergency “go-bag” containing at least 72 hours of supplies. Here's what the American Red Cross recommends and here's a list from Ready.gov.

Ensure you have multiple ways to receive tsunami warnings. That includes paying attention to your surroundings by looking out for strong earthquakes or sudden rises or falls in the ocean in addition to making sure your phone is set to receive emergency alerts. A battery operated NOAA Weather Radio is also recommended.

This meet served as the unofficial national championships since the Nike Cross Nationals were canceled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Union Catholic an independent school in Scotch Plains came into the race ranked No. 1 in New Jersey and No. 7 in the country. It solidified its place as one the greatest packs in state history by putting three guys at less than 15 minutes including the fastest sophomore time in U.S. history by Wischusen and becoming the fastest team in New Jersey history with a 15:02.72 average in its fourth-place finish with 299 points in the Gold Division race.

Union Catholic’s five-man average of 15:02.72 broke the previous state 5K team record 15:03.78 set by Christian Brothers Academy at the 2013 Shore Conference Cross Country Championships at Ocean County Park.

The lightning-fast course produced many of the fastest times ever run in U.S. history; hundreds of personal records were set. In the Gold Division races 71 boys dipped below the 15-minute mark and 128 girls broke 18 minutes.

The boys Gold race was won by the No. 1 school in the country Newbury Park of California which threw down the fastest race in high school history and swept the top three places with the three fastest high school cross-country times ever run on the way to an average of 14:14.

Newbury’s Colin Sahlman (14:03.29) Leo Young (14:05.07) and Lex Young (14:05.49) as well as fourth-place finisher Zane Bergen of Niwot Colo. who ran 14:09.91 all ran faster than the former all-time fastest time of 14:10.4 set in 2000 by Dathan Ritzenhein of Rockford Mich.

Union Catholic was led by the dynamic duo of Shane Brosnan and Wischusen.

The Harvard-bound Brosnan led the charge for Union Catholic by placing 13th in 14:25.64 the fourth-fastest 5K cross-country time ever run by a New Jersey runner. Brosnan concluded his season on Saturday Dec. 11 when he finished seventh at the EastBay National Championships in San Diego.

Wischusen according to the MileSplit database became the fastest sophomore in U.S. history by placing 16th in 14:33.94 the fifth fastest New Jersey time ever.

The only New Jersey runners ever to go faster in a 5K cross-country race than Brosnan and Wischusen are the legendary Edward Cheserek of St. Benedict’s Prep and Jackson Barna of Ridge. Cheserek widely considered the best high school distance runner in U.S. history owns the state’s two fastest cross-country 5K times — 14:18.7 in 2012 and 14:20 in 2011 both at the Essex County XC Championship Meet at Brookdale Park in Bloomfield. Barna became the third-fastest New Jersey runner ever on Saturday Dec. 4 when he placed eighth in 14:22.14.

All seven of Union Catholic’s runners ran huge personal-best times.

After Brosnan and Wischusen Union Catholic’s scorers were senior Myles Plummer 68th in 14:59.65; junior Caudell Cajuste 196th in 15:37.26; and junior Ryan Cichocki 198th in 15:37.26. Freshman Evan Weber (16:24.82) and sophomore Josh Hunsinger (17:23.84) were the No. 6 and No. 7 runners for Union Catholic.

In the girls competition for Union Catholic Gunsiorowski a junior who played soccer until this season concluded her remarkable rookie season on the trails by placing 19th in the Silver Division race in 18:13.42 to break the school record of 18:17 set in 2018 by Jerika Lufrano. In the Bronze Division race Holy Cross–bound Abby Granrath ran a season-best 19:40.74 to finish 47th.

The performance by the Union Catholic boys on Saturday Dec. 4 is the final jewel for the Vikings in a season filled with crowning achievements. In addition to their state record 15:02 average the Vikings won their first Meet of Champions title with an average of 16:01 No. 2 in Holmdel Park history; captured the Non-Public A title for the first time; repeated as Union County champions with a Warinanco Park course record average of 16:03; and ran a course-record average of 15:49 at Oak Ridge Park.

Considering that only one New Jersey cross-country team has ever won a national title — CBA in 2011 at Portland Meadows in Oregon — and only one team has ever run faster than Union Catholic at Holmdel Park — CBA ran 15:52 in 2013 — Union Catholic is right near the very top on the list of New Jersey’s all-time greatest teams.

The adjustable length makes use with different bikes very easy and the smooth quiet running of the rollers gives a decent road feel.

If the thought of getting on an indoor trainer and mindlessly pedalling away for an hour or so fills you with dread then rollers could be a very good option. They are a more engaging way to train indoors as just like on the road not paying attention is going to cause you to fall off.

Half an hour on these basic rollers passed far more quickly than an equivalent spin on my smart trainer hooked up to Zwift so if you find yourself getting really bored these basic rollers are a great solution.

Rollers also allow for the development of basic cycling skills such as pedalling smoothness. The only way you're going to stay in the centre of the rollers is by using a smooth pedalling technique so away from the simple physical workout you can also perfect your pedal stroke.

The Antares Basic rollers don't have any resistance built in. The resistance comes from your tyres and there is a surprising amount of effort required to get your biggest gears going.

Up at those top wheel speeds the rollers do produce more noise than a turbo trainer so you might want to give these a miss if you live in a block of flats.

For warming up the rollers are very good. Not only can you get a good sweat on while you wait to start your race the focus required to not fall off and look like an idiot really helped me to get in the zone for racing.

Lobbing a bike onto the rollers is simple and folding them away is easy so if you are running late for the start they're not going to hold you up.

If you are just looking for a warm-up option I'd also consider something like Feedback Sport's Omnium hybrid rollers. They are quite a bit more expensive at £350 but they eliminate the possibility of falling off in the car park.

The Antares Basics are cheaper than the Elite Arion Parabolic rollers (£199.99) and the JetBlack R1 (£189.99) but if you can spend a little bit more the Tacx Galaxia Advanced rollers come in at £219.99 and add movement to the rear wheel to better simulate the feel of riding on the road.

Conclusion

Rollers are far more immersive than even a gamified app such as Zwift and if you want a basic set then these Antares Basics are brilliant. The ride is smooth and they are quick to deploy so getting going is easy. For pre-race warm-ups I'd highly recommend them.

It’s a bold ambition given the enduring popularity of the Apple Watch and other offerings from the likes of Samsung and Garmin but it seems that the company does have some truly innovative ideas to try and distinguish the Facebook Smartwatch from most of the other devices on our list of the best smartwatches.

Putting aside the issue of whether people actually want Facebook on their wrist as well as their phones the company has a mixed record when it comes to hardware. The Oculus Quest 2 is deservedly a runaway success but Facebook Portal less so. And while few will remember the HTC ChaCha — a smartphone with a dedicated Facebook button — those that do will recall that it hardly set the world alight.

Here’s everything we know about the Facebook Smartwatch so far.

Facebook Smartwatch design

Although the quality varies massively there’s very little material difference between one smartwatch and another at the moment. But suffice it to say Facebook is considering a major disruption in this respect.

We’re apparently looking at a detachable display — something we haven’t seen since the Fitbit Blaze. But while the long retired Fitbit allowed you to remove the body of the watch for charging here it’s for photographs and video. You can see how this might look in a patent diagram below uncovered by GizChina.

(Image credit: GizChina)

According to The Verge’s sources the front of the screen will have a basic camera for video calls from the wrist (with a notch unfortunately) but removing the display from the case will reveal a 1080p auto-focus camera for both photos and video. The idea is for users to capture both snaps and footage of their daily adventures for easy sharing with Facebook much like the company’s recent glasses Ray-Ban Stories.

This design also means that Meta is apparently considering unconventional ways of wearing it when not on the wrist. Two inside sources have said that the company is discussing the camera with third parties meaning it could be mounted like a GoPro.

One other more conventional detail: apparently the wearable is likely to come in white black or gold.

Facebook Smartwatch features

The curious thing about a design that seems entirely focused around photography and video capture is that the earliest report about a Facebook Smartwatch didn’t even mention cameras.

Instead the report from The Information claimed that the watch would be focusing on messaging and heath. For the former Facebook Messenger is said to be baked in and for the latter the company is apparently looking at the possibility of tie-ins with companies like Peloton.

Curiously this early report also said that the Facebook Smartwatch would not need a smartphone to run with the company instead apparently talking to carriers about LTE support. While that may seem odd given smartwatches’ most useful feature is the delivery of notifications this might at least make privacy-conscious users more inclined to give the Facebook Smartwatch a spin.

The watch will apparently run on a custom version of Android but not Wear OS. Though it’s claimed that this is only for the first version with subsequent upgrades moving towards an operating system developed by Meta itself.

The first generation of Facebook Smartwatch is anticipated at some point in 2022 with a second-generation version possibly following in 2023.

The Verge’s report says that the Facebook Smartwatch will be in the $400 region putting it somewhat optimistically firmly in Apple Watch territory.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FkZ2V0c2FuZHdlYXJhYmxlcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8xNi9nYXJtaW4tZXBpeC0yLWJ1eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Epix 2: who is the Fenix 7 with AMOLED aimed at?,"5 min read

On January 18th the Garmin Fenix 7 and Epix 2 will launch. Despite the number 2 in its name the latter is the new kid on the block. But who is it meant for?

There have been lots of leaks and rumours in the past few weeks on upcoming Garmin watches. The company has not officially confirmed or denied any of them although it has teased an international product launch event to be held at 15:00 GMT (10am EST) on Tuesday January 18th. Not that we needed a teaser. Some Garmin regional outlets such as the ones from Israel and Norway had already posted information about a launch happening on that day.

Essential reading: Best fitness trackers and health gadgets

Of course Garmin has not revealed what new products it will unveil. It never does ahead of time. But it is pretty safe to assume that we will see the next iteration in the Fenix range along with Epix 2. There have been too many leaks to expect otherwise. Not to mention the FCC filings.

The Fenix already has a loyal following. But what about Epix 2? Garmin Forerunners are for meant for runners the Fenix range is a robust outdoorsy watch for those into multi-sports. Who is the Epix 2 aimed at?

A Garmin Fenix with an AMOLED display

Simply put Epix 2 will be pretty much the same as Fenix 7. The important difference will be the inclusion of an AMOLED display instead of a transflective screen.

Garmin already has a watch with an AMOLED display – the Venu. The range actually received a new addition a couple of weeks ago that came in the form of Venu 2 Plus. The main upgrades are the addition of a third physical button microphone and speaker. These are used to access the voice assistant.

The relationship between Fenix 7 and Epix 2 will be similar to that of Vivoactive and Venu. Pretty much the same functionality the important difference being the quality of display.

The mid-range (47mm) Fenix 7 will come with a touch display measuring 1.3 inches. The Epix 2 will be the same sized and also touch enabled. But its resolution at 416 x 416 pixels will be much higher than the 260 x 260 pixels of the Fenix. Those that prefer the five physical buttons will be happy to know both watches will continue to work with them. Reportedly you’ll even be able to switch off the touch functionality.

The AMOLED display has the advantage of being brighter more high-res it has a higher speed of rendering so it is easier to read. That should go a long way with athletes whose eyes are getting worse with age or just those that want a prettier display.

The caveat is that while these types of screens are great for indoors they can be hard to see outdoors in bright sunshine. Having said that there are claims that Epix 2 will have good readability even in these conditions. Nevertheless it is unlikely to match the readability in direct sunlight of the memory-in-pixel display of the Fenix.

A target for Epix 2 will be those that want a Venu but don’t want to give up rich features of the Fenix range. So don’t be surprised if you suddenly see some of the Venu crowd selling their watches in order to buy Epix 2. We suspect female athletes are also going to appreciate the more fashionable Epix 2. Although with a 47mm diameter the watch is going to be pretty large.

The sacrifice is battery life

But its not all good news. A fancy screen has consequences that come in the form of shorter battery life. One way around this is to switch off the always-on option. If you can tolerate your watch display sometimes going blank and waking up only when you tap on it – you’ll get decent battery life.

The regular Fenix 7 will have 18 days of battery juice in smartwatch mode. With GPS this falls to 57 hours. The Epix 2 on the other hand will run for 16 days in smartwatch mode and 42 hours in GPS mode. But that’s with the always-on option switched off. You are unlikely to get a week in smartwatch mode with an AMOLED display that never goes dark. In fact you can expect to get around six days – which is still not bad.

Garmin seems to be dipping their toes in water with Epix 2. For that reason it is rumoured there will only be a single size. The Fenix 7 is expected to come in a regular X and S variant. It will also have a solar option.

Finally there is the question of price. Whatever you choose Epix 2 or Fenix 7 you’ll have to part with a large chunk of cash. You’re looking at around $900 for the first. The Fenix 7 will start at around 700 euros and go up from there depending on the size you choose whether you want solar titanium build etc.

Update (18/1/2022). You can buy the Fenix 7 and Epix 2 watches on Amazon (links: Fenix 7 Epix 2) and Garmin’s website. Check out our detailed comparison on how Garmin Fenix 7 Epix 2 and Fenix 6 compare.

The warehouse robotics startup announced today that it has raised $335m at a $2bn valuation making it the fourth French company to leap past the much-hyped benchmark in 2022 already. With the first month of the year barely begun Exotec follows PayFit Ankorstore and Qonto into the unicorn stable.

Throw in Back Market which raised $510m to become France’s most valuable startup last week and the ecosystem may be experiencing a severe case of vertigo. Exotec is emblematic of how rapidly Europe’s startup expectations are being upended including creating new challenges for early-stage investors — albeit happy ones — as they digest once-unthinkable returns.

But Exotec also stands out in one important way. Unlike the other French unicorns which have leveraged trends such as fintech the cloud and marketplaces Exotec builds physical products.

“We are super proud of having done a unicorn with hardware with engineers and technicians all over the world” said Exotec CEO Romain Moulin. “It's also a recognition from the investors that they are ready to invest in this area. And it’s proof that we can build such a scaleup with all industrial aspects.”

Hardware dreams

Almost a decade ago as the French tech ecosystem began making its bid for relevancy the hope was that a company such as Exotec would be the rule rather than the exception.

Hardware and connected objects emerged as a central theme in France’s startup push with proponents believing the nation’s legacy as a leader in design manufacturing and engineering offered all the necessary ingredients for success. Sigfox which was building a communications network for connected objects became one of its early unicorns. And the government paid for large batches of startups to attend CES in Las Vegas each year to demonstrate the country's prowess.

Yet apart from a few companies like connected e-health leader Withings the hardware hype failed to yield a crop of transformative startups. Even Sigfox struggled to deliver the growth needed to justify its once lofty valuation.

But while the hardware hype faded Exotec continued to quietly build momentum.

Amazon automation

Moulin founded Exotec with Renaud Heitz in 2015. The pair met while working on robotics for GE Healthcare in Paris. They became intrigued by Amazon’s announcement that it had acquired a startup called Kiva Systems and would use its robotics to automate its warehouses.

Kiva’s inventory system relied on robots that zipped across warehouse floors to gather goods from the shelves and bring them to human packers. But suddenly it was exclusively the property of Amazon leaving an opening that the Exotec cofounders believed they could fill.

“At that moment they showed everybody that technology was a driver for logistics and logistics was a driver for success” Moulin said. “So that was really the starting point.”

Exotec’s autonomous Skypod robots now form the basis of a system that any retailer can install in their warehouse to automate tasks like retrieving goods from shelves and sorting them into the correct bins for shipping. What sets it apart from many competitors is that Skypods can move vertically as well scaling shelves as high as 36 feet to retrieve orders.

Over the past seven years the company has continued to refine the accuracy speed and variety of tasks the robots can perform. That includes the development of its Skypicker technology a robotic arm that further improves sorting to speed order fulfilment.

Exotec's Skypicker is a robotic arm that sorts orders in warehouses.

This efficiency has proved particularly crucial during the pandemic. The robots can fetch more than five times as many items as a human. With ecommerce soaring and consumers’ service expectations rising accelerating logistics has become a priority for retailers. And with many warehouses now struggling to hire enough employees any labour-saving automation is being embraced.

“The mindset has changed from before the pandemic” Moulin said. “We still had some logistics people thinking ‘Should I go for robotics automation?’ And now the question is ‘When will I go to robotics?’ They know that it's the future.”

[Before the pandemic] we still had some logistics people thinking ‘Should I go for robotics automation? Now the question is ‘When will I go to robotics?’

Exotec has seen its annual revenues grow from €20m in 2019 to €105m in 2021. It’s won major customers like Uniqlo in Japan Decathlon in Canada and Gap in the US. And with offices in Atlanta Munich and Tokyo the company expects to double revenues in 2022 and add another 500 employees to its current headcount of 350 by 2025.

The growth comes despite intensifying competition in the warehouse automation space. Not only are big industrial players investing in this market but there are startup rivals such as Norway’s AutoStore which went public last year and US-based InVia.

Capital conundrum

Exotec’s international success in the face of such competition caught the attention of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The investor led the funding round which also included the participation of previous investors such as 83North and Dell Technologies Capital. The company has now raised a total of $477m and counts among its investors Bpifrance Iris Capital 360 Capital Partners and Breega.

For Breega Exotec’s rise has created an embarrassment of returns.

François Paulus cofounded Breega in 2013 with the first fund of €45m for early-stage and Series A startups. Among the first investments he made was Exotec just after meeting the cofounders and seeing an early prototype of the Skypod that had been built using angel investor money.

The pair convinced Breega even as some of its other hardware portfolio companies were stumbling. Breega invested €5m — the maximum allowed under the first fund’s rules. Along the way the firm has taken money to return to investors as a way to further build its credibility.

At the same time it has continued to reinvest creating special purpose vehicles at times to bring its total in Exotec to €30m. Paulus said Breega wants to maintain a position in Exotec to reap potentially even bigger returns down the road.

While Paulus won’t reveal exact figures Exotec represents by far Breega’s biggest multiple. Its success has helped the firm raise subsequent funds bringing its total under management to €260m.

“Most of our LPs are overexcited and they want to invest again in new funds” Paulus said. “And I can raise a new fund and sell it to prospective LPs who did not invest in previous funds and say ‘You know guys this is what you missed.’ It’s definitely changing the way we can raise funds.”",,,,,,,,,

They’re putting the stock back in stock car.

For the first time the chassis design will be identical from team to team. The frames are issued by a supplier now longer are teams designing and building their own cars from scratch.

The idea is to drastically reduce costs. At the same time it’s expected to level the playing field from powerhouse teams to the underfunded operations.

There’s a lot of change. One of the biggest is the modular design of the frame. The frame is assembled in three separate pieces.

“The chassis system is designed to be modular on Next Gen to allow the front clip center section and the rear clip to bolt together and be interchangeable” said Brandon Thomas Managing Director of NASCAR Vehicle Systems.

“Any front clip will fit any center section will fit the rear clip. It’s done for ease of repair ease of turn around of cars between events. And for ease of setups for the teams.”

Ease of repair explained

The ease of repair has already been put to use. In November Austin Dillon spun out and crashed during the recent test at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

Located just up the road from the track is the home of Richard Childress Racing. The team was able to take the car to the shop and bring the same one back to the track.

“That showed everybody that this car has a tremendous amount of potential. From the time he wrecked to the time we got back to the track a new snout tail nose everything 9 hours” Richard Childress explained.

NASCAR Next Gen supply issues?

Stewart-Haas Racing didn’t participate in the Daytona test. Joe Gibbs Racing only brought one machine.

That’s a product of a low inventory in cars. Teams can’t risk crashing too many cars ahead of the season.

The season begins in the LA Coliseum in early February. That will be followed by a week of racing at Daytona International Speedway. Are they ready?

NASCAR: John Probst

“We’re still on track for 5 cars per time. The latest tracking we have out of the supplier” NASCAR’s John Probst stated.

“And that’s 5 center sections and seven front and rear clips. It’s kinda like 5+ a little bit.”

“We’re not immune to the world. We’re seeing COVID and supply chains being delayed. Right now we don’t see any parts of pieces that are going to keep any car from racing in an event.”

Probst added “We’re working with the teams to make sure we implement backup cars in an efficient manner. While we concerned that’s what we do we worry about things like that.”

Richard Childress Racing

“We have two right now per car and the season starts pretty soon” Richard Childress said of his supply per team.

“You always got some concerns but I think NASCAR is approaching it right from a safety standpoint. We went back after each test the crash test we would go back and make changes. That’s one reason we kinda got behind.”

Childress thinks they’ll have three cars per team before the start of the season.

Childress added “There’s shortages on pieces but we’re going to be ok I think.”

Brad Keselowski

Brad Keselowski said “This car’s easier to turn over than cars in the past by a good ways. But it’s still a lot of work. Big challenge for them in the next few months because of the inventory constraints.”

Keselowski added “Outside of having another COVID lockdown or some significant accidents I think we’ll have enough cars to race. But I am concerned about the emotional and physical well-being of some of the people that work on the race cars.”

However they ""hesitated"" with this label due to the generation's young ages (all are in their early 20s or are teens). Nonetheless Gen Z stuck. According to Distractify the ""Z"" in Gen Z ""doesn't actually stand for anything specific."" In fact it has everything to do with the previous generations Generation X and Generation Y. Dictionary writes that Generation X are those born between 1960 and 1980. Generation Y are none other than Millennials.

Per Forbes the term Millennials was created in 1991 by historians Neil Howe and William Strauss for their book ""Generations: The History of America's Future 1584 to 2069."" They predicted that Generation Y was going to be wildly different from previous generations because kids were being raised with more ""structure and protection."" Thus they decided it needed ""a distinct name"" and the term Millennial was born.

That being said Generation Z is named so simply because it succeeds Generation X and Y. As the Willamette Week explained in 2018 however it's likely that the name will eventually change.

The advent of the internet and digital technologies hastened the change even further. Today’s world is drastically different from the world 50 years ago. Technology has impacted every aspect of life and the workplaces are no different. Technology has not only brought speed and efficiency to the work; it has also enabled people to work longer. Today offices are seeing several generations working together. The Baby boomers Millennials and Gen X all are working together under the same roof and often on the same projects. Well it is not the first time that several generations are sharing workplaces; however there has never been a bigger difference in the working style and thought process of two consecutive generations like the current times. Some organisations struggle in striking the balance between the different generations working together while others use this generation gap to their advantage.

Baby boomers have seen and experienced all the major changes that happened in the past 50 years. They have seen the work getting done at the snail’s pace as well as the speed of light. They have experienced all the ups and downs of technology. They might not be tech-savvy and their ability to learn a new thing or quickly adapt to the new changes might have diminished; however their experience long-term knowledge and interpersonal skills cannot be discounted.

On the other hand Gen X is equipped with the latest skills and knowledge. They have not seen or experienced a slow-moving world. For them every piece of information is available on the internet within a matter of a few clicks. For them it is hard to imagine a world without the internet and google. Gen X is bustling with energy and ideas. They are the ones who are powering the world with new ideas and innovation. The significance at the workplaces is marked by new ideas efficiency speed technological affinity adaptability and high energy.

The millennials are perhaps the most important generation of the current times. Born between 1980 and the mid-90s this generation has seen it all. This generation is well versed in the ways of the past and is skilled in the technologies of the present. This generation has a unique amalgamation of values of the past and the speed of the present.

Organisations should consider the millennials as the focal point when it comes to striking the balance between the generations. Millennials should be utilized as the ones connecting the two other generations almost 30 years apart. The older generation by virtue of its experience patience and soft skills can be vital in the policy formation planning budgeting and personnel management of any organisation. They have seen so many changes during their lifetime that they can anticipate various upcoming situations and trends in the market. On the other hand Gen X has the ability to learn new things and adapt to any rapid changes. When it comes to the execution of the plans implementation of the policies and adoption of new technologies the role of Gen X becomes extremely important.

During the times of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown when work from home was implemented it was observed that the Baby boomers found it quite difficult to adjust to the new situation however Gen X was quick to adapt to it. While when the course of action for the organisations during and after the pandemic was to be decided the older generation took the lead.

The role of millennials is important in both policy formulation as well as implementation. However their most important role is as the bridge between the Baby boomers and the Gen X. They are the ones who can understand the conservative language of the older generation and speak in the language of the new generation.

Baby boomers Gen X and Millennials all have different outlook and behavioral approaches towards various situations and knitting all of them together to achieve organizational objectives may be a difficult task to perform. Any organization that strives to achieve long term growth looks at accommodating all the thoughts that can sync and move together. A good team is always a mix of Veterans Mature and Young blood that can bring different energies to build synergies. There may be certain technological obstacles that a person in his 50s good at strategy might experience whereas it might be an easy task for a millennial that could bring some differences among people and result in groupism/ gaps. The balance needs to be maintained in the form of technology experience and organizational requirements so that all the people remain motivated and work in a unified manner.

For any organisation’s success the role of all three generations is critical. Maintaining the right balance between the three generations can be the difference between the success and failure of any organisation especially in times as dynamic as the current ones.

Loading Afterpay’s mortgages will be funded by Westpac but even so it shows the potential of fintech apps to move into the banks’ core territory. Up a youth-focused neobank bought by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank in 2021 also plans to start selling home loans through its app in early 2022. Up was launched in 2018 providing digital accounts - and in November it said it had 40000 customers saving for a home loan. Up chief executive Xavier Shay says its mortgage product will aim to win over customers by giving them financial tips - such as a nudge to repay their loan faster if it notices they are saving more than thought. “Right now state of the art is you type some numbers into a calculator or maybe make a spreadsheet and most people don’t want to be making spreadsheets” Shay says.

Bendigo-backed Tic:Toc which will provide technology for Up to approve digital loans is another example of a fast-growing digital mortgage business - it also relies on Bendigo for funding. Up and away Up chief executive Xavier Shay (second from left) says young people want their mortgage where their money is. Credit: ... Non-bank lenders such as Nano Digital Home Loans and Athena Home Loans are also eyeing a piece of the action alongside older businesses such as Loans.com.au owned by Firstmac. Athena’s co-founder and chief operating officer Michael Starkey says about 45 per cent of Athena’s customers are Gen Y and its commissioned surveys have shown 74 per cent of millennials are either “somewhat” or “very” favourable towards using a non-bank lender. With other digital businesses like REA Group’s realestate.com.au also targeting home loans Starkey argues there’s an opportunity for the business to make finance more “embedded” in the wider process of buying a home.

Nano’s co-founder and chief executive Andrew Walker argues COVID-19 has accelerated the shift to digital applications arguing digital home loans are “rapidly becoming the norm”. “If you look at the global data you’ll see that Australia is far behind the rest of the world where currently less than 3 to 5 per cent of mortgages are originated digitally compared to 30 per cent in the US” Walker says. “We originally anticipated it to be 3-5 year market shift but we now believe that it will take place over the next 12 – 18 months.” Not everyone is convinced that digital home loans are set to take over. Given the complexity and high stakes of taking out a home loan mortgage brokers arrange a large share of new loans and some survey data suggests even young digital-savvy customers still want to deal with a human when taking out a loan.

A 2020 survey by Finder.com suggested more than half of Gen Y and Gen Z still wanted to visit a branch for a mortgage. The surge in house prices in recent years has also made it even harder for many younger customers to break into the property market. But in any case there is little doubt that digital home lending is emerging as a key battleground in banking - just as approval processes were a critical issue for lenders in 2021. At their full-year results each of the big four banks were busily talking their moves to make mortgage lending more digital and faster with both Commonwealth Bank and ANZ Bank talking up the prospect of a 10-minute mortgage in 2022. A spokeswoman for CBA the country’s biggest bank says the lender will launch its digital loan in the first half of the year. In the longer term experts predict even more sweeping changes to mortgage lending from “open banking” a system that allows consumers to securely share their financial data when applying for a loan. James Cameron a partner at AirTree Ventures (which has invested in Athena) says in 10 years’ time taking out a loan could be as simple as answering a few questions on a smartphone: your name some proof of identity the amount you want to borrow and the property’s address.

“I think it will happen slowly and then it will happen fast” Cameron says of the disruption in mortgages. “The good banks will be able to keep up with these trends” he says. Technology giants such as Apple and Google are also lurking in the background as they muscle into the payments market through their digital wallet apps. There is a question mark over how these global behemoths might use their enormous customer reach and huge amounts of customer data to target other parts of the banking business - including lending - in the long term. Afterpay’s future owner US fintech giant Block is another example of a foreign tech-based giant that could play a bigger role in the Australian market. ‘I think it will happen slowly and then it will happen fast.’ James Cameron AirTree Ventures The intentions that giants such as Apple have in banking are unclear but they would be formidable competitors if they sought to gain a bigger slice of the banking market beyond payments."

Brent Stirton/Getty Images

Top US companies and trade groups have donated more than $8.1 million to Republican lawmakers who voted against Joe Biden's certification as president according to a report by watchdog Accountable.US.

After a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol on January 6 2021 many companies scrambled to cut ties with the 147 GOP lawmakers who voted against certifying the 2020 election result.

Dozens of companies including Walmart Amazon Morgan Stanley and AT&T said they would stop donating to these 147 Republican lawmakers – a group dubbed the Sedition Caucus by political opponents. Others including Microsoft Deloitte and Goldman Sachs said they would pause all political donations.

But Accountable.US says donations to the GOP election objectors soon recovered.

""What makes no sense is why major corporations chose to reward the politicians that weaponized Donald Trump's Big Lie with millions of dollars in campaign cash"" Kyle Herrig president of Accountable.US told Insider.

In the aftermath of the Capitol siege ""many big-name companies assured their customers and employees how much they value our democracy but it's obvious they value something more – holding political influence over as many lawmakers as possible even if those lawmakers voted to subvert our government"" Herrig said.

Here are some of the top donors to the GOP election objectors per Accountable.US's corporate donations tracker which is based on Federal Election Commission (FEC) data on direct donations from Fortune 500 companies and 700 trade associations.

The United States military is finally replacing the beloved M4 along with the M249 squad automatic weapon (SAW). This change is said to be coming in 2021. This will be the first major weapons platform change since 1994 when the M4 became the standard issue rifle for the United States military. Now it’s time for a change. Not only is the military swapping out platforms but it’s also changing calibers.

The military was seeking out something that had manageable recoil and high velocity like 5.56 but also wanted something with superior stopping power like 7.62. Despite having lethality on its side the U.S. wanted to avoid the heaviness and higher recoil of the 7.62 cartridge. This ended with the selection of 6.8 mm.

6.8 mm was specifically designed to address the long-distance ballistics issues of 5.56 NATO and serve as a way to close the gap between 5.56 and 7.62. It can’t match the stopping power of the 7.62 but it’s lighter faster and has less recoil. 6.8 is also more easily controlled in burst fire.

There are 3 contenders bidding to be the new platform for the new 6.8mm: Sig Sauer General Dynamics and Textron Systems.

Sig Sauer brings the MCX Spear to the table sporting a familiar design to the M4. Meaning little additional training will be necessary for soldiers to adapt to the new platform. Its weight is probably the same as the M4 as well but no specifics have been given except that it’s under 10 pounds. What’s interesting is that all Spear rifles come with a built-in suppressor to counter the muzzle blast (recoil) from the new cartridge. Eventually the MCX Spear will be fitted with a fire control group called the Vortex system. It’s a suite of optics rangefinders and even a ballistic computer. This technology could lead to the average soldier having superior shooting ability even without sharpshooter training. The computer determines the trajectory of the bullet before it’s fired making it almost trivial to land shots.

They also have the 6.8 LMG on the table but even fewer details have been given out about the MCX Spear’s sibling firearm. Sig Sauer claims that its new LMG platform weighs 40 percent less than its predecessors. Recoil is also said to be “dramatically” reduced in the new platform. The new LMG will also feature quick-detach magazines more M-LOK rail space the aforementioned suppressor and “vastly improves upon the operation and function of the legacy M249.”

The military will be selecting one of the three companies by October of 2021. After that the selected company will have a year to make rifles for the 2022 rollout. These rifles won’t be given out to all U.S. soldiers though. Special forces and recon are among the first to receive the rifles with the rest to receive them in the following years.

Freeman said last week that his office has devoted additional lawyers to carjacking cases and intensified prosecution of juvenile suspects. His lawyers pressed charges in 80% of all cases from Minneapolis last year he said. He also said he has won convictions for some of the most dangerous crimes of the past year prosecuting a dozen homicide cases including those involving armed felons.

Freeman also pushed back against what he characterized as critics' simplistic view that a get-tough approach will stop these crimes.

""There has to be more than a philosophy of putting a person in jail and throwing away the key"" he said in an interview with the Star Tribune. ""If a kid steals a car you want to intervene before he commits a violent carjacking.""

Freeman has said he is not running for re-election after a finishing a sixth term. Now he is contending with a crime surge that is drawing considerable time attention and criticism in his final year in office.

Minneapolis police reported a record of more than 600 attempted or successful carjackings in 2021. The crime spree has spilled into many suburbs including Edina St. Louis Park Eden Prairie Robbinsdale Roseville Maplewood and Woodbury.

The crime surge is particularly acute in Minneapolis which recorded soaring numbers of violent crimes last year as the police department contends with a wave of nearly 300 retirements resignations and an unpresented level of PTSD claims over the past couple of years.

Earlier this month seven suburban mayors wrote a letter asking Freeman to get tougher on criminals and revisit a new policy in which suspects no longer need to post bail for nearly 20 low-level crimes like possessing a small amount of narcotics and theft under $35000.

""There is a sense of lawlessness and lack of accountability that is stemming from criminals who commit crimes and then are being turned back to the street in short order — with little or no consequence — and that conduct is repeated"" the letter read.

When he unveiled the change Freeman said there is no proof that imposing bail on low-level offenses reduces crime. He said it merely punishes low-income defendants who risk losing their jobs and their homes. Instead of bail suspects in these crimes now must promise to make all court appearances and are free until their next court hearing.

The avalanche of criticism and concerns thrown at Freeman heated up a month ago when more than 300 people jammed into an Edina meeting after a brazen carjacking in the parking lot of a Lunds & Byerlys grocery store.

Edina Mayor Jim Hovland said he was surprised that most of the public comments focused on what was deemed ineffective prosecution of first-time offenders and lax sentences for repeat criminals.

But even Hovland acknowledged that solutions are not easy.

""We have had two more attempted carjackings since the incident at the grocery store"" he said. ""One of the kids that was caught was a 12-year-old girl. What do you do? You can't jail her. How do you get her out of an environment where there might not be anything but trouble ahead?""

After the meeting Hovland scheduled a private breakfast meeting with Freeman to talk about his concerns and frustrations. That breakfast prompted Freeman to invite Hovland to join a gathering of the state's top criminal judicial system officials police chiefs and mayors from across the Twin Cities last week.

Before the latest wave of crime Freeman announced a private-public partnership that he believes will tamp down juvenile offenses much like the original Hope Education and Law & Safety (HEALS) effort did in Minneapolis during a violent and deadly surge in the mid-1990s.

MN HEALS 2.0 works with Minneapolis and Hennepin County business and faith leaders to engage with young people sooner before problems arise.

The project is just taking shape but in the 1990s companies such as General Mills spent money on social programs sports activities gang violence intervention job training and job placement. It even included community centers.

This time Freeman said the program will bring in suburban police community leaders and social workers. The plan is to focus on reducing serious violent crime with juvenile carjackings a priority.

""It is important that we take stock of what is working what needs to be re-evaluated what we can learn from our own past successes and failures and to make sure this analysis is based on facts"" Freeman said. ""We need ways to get kids back in school and have GED programs sports activities mental health services gang violence intervention mentors and job training and placement.""

Plymouth Mayor Jeffry Wosje said he was not happy with Freeman's new policy ending bail for low-level offenses. His police chief along with others was upset that auto theft was initially included in the offenses no longer requiring bail.

Hearing the criticism Freeman resumed requiring bail for car theft.

Now more state leaders are getting involved.

On Friday DFL Gov. Tim Walz convened a private call with suburban police chiefs to discuss the crime surge.

For his part Freeman plans to meet with police chiefs this week to hear their concerns.

""If he really listens maybe some things start to change"" said Wosje the mayor of Plymouth. ""Barring that sometimes a new voice is helpful.""

Maple Grove Police Chief Eric Werner who is also president of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association said the surge in violent crime is a result of policies implemented or influenced by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.

Werner was among a group that sent a letter to Freeman asking his office to be more aggressive in prosecutions revisit the bail reform initiative and consider criteria to penalize juveniles more harshly for serious crimes.

But mainly Werner said he and other chiefs simply want to be consulted as these policies are debated. He said the chiefs were caught off-guard by Freeman's bail changes.

""We need to be at the table when changes are made in his office to see the impact on law enforcement"" he said. ""We aren't seeing enough accountability for defendants.""

Freeman said his office is always pursuing a balance being tough on crime while acting thoughtfully on justice reforms and diversion programs for low-level offenders and people of color. He now has two teams specializing in prosecuting carjackings and also has a victim advocate. He said his staff is constantly reviewing cases to determine whether to charge a juvenile as an adult.

Besides tackling the latest crime surge he is also working to create a statewide policy on high-speed pursuits and to reduce the soaring number of Native American children in foster care.

He is scrambling to get these things done in his final year as well as tamp down carjackings.

""I just don't want to mark time until I'm done"" he said.

As the food industry has adapted since the pandemic began nearly two years ago many food suppliers and grocery stores had been expecting things would be improving by now. But “Omicron has put a bit of a dent” in that Vivek Sankaran CEO at Albertsons Cos said this week in a conference call with industry analysts. “We would expect more supply challenges over the next four to six weeks … As a business we’ve all learned to manage it we’ve all learned to make sure that the stores are still very presentable and give the consumers as much choice as we can get.”

But Omicron isn’t the only thing to blame. Labor shortages severe weather shipping delays and changes in what foods people are buying make it difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for shortages.

What foods are out of stock at any given time also seem to vary. Early on in the pandemic as people were panic-stockpiling basic amenities items like rice bread and toilet paper were difficult to find. Now shortages are affecting everything from mustard to cat food. So if you feel like you’re losing your mind because your favorite brand of pretzels has suddenly disappeared from supermarket shelves you’re not. Curt Covington from AgAmerica told USA TODAY that “shortages depend on the item store and region of the country.” When the pandemic and unpredictable weather meets the complexity of the supply chain what’s out of stock can also change week to week.

As of Jan. 9 the states with the biggest shortages of food and beverages included Alaska Alabama Hawaii Mississippi and West Virginia according to data from IRI a Chicago-based market research firm. Geoff Freeman of the Consumer Brands Association expresses concerns that we could be facing more shortages as the Omicron variant moves through the Midwest where major packaged food companies like Kellogg Co. and General Mills Inc. have operations.

Why your favorite foods may be out of stock

Labor shortages and shipping delays may be what first come to mind when you hear “supply chain issues.” But there are some other factors at play that may be causing those empty supermarket shelves.

Changing consumer behaviors

At the CFA National Food Policy Conference in October Freeman of the Consumer Brands Association explained some of the changes in consumer behavior as a result of the pandemic. When the pandemic began people started stockpiling. But what he found was that instead of getting back to “normal” levels once people got accustomed to the pandemic the heightened level of demand persisted. Consumer demand actually increased by 9 percent from 2020 to 2021 he said. People started buying more and that has become a new normal.

Not only are people buying more food but the foods they’re buying have also changed. In addition to more people cooking and eating at home instead of going out people have been buying more frozen foods and snack foods as they hunker down at home. Changing consumer tastes adds another hoop for the supply chain to jump through.

Panelists also discussed how consumers are more concerned about climate change which has changed how they buy food. Joseph Clayton from the International Food Information Council cited IFIC’s 2021 Food and Health Survey which found that seven in 10 consumers say that climate change sometimes influences their purchase decisions. As people grow more weary of climate change some are changing their diets to be more plant-based. The Food Institute reported that as a result the availability of frozen fruit and vegetables has taken a hit.

Extreme weather and climate change

From snowstorms in the Northeast to wildfires in Colorado extreme weather can not only affect the productivity of food processing plants and make it harder to transport food products around the country but it can also lead some shoppers to stock up more than usual which puts more pressure on the supply chain.

The Food Institute reported tomato paste and mustard shortages triggered by droughts in California and Western Canada. As winter storms move through the Northeast and Midwest more shoppers are complaining of food shortages. Droughts in Canada and the Northern Plains of the United States have led to a sharp decrease in wheat supplies. For the second year in a row La Niña a global weather pattern that causes heavy rainfall is threatening South American corn and soybean crops.

What foods are in short supply

While food shortages vary widely across different regions states and grocery stores here are some of the items that may require more of a scavenger hunt to find:

Baby formula

Cream cheese

Canned goods

Cat and dog food

Chicken tenders

Potatoes

Spinach

Pasta

Meat

Lettuce

Eggs

Chrysler aims to be all electric by 2028

Chrysler plans go all electric by 2028 the latest automaker to announce a shift away from gasoline-powered engines under rising pressure to act on climate change.

The company said Wednesday that it will launch its first electric vehicle by 2025. Chrysler announced its electric plans along with a new AI-enabled vehicle system powered by a battery that it says can travel 350 to 400 miles (563 to 644 kilometers) per charge.

Fiat Chrysler is part of Europe’s Stellantis the parent company that also owns PSA Peugeot.

“Our brand will serve at the forefront as Stellantis transforms to deliver clean mobility and connected customer experiences” Chris Feuell CEO of the Chrysler brand said in a news release.

Stellantis last month announced a strategy to embed AI-enabled software in 34 million vehicles across its 14 brands in a bid to gain $22.6 billion (20 billion euros) in annual revenue by 2030. It’s part of a broad transformation in the auto industry as companies race toward more fully electric and hybrid propulsion systems more autonomous driving features and increased connectivity in cars.

All top automakers are working on electric vehicles amid concerns about climate change.

‘72 Plymouth Barracuda caused quite a row

One man’s problem was certainly Larry Eber’s gain. Eber of Van Wert called a guy at the right time and got this beautiful all original 1972 Plymouth Barracuda for a great price.

Eber had been looking for a car. He had been to Indiana at the Mecum Car Show and found nothing. He got back home and looked on the Internet. He found the listing for this 1972 Plymouth Barracuda and called the guy.

“He had gotten in trouble with a woman. The guy had gone out and bought a Harley much to her disdain. It was February in Buffalo New York and her Cadillac was not going to sit outside in the weather” explained Eber.

It was February of 2014. The gentleman had to get rid of something as his garage was full.

“When he told me the price I thought it was too low. He informed me he had only one week to get rid of the car” said Eber. “We had a lot of discussions because I asked a lot of questions. I had the inspection list in front of me and he said ‘ask them all.’

Eber is now the proud owner of this beautiful Plymouth Barracuda. He has owned it for eight years. He brought the car to the Downtown Lima Car Show and Chicken BBQ held in the parking lot of Children Services.

Eber’s car contains a 340 four-barrel V8 engine.

The Plymouth Barracuda was a Pony car manufactured by Plymouth from 1964 through 1974. The sales brochure for the 1972 model year read: “The best looking sporty cars made in America.”

Eber had room in his garage and luckily found just the right car to fill that space.

Tesla to halt games on infotainment screens in moving cars

Under pressure from U.S. auto safety regulators Tesla has agreed to stop allowing videogames to be played on center touch screens while its vehicles are moving.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the company will send out a software update over the Internet so the function called “Passenger Play” will be locked and won’t work while vehicles are in motion.

The move comes after the agency announced it would open a formal investigation into distracted driving concerns about Tesla’s video games some of which could be played while cars are being driven.

An agency spokeswoman says in a statement Thursday that the change came after regulators discussed concerns about the system with Tesla. The first update went out Wednesday as part of Tesla’s holiday software release and the rest of the vehicles should get it today.

The statement says NHTSA regularly talks about infotainment screens with all automakers. A message was left Thursday seeking comment from Tesla which has disbanded its media relations department.

Ford U.S. sales down 6.8% in 2021 amid chip shortage

Ford Motor Co.’s U.S. sales dropped 6.8% year-over-year in 2021 to roughly 1.9 million vehicles according to numbers released Wednesday.

The dip in sales was consistent with the story of the automotive industry as a whole which saw sales slide due in large part to a semiconductor chip shortage that dampened auto production across the world for much of the year.

Still the Dearborn automaker managed to boost production and sales volume in the fourth quarter after being hit hard by the shortage earlier in the year. Ford said it was the best-selling automaker in Q4 and the only U.S. seller to hit 500000 sales in the three-month period. It also touted its gains in the electric vehicle market where it was the No. 2 automaker in 2021 behind market leader Tesla Inc.

In December Ford sold 173740 vehicles in the U.S. down 17.1% from December 2020.

In the fourth quarter the automaker sold 508451 vehicles up 26.8% from the previous quarter.

The 1987 Pontiac Pursuit aimed to show what cars would be like in the then-far-off year 2000. MotorWeek recently posted a period review to YouTube as part of the show's Retro Review series.

Pontiac's designers and engineers actually got some things right including satellite navigation—or at least the idea of it—plus integrated display screens. Other features were a bit unorthodox.

The Pursuit also had a steering yoke with two large handles and a number of thumb-activated toggles for a digital driver display which reminds us of the recently introduced Tesla Model S yoke. However while Tesla's version behaves more or less like a conventional steering wheel the Pursuit's yoke only turned 180 degrees lock-to-lock.

That's because the yoke was designed to work with a drive-by-wire four-wheel steering system with no mechanical connection to the road. That resulted in a ""total lack of road feel"" per the reviewer.

The steering system also allow the Pursuit to crab walk sideways not unlike the GMC Hummer EV. Tesla has also indicated that it will add a similar feature to the Cybertruck although it's unclear when that pickup will reach production.

The interior sported front bucket seats with integrated four-point harnesses built-in rear child seats and integrated screens for rear-seat passengers—similar to the rear-seat entertainment systems offered in many family vehicles today.

One technology Pontiac missed out on was electrification. The Pursuit was powered by a turbo-4 gasoline engine. However it set the stage for the all-electric GM Impact concept and the subsequent EV1 production model. The Pursuit's styling also touches on the ""kammback"" shape that for aerodynamic reasons remains the future for cars.

While much of the tech showcased in the Pursuit now a reality there is one gain that engineers then probably wouldn't have predicted: The kind of steady incremental battery progress that has made a 500-mile electric vehicle possible without any real packaging concessions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvYXV0b3MvY2hyeXNsZXIvMjAyMi8wMS8xNS9zdGVsbGFudGlzLXR1cm5zLTEtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktZWxlY3RyaWZpY2F0aW9uLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24vOTE5Mjc4MjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Stellantis turns 1 automaker faces two paths,"Your subscription supports:

The brand-new facility in Broadmeadows will feature best-in-class logistics operations and state of the art automation technology supporting GPC Asia Pacific’s position as a leader in the market as well as ambitious future growth plans.

GPC Asia Pacific executive general manager of logistics Jon Longbottom said that the company had “significant growth” over the past three years and that the new facility will have state-of-the-art technologies to improve the customer experience.

“Our new Broadmeadows distribution centre will have cutting-edge technology and operations to allow us to better support our stores resulting in better support and service to our entire customer base” he said.

“We are excited at the opportunities this brings for our business and the investment signals just how committed we are to the future success of the automotive aftermarket.”

The 25 hectare estate was opened in May last year by Asia-Pacific logistics business LOGOS. The estate plans sustainability initiatives including recycling 98 per cent of materials from the demolition of the existing buildings incorporating Colorbond roofing materials to reduce heat and a minimum of 98kW solar panels on all facilities.

The estate provides access to Melbourne’s key transport network including the Western Ring Road Tullamarine Freeway and the Hume Highway interchange as well as the Victorian government’s planned North East Link which is key for customers.

GPC partnered with business transformation consultancy TMX on its regional Australia and New Zealand supply chain network strategy and operational design.

TMX director of property Sam Dellios said the new facility will offer an automated goods-to-person shuttle and ‘very narrow aisle’ storage system which he said would “boost cubic capacity across GPC’s wide product range and support their future growth strategy.”

Broadmeadows Logistics Estate will on completion have about 127000 square metres of sustainable high quality warehousing space across five facilities.

The new GPC distribution centre is the third commitment at the estate and starts construction this month with completion due in the first quarter of 2023.

GPC Asia Pacific is Australia’s leading automotive parts business and includes Repco NAPA Auto Parts AMX McLeod’s Rare Spares Sparesbox with a network of more than 550 stores servicing retail and automotive trade customers across Australia and New Zealand.

Gilead withdraws use of Zydelig to treat two types of cancer

Gilead Sciences Inc has notified the U.S. health regulator of its decision to voluntarily withdraw the use of its drug Zydelig for two types of cancer - follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic leukemia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAxLzE2LzMtcGhhcm1hLXN0b2Nrcy13aXRoLWVzcGVjaWFsbHktanVpY3ktZGl2aWRlbmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Pharma Stocks With Especially Juicy Dividends,"These drugmakers should have no problems keeping the dividends flowing -- and growing.

Big pharmaceutical companies usually make big bucks. And many of them return a portion of their profits to investors in the form of dividends.

We asked three Motley Fool contributors to pick the pharma stocks that they think have especially juicy dividends. Here's why they chose AbbVie (ABBV -0.65%) Gilead Sciences (GILD 1.17%) and Pfizer (PFE 1.26%).

A Dividend Aristocrat that's performing well

Keith Speights (AbbVie): There's so much to like about AbbVie's dividend that it's hard to know where to begin. But I'll start with its attractive yield of 4.2%. What's even better though is that AbbVie is a Dividend Aristocrat -- an elite group of S&P 500 members that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.

Unlike some dividend stocks AbbVie has also delivered strong growth lately. Its shares soared 26% last year. With dividends included the drugmaker's total return easily beat the S&P 500's performance.

There are a couple of concerns for AbbVie though. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently placed additional warnings on the company's JAK inhibitor Rinvoq. This could limit the sales of the drug to some extent. Also AbbVie's top-selling drug Humira faces biosimilar rivals in the U.S. beginning in 2023. Sales are expected to decline significantly.

However AbbVie's dividend shouldn't be threatened at all. The company could also continue generating solid growth in the second half of this decade after the initial impact of Humira losing exclusivity. AbbVie has several other growth drivers including autoimmune disease drug Skyrizi and blood cancer drug Venclexta.

This biotech has boosted its dividend 51% in five years

David Jagielski (Gilead Sciences): Investing in a high-yielding dividend stock can be a great way to make the most of your money. But to ensure that inflation isn't chipping away at that cash flow over time you'll also want to invest in a company that raises its dividend payments. With Gilead Sciences investors are getting the best of both worlds -- a high yield of around 4% that has also been growing over the years.

Five years ago Gilead was paying its investors a quarterly dividend of $0.47. Today those payments are up to $0.71 rising by 51% during that time and averaging a compound annual growth rate of 8.6%. And that already-juicy dividend can get even more mouth-watering as the company's payout ratio sits below 50%.

In Gilead's latest quarterly update sales rose 13% year over year to $7.4 billion. The company also reported net income of $2.6 billion which equated to a per-share (diluted) profit of $2.05. And in the nine months leading up to that date the earnings per share (EPS) topped $4.63. That's easily enough to cover the current dividend which on an annual basis would total $2.84. And it leaves room for some generous increases as well.

Now may be an optimal time to buy Gilead stock. The company typically reports its fourth-quarter earnings in early February. Gilead could announce another dividend hike then as well. Since 2015 when the company began making dividend payments Gilead has consistently raised its payouts each subsequent year (and normally in February).

With solid financials and the company likely to continue receiving a boost from its COVID-19 treatment Veklury it's probable that this dividend could get even juicier than it already is today.

A cash cow with a stable dividend

Prosper Junior Bakiny (Pfizer): When it comes to dividend stocks high yields are great but the ability to sustain dividend increases is even better. That's what pharma giant Pfizer provides. The company's current yield of 2.75% is well above the S&P 500's average of 1.27%. But just as important is Pfizer's very conservative cash payout ratio of 29.64%. For context a payout ratio below the 60% range is generally considered good.

This implies that Pfizer has considerable room to sustain dividend increases in large part thanks to the cash it has been generating over the past year. Pfizer's free cash flow soared by 126.1% to $29.2 billion in the trailing twelve-month period. We can attribute that primarily to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty. This vaccine has become a blockbuster product -- and then some -- in its first year on the market.

Pfizer said it would generate $36 billion from Comirnaty in the fiscal year 2021. Given recent developments surrounding the pandemic 2022 should be another excellent year for the vaccine. Management thinks sales of Comirnaty could come in at $29 billion this year. Pfizer's coronavirus-related business alone which includes Comirnaty and Paxlovid a COVID-19 therapy that recently earned authorization will generate more sales than dozens of large corporations will this year.

But Pfizer has other tools at its disposal. The company's anticoagulant Eliquis cancer medicine Xtandi as well as its biosimilar business are meaningfully contributing to its overall performance. Even immunosuppressant Xeljanz could return to growth this year despite the regulatory headwinds it encountered last year.

Lastly Pfizer's pipeline includes 29 ongoing phase 3 clinical trials. Expect new products and label expansions to strengthen an already solid lineup.

And all of this at a reasonable price too. Pfizer is trading at just 9.1 times forward earnings compared to an average price-to-earnings ratio of 13.3 for the pharma industry.

In short Pfizer provides a little bit of everything most investors look for: high growth reasonable value and stable income in the form of dividends. Too juicy to pass up indeed.",,,,,,

Introduction

Ripple as a company predates the launch of Bitcoin having been formed in 2004 by software developer Ryan Fugger four years before Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper. However Ripple’s initial implementation was conventional whereby a centralized organization maintained a transaction ledger.

In 2013 Ripple finally launched the XRP Ledger (XRPL) borrowing the decentralized ledger concept from Bitcoin. It also borrowed the use of a native cryptocurrency that facilitates value transfer within the network. The Ripple team named the currency XRP.

This guide will explain why most crypto investors choose to buy XRP how you can join the fray and which platforms support buying selling as well as trading the asset.

Before going any further it’s worth pointing out that Ripple Labs Inc the company behind Ripple ran into regulatory headwinds in December 2020 when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against it.

The case has not yet been concluded as of yet. However Ripple’s lawyer is confident the SEC case will wrap in April 2022 and these developments might cause XRP to see a bullish narrative on price. Hence we will also discuss further in this article how this lawsuit has affected Ripple and by extension the viability of investing in XRP coins.

What is Ripple?

Ripple (the full company name is three constituent parts that comprise:



1. XRP blockchain ledger – an open-source public blockchain that is designed to process digital payments;

2. XRP cryptocurrency – the native digital asset that is used to transfer value within the XRP blockchain ledger;

3. Ripple – a money transfer network designed to enable cross-border payments (especially among banks) similar to how SWIFT works. (the full company name is Ripple Labs ) can be broken down intothat comprise:1.– an open-source public blockchain that is designed to process digital payments;– the native digital asset that is used to transfer value within the XRP blockchain ledger;– a money transfer network designed to enable cross-border payments (especially among banks) similar to how SWIFT works.

As a money transfer network Ripple controls three disparate parts that together form the Ripple Network (RippleNet): xCurrent xRapid and xVia.

xCurrent is Ripples global payment system that runs atop the InterLedger distributed ledger. You can think of xCurrent as Ripple’s answer to SWIFT the giant interbank messaging and funds transfer system. xCurrent functions independent of the XRP asset allowing the transfer of multiple currencies XRP being one of them. When XRP is sent through the InterLedger using xCurrent Ripple describes that as xRapid.

xRapid is a liquidity solution allowing transacting parties to transfer varying currencies (fiat and XRP) between each other. When the sender wants to transfer say USD to a receiver in Japan their funds will be converted into XRP coins sent across to a receiving institution in Japan where the counterparty will then receive the funds in the local currency (JPY) in less than five second.

xVia is a payment interface that is designed to offer RippleNet users a more intuitive user experience. It’s like using a banking app without having to understand how the backend works.

How Does the XRP Ledger Work?

When the XRP tokens are sent from one wallet to another they are transferred on the XRP ledger (XRPL) which is a blockchain network similar to Bitcoin in functionality. However unlike Bitcoin the XRPL does not use mining as a consensus mechanism.

The distributed ledger is managed by a group of independent pre-vetted transaction validators tasked with confirming debits and credits. Ripple calls this consensus mechanism the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol. It shares a lot with the increasingly popular proof of staking (PoS) mechanisms and in particular the Delegated PoS (dPoS) consensus mechanism.

All participating validators have to agree on a version of a ledger before it is permanently encoded to the blockchain but the process is extremely efficient in that it only takes about four seconds to create each ledger on the XRP blockchain.

Pros and Cons of Using XRP

XRP is a cryptocurrency built to facilitate payments. To that effect XRP users acquire some benefits and have to accept some network drawbacks if any. Here are some of the pros and cons associated with making payments using XRP and using Ripple for global payments.

Pros

Fast transaction settlement speeds – ledgers on the XRP blockchain are created every three to five seconds. Ripple claims that the XRP ledger can typically perform at 1500 transactions per second (TPS) with the capability of scaling up to 65000 TPS. In comparison Bitcoin and Ethereum’s settlement speeds are ~5 TPS and ~15 TPS respectively.

In comparison Bitcoin and Ethereum’s settlement speeds are ~5 TPS and ~15 TPS respectively. Distributed – the XRP Ledger is maintained by more than 150 independent entities including financial institutions universities and exchanges. These entities are distributed around the world. It’s worth noting that Ripple does control some nodes and according to the company that number is less than 10.

It’s worth noting that Ripple does control some nodes and according to the company that number is less than 10. Cost-effective – network fees on the XRP ledger can get as low as $0.0003. It is cheaper than using some of the other main blockchain networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum and it’s even cheaper than traditional payment services such as Western Union.

Growing adoption – Ripple’s RippleNet technology has been slowly gaining traction as more traditional financial institutions adopt it which gives it the stamp of approval and encourages other entities to adopt it. If Ripple becomes the preferred cross-border payment and settlement channel the perceived value of XRP is expected to grow.

Cons

Stiff competition – Ripple has opted to compete in the highly saturated financial payments fields against big players such as SWIFT. Even within the cryptocurrency scene it is facing stiff competition from blockchain projects such as Stellar (XLM). Also while competition may not be a bad thing it’s worth noting that Ripple only partially depends on XRP. It is possible that some of the other Ripple entities may succeed but not XRP the cryptocurrency.

It is possible that some of the other Ripple entities may succeed but not XRP the cryptocurrency. Regulatory uncertainty – Since December 2020 Ripple has been embroiled in a legal battle against the US SEC which claims that the company may have violated the US Securities and Exchange Act by selling XRP tokens in the domestic market. If Ripple loses this case the result could be detrimental to the existence of both Ripple the XRP Ledger and XRP.

Despite these drawbacks Ripple and XRP bring a lot to the financial payments space. As an investor you may find uses for XRP including speculation or using it as a channel for value transfer. If that’s the case read on to find out how to invest in XRP and start using Ripple.

How to buy Ripple’s XRP? (Step-by-Step)

There are five simple steps to buying XRP coins. They are:

Find a crypto exchange that supports buying and selling XRP; Create an account; Define an XRP investment strategy; Fund your crypto exchange account; Buy XRP.

Let’s consider each step in more detail.

Step 1 – Where to Buy XRP | Crypto exchanges that sell XRP

Despite XRP’s popular reputation within the cryptocurrency space it’s surprising that few US-based exchanges support it thanks to its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Immediately following the announcement from the SEC that it was going after Ripple and two of its executives most exchanges delisted XRP including Coinbase one of the largest crypto exchanges that prides itself in being compliant in several US states.

Even though XRP is undergoing a legal battle it is still legal to purchase in the US and in several other jurisdictions across the world. Plus there are still a number of credible crypto exchanges through which you can acquire some XRP. Here are four of the best crypto exchanges that currently support XRP trades.

In the United States:

Uphold is a New York-based multi-asset company with cryptocurrency as one of its supported products. There are more than seventy cryptocurrencies available for purchase on its platform and XRP is one of them. Below we highlight a step-by-step guide on how you can use Uphold to purchase your first XRP coins.

Kraken is among the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges in existence having been launched in 2013. The platform is based in San Francisco California and offers its crypto-related services across the world and in several states within the US. With Kraken you may not be able to trade XRP but you can buy the coin and send it off the platform.

The rest of the World:

Binance is the leading cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume with a global appeal. The worldwide version which happens to support XRP trades is not available to US-based residents. The version of Binance that is available to US residents has limited support for digital assets and XRP is not among the few cryptocurrencies on offer. If you have access to Binance.com you can buy sell trade store and lend XRP within the exchange.

KuCoin is a Singapore-based highly regulated crypto exchange with operations covering close to 200 countries. The exchange offers trading brokerage staking hot storage lending and early-stage project investment to its more than ten million users and one of its supported digital assets is XRP.

Note . For a comprehensive list of credible and class-leading digital asset trading platforms read our guide on the Best Cryptocurrency Trading Platforms

Step 2. Create an account

If this is your first time interacting with cryptocurrency assets you might want to create an account with your preferred choice of digital asset trading exchange. This step can be broken down into a few smaller stages that are:

Sign up – provide your email address name phone number username and password. Try to use a password generator to create a unique password which should help you secure your online trading account. Verify your identity – all centralized cryptocurrency exchanges now require their users to provide personally identifiable information for two reasons: to comply with global KYC (know your customer) regulations and to increase your account’s security. If you prefer not to provide your identity information you can opt to use decentralized exchanges (DEXes) but few of these support XRP trading.

Plus DEXes typically only support crypto-to-crypto trades meaning you have to use another asset to acquire XRP and you will have to buy it from a centralized platform anyway.

Most centralized platforms offer a tiered identity verification process where the more you transact the more ID details they will demand of you. For instance with Binance the minimum ID verification level involves just submitting your name providing your country of residence and date of birth.

The second tier involves uploading a copy of your identity document and performing the selfie test while the third and final stage involves the submission of proof of residence using documents such as bank statements or utility bills.

Once you are done with the account setup stage you are now ready to fund your account but before doing that you might want to first review your XRP investment strategy.

Step 3 – Plan your XRP investment strategy

An investment strategy is essential for every investor whether you are investing in precious metals stocks early-stage companies or even crypto. An investment plan helps you decide what you will buy how often and the quantity of that asset to buy.

Additionally you will also have to define your goals in order to know why you are investing in any particular asset and when you will exit your position. Effectively your investment strategy will include three things:

Your investment philosophy; Your investment goals; and Your investment particulars (which asset to buy when and why).

A typical example of an XRP buying plan is:

Goal : Double my investment

: Double my investment Asset : XRP

: XRP How much of asset to buy : $10000 worth of XRP

: $10000 worth of XRP Investment strategy : Dollar-cost averaging

: Dollar-cost averaging Duration of investment: 1 year or as soon as ROI is achieved (100% ROI)

Note Read more about investment strategies on our ‘ Cryptocurrency Trading for Beginners ’ guide where we highlight the various types of strategies ideal for a crypto investor.

Step 4 – Fund your online account

Different trading platforms will support various payment methods according to their user’s needs. One platform may allow its users to deposit and withdraw using a particular channel while another will not support that channel altogether.

Before choosing an ideal crypto trading exchange you need to consider which payment options they support and whether those options work for you. Most platforms however allow their users to make deposits or direct purchases using debit/credit cards. Other common payment methods are:

Bank transfers

Wire transfers

SEPA deposits

SWIFT transfers

Crypto deposits

Different funding channels attract varying transaction fees and payments settle after varying durations. Typically using credit/debit cards is the most expensive method but it’s also the fastest and most direct in that you do not have to deposit to your account but rather you can buy XRP directly. The funds from your account are deducted by the exchange which then deposits an equivalent amount of the desired asset in your account.

Bank transfers and SWIFT deposits are typically cheaper than most other options but they are also the slowest normally taking 3-5 business days to settle. Crypto deposits offer the right compromise between speed and cost and sometimes depending on the asset being deposited can be the cheapest and fastest route to funding your exchange account.

Step 5 – Buy XRP Coins

If you opted for the instant purchase using debit cards you are probably ready for the next step. However if you opted to transfer funds from your bank account you may have to wait a few days for the funds to reflect on your online account. Once they do proceed to the next step which is making the investment.

The various cryptocurrency exchanges will have different processes on how to purchase XRP and because of that we will give you an example step-by-step guide on how to buy XRP on Uphold. You may have to tinker a little bit with your favorite platform to figure out the process but once you have gone through the other steps outlined above buying should be simple.

How to Buy XRP on Uphold (Step-by-Step)

This section assumes that you are using Uphold and that you have created an account verified your identity and funded it. Otherwise you could opt to use the instant purchase feature of buying using a debit card.

1. Access your Uphold account.

Visit Uphold and sign in to your account using your username and password.

2. Provide transaction details.

Once you log in to Uphold you will only focus on the right-most column where the exchange has its transaction form.

If you are using the mobile app just tap on the transaction icon in the middle of the bottom navigation which should load the transaction wizard.

Click (or tap) the down arrow within the [From] field. This way you will specify to Uphold where you intend to source the funds to buy your XRP.

The exchange will load a list of available funding options including using a bank account credit card assets held within your Uphold account or even transferring crypto from an external wallet to Uphold.

Click on the [+] icon next to either bank or Credit Card to connect a bank account or credit/debit card respectively.

The box highlighted below the credit card box shows the available crypto networks from which you can transfer digital assets to Uphold. In our case we have already added a bank account so we will select that which will close the dialogue box.

Next click the [To] field to specify which asset you intend to purchase. Uphold will load up a list of available assets that you can buy. You can use the search box to search for XRP or click the [Cryptocurrencies] filter just below the search box then select XRP from the list.

Now that you have specified the asset you want to buy and your payment method. Fill in the amount to purchase on the middlebox with the fiat currency selected or by specifying how many XRP coins you wish to buy.

Whichever figure you provide Uphold will automatically convert and fill in the appropriate amount in the corresponding form field. If you provide the fiat amount you wish to spend the exchange will automatically fill in the amount of XRP coins you will get.

Click the [Preview Deposit] button to confirm your transaction.

3. Confirm and authorize the purchase.

The last step will involve you checking the transaction details and confirming that they are correct. In the confirmation screen Uphold will provide the purchase rate for each XRP and the terms of the sale. Read through each statement then click the [Confirm Deposit] button below.

Depending on the chosen deposit or funding method your XRP will be credited to your account immediately or after a predetermined period.

That is it! That is the simple process of buying XRP on Uphold exchange.

Final thoughts

Ripple is peddling an innovative technology and despite running into headwinds with the US SEC the company still continues to champion easier and more convenient ways to make international payments. As we have discussed in this guide Ripple’s XRP ledger and the XRP cryptocurrency offer several benefits to their users such as fast confirmation times cheap costs and eco-friendliness.

We had also outlined a simple step-by-step process to acquire XRP from Uphold one of the few exchanges that still allow its users to buy XRP. Most other exchanges offer a similar process to buy crypto but the details may vary. You can tinker with your chosen platform to figure out the process or contact the official customer support for help.

In 2021 the Dodgers' bullpen was very successful. Last season the group ranked second in MLB in team ERA. In 2021 Blake Treinen a hard-throwing righty was a key reason for the LA bullpen's dominance.

Baseball experts have noticed. Buster Olney of ESPN ranked Treinen as the fourth-best reliever in all of baseball.

“With his hard-veering sinker and nasty slider Treinen keeps the ball off the barrel of the bat. No relief pitcher generated a higher rate of soft contact last season than the right-hander.”

Treinen ranked eighth in strikeout rate (29.7%) and sixth in ground-ball rate (52.6%). Treinen also had the fourth-lowest hard-hit percentage (24.3%) of relievers who pitched at least 70 innings according to FanGraphs.

Treinen's numbers in those categories laid the groundwork for a fantastic 2021 season. In 72 outings he had a 1.99 ERA and 0.98 WHIP. By far his best season since 2018.

The Dodgers re-signed Treinen to a three-year $24M contract with a club option for 2023 last January.

Treinen represents yet another calculated gamble by the Dodgers that paid off. The Oakland A's released the 33-year-old after a dismal 2019 season. In 2018 Treinen was an All-Star and legitimate Cy Young candidate.

His 2018 stats were quite impressive.

Blake Treinen 2018 Stats

ERA: 0.78 (1st among RP with min. 70 IP)

WHIP: 0.83 (3rd)

K%: 31.7% (7th)

BB%: 6.7% (7th)

SV: 38 (2nd)

2019 was a disaster for Treinen. His ERA (4.91) and WHIP (1.61) sky-rocketed. He did not record a save after June 17th. Treinen also struggled with his control (5.68 BB/9) before ending the season on the IL due to a back injury.

The A's parted ways with their former shutdown stopper after his poor season.

The Dodgers saw an opportunity to add a potential high-quality bullpen and they took it.

Treinen will continue to be an important arm for the Dodgers this coming season.

According to Olney he's up there with the best of the best.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcmFuZ2Vycy8yMDIyLzAxLzE1L3NvdXJjZXMtcmFuZ2Vycy1hZ3JlZS10by1kZWFscy13aXRoLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtcHJvc3BlY3RzLWFudGhvbnktZ3V0aWVycmV6LWpvc2UtZGUtamVzdXMv0gGgAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9yYW5nZXJzLzIwMjIvMDEvMTUvc291cmNlcy1yYW5nZXJzLWFncmVlLXRvLWRlYWxzLXdpdGgtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1wcm9zcGVjdHMtYW50aG9ueS1ndXRpZXJyZXotam9zZS1kZS1qZXN1cy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rangers agree to deals with international prospects Anthony Gutierrez Jose de Jesus,"While everything involving major league players remains ground to a standstill due to the lockout the Rangers did agree to plunk down more than $3 million on a pair of Latin American teenagers as the international free agent signing period began Saturday.

Gutierrez 17 was the highest rated prospect among the deals. He was linked initially to the Washington Nationals but had switched over to the Rangers in the last few months.

We should have accessible care too,"Open this photo in gallery: Illustration by Gabrielle Drolet

Gabrielle Drolet is a journalist and cartoonist based in Toronto.

I spent most of my life feeling like I was barely getting by. No matter how much effort I put in I was always falling behind everything just beyond my control.

I couldn’t keep up with school readings. I handed in essays and articles with spelling mistakes having written them the day they were due. I felt friendships slip away and scrambled to reel them in answering texts or calling people back weeks late. Even everyday chores spiralled and accumulated a few dishes becoming a sinkful.

I struggled to keep up with what everyone else seemed to find easy my friends and peers breezing through the same small tasks that overwhelmed me.

My friends thought this was by choice. They joked that I was the biggest procrastinator they’d ever met or that I couldn’t be bothered to put in the effort. I spent years believing the same thing – that maybe if I tried harder something would click into place.

When I came across a thread about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) on Twitter a couple of years ago I felt stunned by how many of the symptoms related to my own experiences. Things I’d always attributed to laziness or bad habits – which ranged from being unfocused and disorganized to impulsive and easily frustrated – suddenly had a clear-cut explanation. With each symptom I read I felt my stomach sink.

Though ADHD aligned itself closely with my experiences I closed Twitter and tried not to think about it. Because of the stigmas surrounding the disorder I convinced myself it couldn’t be an option for me; that I was looking to excuse my own bad behaviour. I continued to scrape by even if barely.

Then about a year and a half ago things finally fell apart.

In September of 2020 I started a master’s degree online the pandemic confining me to a little apartment I shared with my then-girlfriend in Nova Scotia. The lines between school life and work became blurred everything happening in the same few rooms. Focusing became more difficult the sound of my partner’s Zoom meetings and conversations a constant distraction. Come October a lack of structure and routine proved detrimental: deadlines slipped past entirely; I lost touch with friends and family; I was in a constant state of anxiety unsure how to regain control. I reached my breaking point and it became clear I had a problem that ran deeper than procrastination.

Realizing I likely had ADHD was hard. What followed was much harder.

Symptoms can include restlessness low tolerance for frustration and trouble organizing tasks.PROFESSOR MARCO CATANI KING’S COLLEGE LONDON/Handout via Reuters

People often joke that the process of getting diagnosed is one of the most unkind things you can put an ADHD sufferer through. When a disorder is characterized by a difficulty self-managing and following through on tasks an assessment process that requires jumping through multiple hoops can feel too overwhelming. At the slightest inconvenience it feels easy to give up as I did for several months.

When it came to accessing treatment I wasn’t sure where to start. Most of the advice online was to talk to a family doctor but at the time I didn’t have one. (This meant a referral to a psychiatrist was a tall order too.) A series of dead-ends pushed me to call private psychology clinics in Halifax. One said an assessment would cost roughly $1600; another quoted $1400. Even if I could afford that (I couldn’t) diagnosis wouldn’t guarantee medication – only validation and maybe an action plan with next steps. Since psychologists aren’t able to write prescriptions I’d have to bring my assessment to a walk-in clinic and hope they’d take me seriously adding another step to an already difficult process.

These barriers felt insurmountable. In the months that followed I felt a constant mix of anger frustration and self-pity every time I struggled with a task. I knew what the problem was – I just didn’t have the resources to address it. It was crushing.

I wasn’t financially stable enough to book an appointment until three months later in January when I finally reached out to those private clinics again. It took until April to get diagnosed and May to get medicated.

I didn’t realize it at the time but my situation was far from unique – right down to when and how I realized I had ADHD. A U.K. paper published in August found that adults with ADHD had a harder time adapting to a locked-down life than others stating the pandemic “exacerbated the core symptoms of ADHD and co-occurring difficulties.”

As people lost access to the systems and coping mechanisms they relied on whether they be in-person workspaces or structured schedules symptoms became harder to ignore. Doron Almagor a psychiatrist who works at The Possibilities Clinic in Toronto – which diagnoses and treats ADHD in people of all ages – says he’s worked with many adults over the past year getting assessments specifically because of COVID. “They may have been able to cope with their ADHD symptoms prior to the pandemic” he says “but it’s kind of shifted the context of their life to such a point that they can’t cope.”

First Person: Improv helped me learn to live with ADHD On the stage I learned to be still yet engaged – and to concentrate carefully something my brain doesn’t usually want to do writes Kristen McLeod.

While the pandemic has acted as a catalyst for people to come to terms with having ADHD it seems to play a small part in a cultural shift that was already happening. As we talk more openly about mental health and disability particularly on social media it’s become easier for adults to learn about the disorder and realize they might have it too.

For many people Twitter or TikTok are the places where they first learned about adult ADHD and its nuances. On both platforms creators post resources information or stories about their own experiences with ADHD trying to spread more awareness of what it actually looks like in adults.

Though my lightbulb moment came from Twitter TikTok is especially interesting here. Content about ADHD is hugely popular there: videos using the hashtag “ADHD” have a combined 8.7 billion views and creators who talk about it have millions of followers. TikTok also has an impeccable algorithm – it’s great at picking up what you’re watching and sending more of it your way. Once I realized I might have ADHD TikTok kept recommending videos on the topic making the reality of my situation harder to ignore. Every time I opened the app I was faced with a new creator describing symptoms I didn’t even know were symptoms.

The video format feels more personal than a tweet too – seeing someone who looks like you describe experiences like yours can help you come to terms with the possibility of an undiagnosed condition. This visibility is valuable when it comes to dispelling stereotypes about what ADHD looks like which are abundant.

David Teplin a clinical psychologist whose areas of focus include adult ADHD and clinical assessment explains that many of us still associate ADHD with rambunctious energetic young boys. It’s a stereotype that’s been around for a long time strengthened by the history surrounding the disorder.

“ADHD has been described in medical writing since the 1700s so it’s not a new concept” Dr. Teplin says. “I think part of the confusion possibly misunderstanding is that ADHD up until 35 years ago roughly was seen really as a disorder of childhood in which people outgrew it.”

Of course anyone can have ADHD and it doesn’t always look like hyperactivity. However the stereotype has a tangible impact. Many of us have a hard time wrapping our heads around the fact that adults can have ADHD at all – especially those who appear outwardly professional and organized or who don’t look the way we expect someone with ADHD to look. White boys are diagnosed at higher rates than anyone else with people of colour and girls often getting left behind until adulthood.

Despite the cultural shift that seems to be happening – wherein our understanding of ADHD is moving away from old stereotypes – our health care system feels stagnant. Accessing treatment can be a confusing outdated process and ironically arduous for those who have trouble following through on things.

“It’s not uncommon that somebody calls me and says ‘Doc I’ve been meaning to call you for two years. I just didn’t get around to it’ ” Dr. Teplin says.

In Canada there are several routes through which someone can acquire an ADHD diagnosis and/or a prescription. In some cases family doctors who are well-versed in developmental disabilities and who are comfortable assessing ADHD will directly prescribe to their patients. Others might refer a patient to a psychiatrist – specialized physicians who are funded by provincial health care but for whom there is generally a long wait list.

While general practitioners are the most logical first step family doctor shortages are a common problem across the country. This is deeply felt in parts of Atlantic Canada with people often waiting upwards of six months to see a GP or nurse practitioner.

Wait times to see psychiatrists are so long they often push patients to pay out-of-pocket for private clinics. Dr. Teplin says he hears from people who weren’t looking to see a psychologist but end up reaching out because otherwise they’d have to wait anywhere from six months to a year for publicly funded treatment.

Long wait times aren’t the only barrier to care. Because of those stereotypes mentioned earlier health care practitioners can hold outdated beliefs with clear effects on their patients – particularly those who aren’t men. I spoke to patients who reported being dismissed by their physicians when bringing up ADHD at appointments their practitioners not even entertaining it as an option. While some were told they couldn’t have ADHD because they’re too successful or good in school others were diagnosed with other problems entirely.

It’s not uncommon to be diagnosed with depression or anxiety in place of ADHD an issue exacerbated by the fact that anxiety and depression often coexist alongside ADHD in women.

“When you take family physicians who are trained in anxiety [and] depression [but] are not trained in ADHD they will naturally misdiagnose or only diagnose the anxiety and depression and not the ADHD” says Heidi Bernhardt the director of education and advocacy for the Centre for ADHD Awareness Canada (CADDAC). “So we end up with women who were treated for those disorders unsuccessfully sometimes for decades before we diagnose ADHD.”

Even in situations where people have well-meaning family doctors diagnosis can still be hard to access based on the resources available in a geographic area. Oksana Preachuk a recent university graduate living in a small Manitoban municipality has been actively trying to get assessed or treated since August 2020.

She started by turning to her family doctor who was supportive but didn’t feel comfortable prescribing anything. She then tried turning to psychiatrists cold-calling clinics but never able to book in for an appointment. From there she reached out to a nurse practitioner and a mental health institution in nearby Winnipeg but she was too far outside of the catchment area – meaning based on where she lives she doesn’t qualify for treatment in the city but in a small municipality there’s nowhere for her to turn.

“I’m not sure where to really go from here. I almost feel like I’ve exhausted all my options but at the same time I don’t know what all of my options are” Ms. Preachuk says.

For now going to a private clinic doesn’t seem like an option. As a young adult without good health insurance Ms. Preachuk can’t afford to pay out-of-pocket for an assessment and doesn’t know when she will be able to.

“It’s certainly disheartening to go to a bunch of different people who are supposed to be able to help you and who say that they’re here to help you but then have it go nowhere” Ms. Preachuk says.

Of course for some the health care system works the way it should: They’re treated appropriately by their GPs easily referred to psychiatrists or able to comfortably afford care from psychologists. In some cases being a student can also ease the process with university health services providing assessments. However the system shouldn’t be so hard to navigate that some adults stay undiagnosed for months or years.

First Person: I need more people with ADHD in my life My neurodivergent husband and his family constantly teach me how to adapt to life’s various surprises writes Brittany Penner.

While diagnosis isn’t a cure-all for people with ADHD it has clear positive effects. ADHD commonly coexists with other mental problems and can even cause or exacerbate them. Studies have shown that untreated ADHD can worsen comorbid disorders while diagnosis and treatment can curb them. As an example early treatment and medication for young people with ADHD has been proven to reduce substance use disorder rates later in life which is vital: studies show that 23 per cent of young adults with substance use disorders also present ADHD symptoms.

Formal diagnosis is important for another reason: it’s often the key to using accessibility services in schools and workplaces. These services can range from extra time on exams to accessible technology or quiet places to work in an office. Writer and producer Dev Ramsawakh who was able to get medication and treatment through their family doctor never got formally diagnosed which barred them from certain services at the University of Toronto.

“The school did actually need me to get a diagnosis of some kind in order to access some of the more technological accommodations” Mx. Ramsawakh said. “I pretty much never really pursued the official diagnosis because of the cost it would take.”

The benefits of being diagnosed can be as simple as feeling validated too. When my psychologist finally told me I had ADHD – six months and $1400 after I’d first looked into getting diagnosed – I was flooded with a mix of vindication and relief. I apologized for crying on the Zoom call overwhelmed with emotion and my psychologist waved a pixelated hand through the air.

“This happens all the time” she said.

I had spent years blaming myself for my difficulties with work school and even everyday tasks; years thinking I was a bad student a lazy journalist a poor friend. Having an explanation and a way forward meant everything.

Treatment can look different for everyone. For me it’s a stimulant in the morning and a series of coping strategies I use throughout the workday: to-do lists schedules timers. I’m also working on being kinder to myself more patient and understanding when I’m struggling more than my peers.

I’m sure there were other less pricey ways for me to get diagnosed but I was at a point where I couldn’t wait any longer. I’m lucky I was able to pay out-of-pocket but that’s not a reality for everyone – and money shouldn’t be a barrier nor should geography or anything else.

As more adults realize they might have ADHD we need better systems in place for accessible treatment. Our culture is slowly shifting toward more understanding and compassion for people with ADHD – our medical care should reflect that.

ADHD isn’t what you think. It is what I live with

Cho was one of 12 new international signings by the club. Newsis



South Korean high school baseball prospect Cho Won-bin has inked a deal with the St. Louis Cardinals months after pulling out of the domestic league draft in pursuit of his American dream.



Cho was one of 12 international free agent signings announced by the Cardinals Saturday (local time) and is the first Asian amateur to sign with the team.



Cho set to graduate from Seoul Convention High School had been regarded as a strong candidate to be selected during the territorial portion of the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) draft last summer.



In the territorial draft the 10 KBO clubs get to pick an amateur player based in their region while another free-for-all draft is set to follow later in the year.



However Cho withdrew himself from draft consideration so he would be able to land a deal with a Major League club.



By pulling out of the KBO draft Cho is ineligible for the draft here for the next two years per league rules.



Cho batted .367/.519/.550 in 18 games in 2021 with two homers and 12 RBIs. In 2020 he put up a .357/.458/.614 line with three homers and 17 RBIs in 19 games.



Cho had been drawing interest from Major League clubs since winning the home run derby for the underclass players at the National Power Showcase in November 2020 at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas. Cho also had a showcase before big league scouts last year.



The Cardinals are no strangers to South Korean players. They had a South Korean-born closer Oh Seung-hwan from 2016 to 2017. Former KBO MVP-winning left-hander Kim Kwang-hyun pitched for the Cards from 2020 to 2021 and is now a free agent.



In 2009 KBO veteran Choi Hyang-nam drew a $101 bid from the Cardinals in posting though Choi never suited up for the team. (Yonhap)

GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnZlc3Rpbmctc3RvY2tzLWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtY2FwZS1yYXRpby0xMzU4NTMwNTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investing: Goldman Sachs destroys one of the most persistent myths about stocks,"A version of this post was originally published on TKer.co.

Let’s talk about the CAPE ratio. It’s one of the most widely-followed stock market valuation and investing metrics. It’s being talked about more as investors wonder whether stocks are poised to lose ground in 2022. Unfortunately the signal of doom it supposedly sends is a myth.

CAPE or cyclically adjusted price-earnings was popularized by Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller. It’s calculated by taking the price of the S&P 500 and dividing it by the average of 10 years’ worth of earnings. When CAPE is above its long-term average the stock market is thought to be expensive.

Many market watchers use above-average CAPE readings as a signal that stocks should underperform or even fall as it reverts back to its long-term mean.

But CAPE’s mean doesn’t actually have much pull.

“While valuations feature importantly in our toolbox to estimate forward equity returns we should dispel an oft-repeated myth that equity valuations are mean-reverting” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a new note to clients.

The analysts began their discussion by noting that the problematic assumption that a mean exists for metrics like CAPE to revert to.

“Mean reversion assumes that market valuation metrics … are stationary and their long-term means do not change” they wrote.

In recent decades valuation metrics have been persistently high which have actually forced these long-term means to move higher. Not long ago GMO’s Jeremy Grantham made this observation to argue that valuations were in a “new normal” at elevated levels.

‘We have not found any statistical evidence of mean reversion’

At any rate the case for mean-reversion is weak.

“We have not found any statistical evidence of mean reversion” the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. “Equity valuations are a bounded time series: there is some upper bound since valuations cannot reach infinity and there is a lower bound since valuations cannot go below zero. However having upper and lower bounds does not imply valuations are stationary and revert to the same long-term mean.”

The Goldman analysts did the math and the key metric to look at in the chart below is the statistical significance.

“The statistical significance over the full sample is 26%. This means that there is only 26% confidence that the Shiller CAPE is mean-reverting and 74% confidence that it is not. The traditional threshold to consider a relationship statistically significant is 95%.”

(Chart: Goldman Sachs)

In other words you can’t rely on CAPE to gravitate toward any mean.

The Goldman analysts however weren’t done busting the myth and took issue with the concept of the CAPE ratio in general.

Story continues

“Even if we ignored this threshold the time between valuations crossing into their 10th decile and reverting to their long-term average is beyond a reasonable investment horizon for a tactical decision” they said. “For example the Shiller CAPE entered its 10th decile in August 1989 but did not revert to its long-term mean for 13 years.“

In other words trading based on the assumption CAPE will mean-revert could lead to indeterminate years of getting smoked by the market.

It’s worth repeating

There’s not much new here. The Goldman analysts have addressed this myth in reports published in 2013 2014 2018 and 2019.

They note that this isn’t just a CAPE-specific issue but an issue with many valuation metrics including valuation metrics applied to non-US stock markets.

I’ve flagged this problem recently here and here. I’ve written about it at Yahoo Finance here and at Business Insider here and here.

Prominent folks have been sounding off on CAPE issues for years including veteran Wall Street strategist Sean Darby finance professor Jeremy Siegel legendary investors Warren Buffett and blogger extraordinaire Michael Batnick.

Even Shiller himself has warned about CAPE’s reliability.

Still a simple Google search for “CAPE ratio” will return years of articles about how the market is about to crash. As you can see it’s being talked about now as stocks have had a bumpy ride to start the year.

The big picture

“We want to emphasize that valuations alone are not sufficient measures for underweighting equities” the Goldman analysts wrote. “High valuations do not reach some magical target and then revert to some stable mean; furthermore the time period for valuations to reach some long-term average is highly variable and therefore uncertain.”

Valuation metrics like CAPE and forward P/E aren’t totally worthless. By definition they offer a simple way of estimating the premium an investor pays for a company’s earnings.

However they simply don’t do a great job of telling you what stock prices will do in the coming days months or even years.

Dynavax Technologies California-based biotechnology firm Dynavax Technologies is one such stock. Goldman's analyst Madhu Kumar reinstated the stock to ""buy"" in a research note on Jan. 5 as he noted the ""considerable"" potential revenue stream from the company's Covid-19 vaccine adjuvant — an ingredient used in vaccines to create a stronger immune response. Over the longer term the bank is ""bullish"" on the company's hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine Heplisav-B which it believes has a potential to be ""best-in-class."" A recent recommendation by the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention for universal HBV vaccination in the U.S. could lead to a a 50% expansion of the virus vaccine market Kumar said. The bank forecasts sales of the company's Covid-19 adjuvant t o hit $517.5 million this year while Heplisav-B is expected to generate revenues of $536.1 million by 2030 Kumar said in the company's initiation note on Aug. 5. Goldman has a price target of $38 on the stock which closed at around $13 on Jan. 13 — an implied potential upside of 191%. Nerdy The bank also likes live online learning platform Nerdy . The company provides both paid and free classes in the U.S via its online platform — a market which Goldman expects to be valued at $69 billon by 2026. Analyst Eric Sheridan said in his initiation note on Jan. 6 that Covid-19 had accelerated the shift from offline to online learning which he expects will benefit Nerdy in the longer-term. Goldman has forecast revenue growth of 30% for the company into 2026 when it is expected to hit $519 million. The bank's price target of $8 on the stock implies a potential upside of 91% to its closing price of $4.20 on Jan. 13. Planet Labs Goldman initiated coverage on U.S. satellite imaging company Planet Labs i n January describing the company as a ""market leader"" which has a ""massive"" opportunity in selling its data analytics products. The company has ""first mover advantage in a 'game changing'' sector where commercial applications are in 'nascent' stages but where many new customers may find ""substantial value"" analyst Noah Poponak said in his initiation note on Jan. 12. The company has a scalable model which should also lead to higher profitability Poponak said with ""sustainable"" margins of more than 30% once scale has been reached. Goldman has a price target of $11 on the stock implying a potential upside of 97% to its closing price of around $5.60 on Jan. 13. Beigene The bank also favors Chinese biotechnology firm Beigene  initiating coverage on Jan. 11— shortly after its listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Analyst Ziyi Chen said the company is building a global cancer treatment franchise with one of the largest oncology teams in the world and extensive global clinical trials. Chen also noted its ""transformational collaborations"" with Amgen and Novartis . The analyst highlighted the company's ""solid"" cash position which will stand it in good stead as funding potentially slows in the biotech sector. Goldman has ascribed a price target of 276.1 Chinese yuan ($43.50) on the stock representing a 105% potential upside to its closing price of around 135 Chinese yuan on Jan. 13. Asychem Goldman commenced coverage of Tianjin-based pharmaceutical company Asychem on Jan. 13 calling it ""well positioned"" to capture the growing trend of drug development and manufacturing services (CDMO) being outsourced to China. Analyst Lizheng Zhu said the company's focus on research and development had led to its leadership within the CDMO space while the company also has a ""well-recognized"" reputation. Asychem also has strong customer retention and is gaining traction in attracting new client segments Zhu added.

The Chinese government’s unwavering insistence on stamping out any trace of the coronavirus is facing its biggest test yet as authorities grapple with Omicron’s quickening spread. And it could cost the world’s second largest economy dearly this year.

The Covid-19 variant has been cropping up across China in recent days including in major port cities like Dalian and Tianjin prompting restrictions that could upend business operations in those places. The rest of the world is also dealing with Omicron but China is different because of how intent authorities are on preventing any widespread outbreak by locking down cities and curbing travel.

The strict approach has so far been effective: China has recorded far fewer Covid-19 cases than many other nations during the pandemic and its economy was the only major one to grow in 2020.

Omicron though threatens to expose some serious flaws in that plan. The variant is much more transmissible than others making it difficult to contain. And as the rest of the world learns to live with the virus economists say China’s zero-tolerance strategy is likely to do more bad then good in 2022.

Goldman Sachs for example has just slashed its projection for Chinese economic growth in 2022 to 4.3% from 4.8%. That’s roughly half last year’s growth rate.

Those revisions come “in light of the latest Covid developments — in particular the likely higher average level of restriction (and thus economic cost) to contain the more infectious Omicron variant” Goldman analysts wrote in a research note Tuesday.

Morgan Stanley is taking a similar view that Omicron could mean the costs of a zero-Covid approach outweigh the benefits. Last week its analysts forecast growth of 4.9% in the first quarter but suspect it could slow to 4.2% “should Omicron spread to other regions and lead to multiple city-wide lockdowns.”

The analysts cited a “deeper disruption to services” as a top risk for China if the country extends containment measures to several cities. That would mark China’s most severe and widespread attempt to contain the coronavirus since April 2020 when it lifted its massive lockdown on Wuhan the original epicenter of the virus.

Threats to supply chains

Along with the country’s precarious services sector which is already struggling because of sporadic Covid outbreaks and antivirus measures Omicron could deal a blow to factories and supply chains compounding the economic threat.

An outbreak of the older Delta variant forced the industrial hub of Xi’an into lockdown earlier this year affecting production lines of global chip makers like Samsung and Micron.

And then there are the Omicron cases detected in major port cities. Ship congestion at Chinese ports has worsened recently as more cities implement strict Covid restrictions because of the outbreaks or as they tighten testing policies ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday season starting January 31.

The Shekou terminal in Shenzhen for example has begun restricting truckers bringing in loaded containers. Starting Friday truckers can only enter the terminal if they have bookings for export-bound containers on vessels arriving within three days the operator said in a statement this week.

The restrictions echo those from last year when several Chinese ports briefly shut down after infections were found amount dock workers. Those issues created backlogs of containers waiting to leave and ships waiting to dock — and added to the pressure on strained global supply chains.

So far there doesn’t appear to have been a lasting impact on trade. Customs data released Friday showed that exports jumped 21% in December from a year ago exceeding expectations. The country’s trade surplus was $676 billion in 2021 an all-time high.

That indicates that China’s strategy might actually be helping: Export orders may have shifted to China from other developing countries because of the “Omicron damage to the global supply chain” according to Zhiwei Zhang chief economist for Pinpoint Asset Management.

Even so there are risks — especially if China imposes a nationwide lockdown.

“Although China’s latest virus wave doesn’t appear to have dented exports much in December media reports point to growing virus-linked congestion and delays at a number of major Chinese ports since the start of the year” wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard senior China economist for Capital Economics in a Friday research note. “With cases popping up in even more port cities in recent days including Dalian and Shanghai the situation is likely to worsen in the near-term pulling down shipments this month.”

Staying the course at a price

China isn’t likely to let up on its zero-Covid approach for a while. One reason: the country’s Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine isn’t as effective as others against the variant according to recent reports.

“The population has virtually no antibodies against Omicron” wrote executives at Eurasia Group in a report published earlier this month. “Keeping the country locked down for two years has now made it more risky to open it back up.”

Along with concerns about the health of its population a handful of significant upcoming events will likely persuade Beijing to stay the course.

The country hosts the 2022 Winter Olympics in February making the containment of Omicron important in the near term. Chinese President Xi Jinping is also widely expected to seek a historic third term in office when the Chinese Communist Party holds its 20th Party Congress in the second half of this year underscoring the need for stability in the meantime.

Still the economic cost of containing an aggressive variant could be great. Analysts at Nomura wrote this week that retail sales and other services could take a big hit if there are more lockdowns adding that the benefits of zero-Covid are “likely diminishing while costs are rising.” They forecast GDP growth of 2.9% for the first quarter and 4.3% for the entirety of 2022.

Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer and chairman Cliff Kupchan meanwhile labeled the failure of China’s zero-Covid policy as the top global geopolitical risk for 2022 suggesting that a breakdown could lead to larger outbreaks more severe lockdowns and greater economic disruption.

“It’s the opposite of where Xi Jinping wants his country to be in the run-up to his third term but there’s nothing he can do about it” they wrote in their forecast this month. “The initial success of zero Covid and Xi’s personal attachment to it makes it impossible to change course.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8xNi93YXJlaG91c2Utcm9ib3RpY3Mtc3lzdGVtLWV4b3RlYy1yYWlzZXMtMzM1LW1pbGxpb24v0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzE2L3dhcmVob3VzZS1yb2JvdGljcy1zeXN0ZW0tZXhvdGVjLXJhaXNlcy0zMzUtbWlsbGlvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warehouse robotics system Exotec raises $335 million,"French startup Exotec has raised a $335 million Series D round in a new round of funding led by Goldman Sachs’ Growth Equity business. Following today’s investment the company has reached a valuation of $2 billion.

Exotec sells a complete end-to-end solution to turn a regular warehouse into a partially automated logistics platform. It’s a hardware and software solution that replaces some human tasks.

83North and Dell Technologies Capital also participated in the funding round. Previous Exotec investors include Bpifrance Iris Capital 360 Capital Partners and Breega. Some of them such as Breega Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund and Iris Capital invested once again.

The key component of the Exotec system is called the Skypods. These low-profile robots roam the floor autonomously. When they’re next to the right rack they can go up the rack to pick up a bin and then go down with the right bin. This is particularly useful to increase the storage density of a warehouse as you can store products a few meters above ground.

The Skypod then caries the bin to a picking station so that human operators can pick up the right product in the bin. The robot can then go back to the racks and put back the bin on a shelf.

In that scenario humans don’t have to roam the warehouse anymore. They can focus on picking packing and making sure products go in and out of the warehouse. When it comes to adding new products new shelves and new Skypods Exotec tries to be as flexible as possible.

If you want to add new racks you can expand your infrastructure without starting from scratch again. Similarly Exotec lets you add more Skypods in the system. And when you receive a delivery of products Exotec relies once again on its Skypods to store products in the fulfillment center.

From Skypods to Skypickers

With its standardized bin system Exotec can store several products in a single bin. There might be 18 products in that bin but customers want one two or three products in that bin — most likely they don’t want the entire bin. That’s why Exotec can’t simply empty small bins in a bigger bin to put together an order.

The startup has created new robots to remove humans from one more step of the ordering process. Exotec customers can now use Skypickers to automatically pick goods from an inventory bin and put them in a ready-to-ship bin.

This is what it looks like:

“Following the most significant supply chain disruptions of the modern era there’s only room left for innovation” co-founder and CEO Romain Moulin said in a statement. “While the entire logistics sector is fraught with uncertainty one of the most prevalent challenges is ongoing labor shortages. Exotec pioneers a new path: elegant collaboration between human and robot workers that delivers warehouse productivity in a lasting far more sustainable way.”

Exotec has always positioned its product as a service that can’t replace humans altogether. An Exotec warehouse is run by a combination of humans and robots. With the Skypickers though the startup is positioning itself as a logistics advantage in a tight labor market.

Following today’s funding round the startup plans to hire 500 engineers by 2025 and continue its push in North America. It has recently signed eight large customers in the region such as Gap and Geodis. Decathlon is also using Exotec in its Montreal fulfillment center.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAxLTE1L2V2ZW4tYWZ0ZXItYmlnLXByaWNlLWN1dHMtdGhlc2UtdGVjaC1zdG9ja3MtYXJlLW5vLWJhcmdhaW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Even After Big Price Cuts These Tech Stocks Are No Bargains,"Why did this happen?

The Government Denied Responsibility.,"To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times download Audm for iPhone or Android.

The soldiers with inexplicable breathing complaints started appearing in Dr. Robert F. Miller’s pulmonology clinic in 2004 the year after Baghdad fell to invading United States forces. These new patients were active-duty troops from nearby Fort Campbell men and women who came home from war with mysterious respiratory ailments. The base asked Miller an unassuming and soft-spoken lung specialist at Vanderbilt University to take a look.

Miller was baffled to see formerly healthy soldiers gasping for air after mild exertion. Some of them had been close to the fire at the Mishraq sulfur mine outside Mosul thought to be the largest release of sulfur dioxide ever caused by humans. But others had never gone anywhere near the burning mine. Some of them could no longer run or climb stairs and yet their X-rays and pulmonary-function tests looked normal.

Confounded Miller decided to try something radical: He began ordering lung biopsies under general anesthesia to look for more subtle damage known as small-airways disease. Sure enough the tissue revealed toxic lung injury which Miller diagnosed as constrictive bronchiolitis. To the doctor this meant two things: First the soldiers were not exaggerating their symptoms. And more important noninvasive screenings couldn’t be trusted to detect these new post-deployment ailments.

Eager to share his discovery Miller contacted doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. This led at first to what Miller recalls as an enthusiastic collaboration. Army doctors flew to Tennessee to review Miller’s biopsies and together they went to Fort Campbell to develop a protocol for evaluating patients.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHltZW1waGlhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yNjUxMS93aGl0ZS1zdGF0aW9uLWFybGluZ3Rvbi1naXJscy13aW4taW4tYmFydGxldHTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saturday prep report: White Station Arlington pick up wins in Bartlett girls showcase,"Enter your e-mail address

HIG,Hartford,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyYW50LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzE2L2hhcnRmb3JkLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtaGFzLWV4cGFuZGVkLWFjcm9zcy1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1idXQtYW50aS1jb21wZXRpdGl2ZS1sYXdzdWl0LXNlZW1zLXByZXR0eS1ub3ZlbC1hbmFseXN0LXNheXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hartford HealthCare has expanded across Connecticut but anti-competitive lawsuit 'seems pretty novel' analyst says,"Over the last decade Hartford Healthcare has transformed itself growing into a massive statewide health system employing 33000 people as it acquired medical practices and hospitals across Connecticut.

It acquired the Hospital of Central Connecticut in New Britain in 2011 Backus Hospital in Norwich in 2013 and Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington in 2018. In 2019 it acquired St. Vincent’s Medical Center in Bridgeport challenging Yale New Haven Health System in southwest Connecticut. In recent years Hartford HealthCare also added the Southington Surgery Center other Hartford and Waterford surgery centers as well as Middlesex Cardiology and Soundview Medical Associates.

This impressive growth has made Hartford Healthcare a leading health care system in the state. But to St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center — the other major hospital in Hartford — this is monopolistic expansion that could limit consumer choice and drive up prices.

Last week St. Francis sued Hartford Healthcare in U.S. District Court in New Haven accusing its larger rival of jeopardizing competition and limiting consumer choice. It’s seeking unspecified damages and an order prohibiting Hartford HealthCare from continuing its acquisitions.

“Hartford HealthCare’s anti-competitive actions were taken not to compete but specifically to increase its market dominance and ability to charge higher than market rates” St. Francis claims in its lawsuit. “It seeks to do so in significant part by seeking to foreclose the opportunities to compete for patients by other hospitals in Hartford County including its most significant competitor St. Francis.”

Dr. John Rodis and other hospital employees from St. Francis Hospital wave red hearts as a parade of first responders passes the hospital to pay tribute to the health care providers in 2020.

Consumers could face higher costs. One study cited by Kaiser Family Foundation that analyzed highly concentrated hospital markets in California found that an increase in the share of physicians in practices owned by a hospital was associated with a 12% increase in premiums for private plans.

Another study that used private insurer data found an increase in physician-hospital integration was associated with an average price increase of 14% for the same service.

Frances Padilla president of the Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut an advocacy group said Hartford HealthCare is “particularly aggressive” in broadening market share through acquisitions and can raise prices as it reduces competition. Cardiac and orthopedic surgeries – knee and hip replacements for example — are particularly high-margin practices she said.

Access too is affected as Hartford HealthCare frequently requires patients in eastern Connecticut to seek service in Hartford Padilla said.

Recruiting the ‘greatest experts’

Jeffrey Flaks chief executive officer of Hartford HealthCare said the lawsuit is “without merit and we will defend against this legal action in the courts. That will be the proper place to respond.”

Hartford HealthCare is improving access and affordability and recruits the “greatest experts to be our colleagues” he said in a message to Hartford HealthCare employees.

‘Market share’

Spencer Perlman managing partner and director of health care research at Veda Partners in Washington D.C. said a health care anti-competitive lawsuit “seems pretty novel” even as hospitals snap up physician practices in what he said is a common practice to drive up revenue with patient referrals.

Hospitals “battle for market share all the time and it can definitely get ugly” he said.

He cited a recently settled eight-year battle between the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Highmark a health care company over accusations Highmark steered thousands of patients to its network.

Another lucrative reason to acquire physician practices is to take advantage of higher Medicare reimbursements available to “satellite outpatient” departments he said. Previously physician practices they are now rebranded to capture more government money Perlman said.

However administrative and legislative changes are bringing Medicare reimbursement at hospital outpatient departments in line with what’s paid at physicians’ offices Perlman said.

Siphoning off physicians to a dominant health care network that often has “brand recognition” also is successful as it attracts more patients he said.

Ted Doolittle Connecticut’s health care advocate said hospitals infrequently sue each other making the St. Francis lawsuit surprising. But the issue of industry acquisitions is not new.

Charles Muro celebrates being inoculated by Nurse Karen Pagliaro at Hartford Healthcare’s mass vaccination center at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford on May 13 2021.

“Both competitors and people are getting gobbled up” he said.

In its lawsuit St. Francis Hospital says Hartford HealthCare brought in two dozen surgeons and specialists in hematology oncology cardiology and neurology over the last four years. Another nine specialists and primary care physicians have been recruited to work exclusively in a Hartford HealthCare physician hospital network it says.

St. Francis says Hartford HealthCare has acquired the practices of more than 50 physicians established control over doctor referrals and insists on exclusive access to medical equipment.

“These actions do not involve competition to attract patients based on price and quality” St. Francis said in the suit. “Instead they prevent such competition by controlling large numbers of physicians and effectively locking up referrals of their patients.”

Monopoly claim

In its lawsuit St. Francis accuses Hartford HealthCare of bullying physician practices to establish a monopoly. In one case it told physicians that if they balked at joining its health care system it would “crush” them St. Francis claims. And it accused Hartford HealthCare of increasing its market share as it reduced volume at Bristol Hospital.

A spokesman said Bristol Hospital is not a party to the lawsuit and will not comment.

Lisa Freeman executive director of the Connecticut Center for Patient Safety a nonprofit group that speaks for patients said the merits of the lawsuit have yet to be decided and no one knows “whose truth bears out.”

Still a concern is that health care is “turning into business decisions” she said. Surveys show that trust is a key consideration among patients and her advice is to check physician referrals.

The Lighthouse Surgery Center at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center focuses on outpatient orthopedic surgery.

With 33000 employees and operating revenue of $4.9 billion Hartford HealthCare dwarfs Trinity Health of New England the parent company of St. Francis and four other hospitals in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Trinity posted revenue of about $2 billion and employs about 11000 workers.

Hartford HealthCare also outstrips Yale New Haven Health another dominant hospital system in the state. It includes Bridgeport Hospital Greenwich Hospital Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London Yale New Haven Hospital Westerly Hospital in Rhode Island and a physician foundation.

Yale New Haven Health posted revenue of $4.6 billion and employs more than 26000 workers and 6685 medical staff.

State steps in with a study

Legislation enacted last year by the General Assembly and Gov. Ned Lamont directs the Office of Health Strategy to study ways to improve oversight and regulation of physician practice mergers and acquisitions.

The study included in broader legislation related to hospital billing and collections will review laws regulations and transactions of physician practices. The study which must be completed by Feb. 1 2023 will look at ways to ensure the viability of physician practices and develop legislative recommendations to improve reporting and oversight of physician practice mergers and acquisitions.

State Rep. Jonathan Steinberg House chairman of the public health committee said lawmakers responded to a trend that private equity firms are acquiring physician practices. “As with other industries it’s often about cost-cutting and not about delivering quality service” he said.

Steinberg a Westport Democrat said the acquisitions of physician groups is “hardly a new phenomenon.” Research published in February 2020 by the Journal of the American Medical Association said physician practice acquisitions by private equity firms increased to 136 in 2016 up from 59 in 2013.

Questions now focus on whether the change in ownership of physician practices has reached a tipping point is anti-competitive and where government fits in when interfering in market forces Steinberg said.

The trend he said is “in some ways a natural outgrowth of what we’re doing in managed care.”

HARTFORD Conn. — A vacant building in Hartford could become a museum honoring Connecticut's Black Civil War regiment. An Army veteran is spearheading a project to raise $35 million to tell the story of the 29th Regiment Connecticut Infantry the first Union soldiers to enter the defeated city of Richmond.

The city-owned building the former McCook Hospital also would be converted into subsidized housing for low-income veterans. Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal has offered to help the group with the federal funding process.

City officials say a thorough environmental assessment must be performed before the project can go forward.

While it was a working hospital McCook was one of the closest to the scene of the Hartford Circus fire in July 1944. Many of the injured were taken to McCook that day.

Submitted

During a season of transitions at First Church West Hartford the excitement of the moment is that the town’s 309-year-old Congregational church has called Rev. Jane Willan as its 21st Senior Pastor.

“In its more than 300-year history First Church has seen lots of change and growth: five different meeting houses 20 pastors and several interim leaders but never a female in the settled senior pastor position! We are very excited for this change and we believe West Hartford is ready” commented current church moderator Eleanor Wight.

Rev. Willan delivered a “Candidating Sermon” at First Church on Jan. 9 2022. Following worship church members filled in ballots at a Congregational meeting. 105 voted unanimously to extend the call to Rev. Willan. She will begin serving in her new role on Feb. 8 2022.

The steps

In May 2020 First Church assembled a Senior Pastor Search Committee of nine volunteers following the retirement of Rev. Dr. C. Geordie Campbell in January. Despite being the beginning of the pandemic there was important work to do and the committee proceeded adapting their activities to comply with Covid protocols.

Under the guidance of interim Senior Pastor Rev. Erica Avena Acting Associate Pastor Rev. Amie Giguere Director of Worship Arts Jim Boratko John P. Webster Library Director Jennifer deSimas Bridge Pastor Rev. Dr. Michael Newheart and others the church continued to offer worship support and programming though YouTube phone emails and Zoom. Meanwhile the Search Committee began its work of updating the church profile.

“Due to the pandemic our Search process was unlike any other. Our meetings and initial interviews were held entirely on Zoom” commented chairperson Suzanne Carnes. “We also visited other churches virtually to listen to sermons of potential candidates. Only finalists were scheduled for in-person interviews.”

The Search Committee first became acquainted with Rev. Willan at the end of September 2021 after they received her Ministerial Profile. Her profile was the 15th one they reviewed and stood out for several reasons. Rev. Willan shared her passion for social justice. She was among the first to officiate same sex marriages in Iowa. She also committed to “effective and dynamic stewardship” and has developed and sharpened her own skills in this area.

Rev. Willan serves the wider church as a board member of the Central Massachusetts Association and the Board of Ministerial Aid. Within her own community she is on the Board of Directors of Colony Retirement Homes.

Rev. Willan comes to First Church West Hartford from within the United Church of Christ (UCC) Southern New England Conference. She was ordained in 2003 and has served congregations in Massachusetts and Iowa. Rev. Willan holds degrees from Hiram College (Ohio) Boston University and received her Master of Divinity from Vanderbilt Divinity School. She is no stranger to Connecticut having worked in Simsbury early in her career prior to her call to ministry.

As the Search Committee noted Rev. Willan was a pastor who relates well to others. She was candid and genuine. She moved us with her commitments to ministry and her own humanity in the stories she shared. “After our in-person interview with her I remember scanning the circle of faces around me looking for their reactions. Everyone was wearing a mask so it was very hard to tell. But once we had a chance to talk it was clear that all of us knew she was the one we would recommend” stated Carnes. The committee reviewed 17 profiles (or resumés) and interviewed more than half of them. “We had our list of qualities we were seeking for the church at this time. We couldn’t be happier with how everything came together. Our committee quickly came to consensus on Rev. Jane as our recommended candidate” added Carnes.

“I was drawn to the First Church community by its strong use of technology the community outreach the involvement with the Greater Hartford Interfaith Action Alliance (GHIAA) and the interfaith partnerships” commented Rev. Willan during one of four scheduled “meet and greet” sessions with the congregation Jan. 8.

Rev. Willan brings a wealth of knowledge about churches is a self-proclaimed “numbers person” and during the meet and greet she spoke of the need for a senior pastor to be empowering while nurturing the community she serves.

When asked what she will bring to the congregation in West Hartford “one thing that bothers me is when a church says ‘we need to attract more young families.’ I don’t think as a church we attract. What we need to do is be a welcoming place for all people and the growth will come.”

Rev. Willan likes to spend her spare time with her husband Don their dog Moses and cat Winifred. She enjoys writing fiction and is the author of the Sister Agatha and Father Selwyn Mystery Series. She and Don will be relocating to Connecticut in the very near future.

It’s time to put the thinking caps on.

The Vicksburg Theatre Guild’s upcoming performance is a whodunit and audience members will need to pay attention to all the clues.

Based on the 1985 movie which was inspired by the classic Hasbro board game the VTG’s performance of “Clue” is sure to challenge the brightest detectives’ sleuthing skills all while offering up a hilarious evening of fun.

Sarah Goss who is serving as the director of the show said “’Clue’ the movie is considered one of the funniest movies ever made.”

And with the stage performance based on the movie Goss said theatergoers will be chuckling all the way through.

“It’s all so ridiculous” Goss said. “Such a collection of characters. It’s nice to just sit back and laugh.”

Goss said she became interested in directing “Clue” after she had caught the movie on TV.

“It’s so funny and I remember seeing it when I was younger” she said. “I knew there was a musical but I was looking for a fun lighthearted play that people could laugh at. I was excited when I discovered there was a stage play version as well.”

Rehearsals for “Clue” kicked off in December and since then the cast has been working not only on the performance but also on the set.

“Our cast is responsible for set construction and it’s big and complicated” Goss said.

However by building the set it has allowed the cast to become comfortable in navigating it sometimes in very low lighting Goss said which is needed with a performance that has “trap doors hidden panels and all of those things needed for a good murder mystery.”

Nikki Ciciora is serving as the state manager for “Clue” Goss said which has been a “hectic” position in a fasted-paced production.

One of the elements of the production Goss said she thought audience members would enjoy is its nostalgia.

“There is a lot of nostalgia involved with this play. Many of us remember playing the game” she said.

The cast of “Clue” is comprised of 17 actors and those performing in the VTG production are Andrew Cochran as Wadsworth the butler Amy Crews as Yvette and Mary Claire Allison as the cook.

Those taking on the characters of the iconic board game suspects are Jason King as Col. Mustard; Cindy Veazey as Mrs. White; Lisa Hill as Mrs. Peacock; Hunter Weeks as Mr. Green; Ashleigh Holliday as Miss Scarlett and Larry Reaux as Professor Plum.

Rounding out the cast are Cameron Gates Kari Arthur Hope King Sadie Gates Gena Goodson and Danielle Gray.

In addition to the sizable cast Goss said the production has an extensive stage and technical crew.

Performances of “Clue” will be offered at 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 28 and 29 and Feb. 4 and 5 and beginning at 2 p.m. Jan. 30 and Feb. 6 at the Parkside Playhouse Theatre 101 Iowa Ave.

Tickets are $15 $10 for ages 65 and older and 12-18 and $8 for ages 12 and younger and are available the night of the show at the box office. Advance tickets are available online at www.showclix.com/events/10243.

I wrote all that to explain what seems to be the outcome chosen by Hasbro regarding what happens to the Rise of the Beasts toyline. According to this article from



Since the movie is already finished with the live action shooting that means the bulk of what is left is the CGI effects where the bots come into play. And with a whole extra year to deal with that part it is very likely that the toys in the Rise of the Beasts line will not reflect the final look of the characters. This will probably be fine for fans and kids alike since for the fans the toyline was never aimed at them and for kids there won't be anything to compare the toys to. It will simply be another toyline on the shelf for parents to buy and kids to want. If you want to know the contents of the toyline so far please



There had been some rumours of more screen accurate toys coming out for fans after the movie is released but there was never any concrete evidence as to when. As they did with car mode Dropkick and Jet mode Shatter Hasbro may wat until they have the final CGC models to base their sculpts on meaning accurate figures for the film could come out only in 2024.



And yes to further confirm the Rise of the Beasts toyline that is currently set to be coming to stores in 2022 is going to be very similar to the Cyberverse toyline with a myriad of classes based on different gimmicks. It will be interesting to see if Hasbro promotes it at all. The Bumblebee movie line was not heavily promoted to fans with it's announcement coming from the



One last thing since Transformers toylines tend to sell on the basis that they are Transformers toys movie lines are usually stocked and ordered for 2 years/holiday seasons rather than just when the film is out (hence why it was nonstop movie product on shelves between ROTF and DOTM). So it could very well be that the cross promotion will still have a chance to be in full effect in 2023 when the movie comes out.



When we did the year end review what most of us selected as what we were looking forward to seeing this year was what will happen with the Rise of the Beast toyline. As we saw with Godzilla vs Kong Black Widow Snake Eyes and Rise of Gru toy manufacturers and retailers cannot delay a toyline even though it would benefit from being released at the same time as the movie it is linked to. It seems the loss of sale from a lack of cross promotion is not as big as the cost of storing all these products in warehouses for months on end disrupting the established global supply chain from the factory to the retailer. And that's just on the supplying end with issues and loss of revenue also incurred on the retailer end due to a planned product that is not being supplied/stocked and sold.And unlike with Godzilla or Minions Transformers is a toy brand that stands on it's own with a dedicated space and dedicated core market.I wrote all that to explain what seems to be the outcome chosen by Hasbro regarding what happens to the Rise of the Beasts toyline.

The Bumblebee movie line was not heavily promoted to fans with it's announcement coming from the GeekDad website One last thing since Transformers toylines tend to sell on the basis that they are Transformers toys movie lines are usually stocked and ordered for 2 years/holiday seasons rather than just when the film is out (hence why it was nonstop movie product on shelves between ROTF and DOTM). So it could very well be that the cross promotion will still have a chance to be in full effect in 2023 when the movie comes out.

Looking forward to seeing how Wheeljack and the beasts look like. Plus we'll get some art on the boxes giving us first look at the original character models. Surprised there haven't been any leaks on this though Hasbro is usually more sensitive to movie related stuff. Posted by william-james88 on January 17th 2022 @ 9:36am CST

Hmm not sure how I feel about this. Early movie toys are often EXTREMELY inaccurate compared to the film characters they're based on so the film being released later and having a significant chance of changing how they look makes me want to skip these entirely. On the other hand there's always the chance they're just really really good toys (I love my helicopter Dropkick and he barely resembles the character in the Bumblebee movie) so it may not matter how accurate they are to the films.



I guess I'll wait until we see the toys before I make a decision. The only things I'm looking forward to this year was the handful of Beast Wars characters that are allegedly going to release in the current Generations line so it's not like I won't have the funds free (although GI Joe Classified series has been eating into my pockets a lot this past year haha).

I doubt I'd get the gimmicky subline stuff but there could very well be more traditional style toys and Studio Series stuff for the movie releasing at the same time just like they did with Bumblebee.

We've known for months now that there were going to be 0 studio series toys coinciding with ROTB in 2023. Just the movie's own subline. Hence my question.

Very interesting article. While Hasbro will be shipping the toys it'll be interesting to see if retailers order them. I've seen first hand that SOME not all of the Black Widow and Shang Chi toys sat for months before being clearanced out well before the movie hit. The worst part especially in the case of Shang Chi was that those figures were never restocked even if there was demand. The Role Play toys seemed to do well regardless. My gut tells me that Hasbro wants the line out to be the ""Kid-friendly"" line for 2022 since Cyberverse is over. I'm down for these since the kid stuff is my bread and butter.

Yes I think that is both Hasbro and the retailer's plans. They need toys aimed at kids on shelves in 2022. Thankfully unlike with Shang-Shi and Black Widow Transformers sell fine without the need for direct accompanying media since they are a toy brand first and have legacy knowledge (from previous toys/media).



And for the characters that would be new to kids/parents technically it will be no different than when they were selling non show characters in Beast Wars in the 90s.

Okay news I guess I was dissapointed by the Bumblebee toys released with the film. Did get them but sold them right away when Studio Series came along and I'm not a fan of Studio Series.



I hope we can get away from Bay as soon as possible with the Live action stuff. The lovers had 5 movies and 5 big fat toylines + extending Studio Series toys these guys had their stuff. Now I want a completely different more G1 aimed Live Action Transformers movie series please.



Just grab the War for Cybertron Games Unicron Trilogy and Beast wars and be inspired by that with a complely new non-Bionicle 3 milion body parts design. Look at Bumblebee and Pacific Rim.

Man I don't know if I am the only one but I check facebook every couple of hours to see if anyone in the various TF groups I am part of has posted images of the upcoming ROTB toys. Unlike many others I do not think these will get the fan friday treatment. The BB toys were announced with no buzz since they were not targetting collectors same as these. And with them just being 2 months away (as far as we know) they must be out there somewhere not on the factory floor but in packaging and with stock photos available for retail sites. It feels like there is a bunch of stuff out there just waiting to burst out. And in this case it ends up being our first look at any character. So it's very exciting even though the toys themselves are not for me. Posted by william-james88 on January 28th 2022 @ 2:06pm CST

I agree especially since Hasbro doesn't even have anything to promote this year and any kind of big fanfare will just highlight how disappointing the delay is. This will get the Cyberverse treatment our first look will be from a store showing them off and it feels like Hasbro is trying to wait as long as possible before that happens. Like Cyberverse there's still a Deluxe offering that will appeal more to collectors but didn't get a big reveal from Hasbro. Maybe they were planning to display them at Toy Fair but with that not happening probably wont be anything.

I don't think they are that level yet.When the movie comes out they can restock the toys or repackage themmaybe even do something in the same style of the Buzzworthy linewith some minor paint updates.

Well I guess we should be happy Hasbro isn't as draconian about ""leaks"" as Mattel is (and these aren't even leaks!).







Short version: A Jurassic Park toy YouTuber and an Instagrammer both had their channel/page removed without warning by Mattel for showing off toys from the latest JP movie (the YT channel was instantly given 3 strikes by them). One legally bought toys from an online store that released them early while the other showed off stock photos that were already made public and discussed them. The former Instagrammer also got one strike on their YT channel. Both spent years supporting Mattel's JP toy line and driving customers to the line only for Mattel to do something like this in retaliation for something the content creators couldn't have possibly imagined was wrong (and really isn't) rather than going off the stores selling the figures early and originally posting the stock photos.



Just imagine what it would be like if Hasbro did the same thing. With all the leaked information from insiders and photos of figures stolen from factories out there around the internet it seems like it wouldn't take much for Hasbro to completely decimate a large chunk of the fandom on the net if they chose to. I guess we can be thankful that Hasbro is a little more fan aware and forgiving or else things could look very different.



I posted this here because RotB toys are coming soon complete with an April release that seems pretty solid as a street date. Pictures will be showing up pretty soon but I doubt Hasbro will make any kind of big deal out of them showing up early since the movie is still well over a year away so I doubt they're too concerned with the toys spoiling anything at this point.

Age Range (Description) 6 YEARS+

Model Name MV7 BA BEAST BATTLE MASTER RHINOX

Material Plastic



Here is the link to the listing: While we still do not have any images we have more evidence of the Rise of the Beast toys coming our way soon. We now have a listing for Transformers Movie 7 Beast Battle Master RHINOX. This is the cheapest and smallest class in the line and we still don't really know what it looks like nor exactly what it entails. Legion class would be fun but we are still not sure. Some fans already bought it just to see what they would get and the item is said to be arriving April 15th.Here is the link to the listing: https://www.amazon.com/dp/b09mjpgqz6?tag=seibertron07-20&ta ... formers-20 Posted by william-james88 on February 10th 2022 @ 1:21pm CST

I highly doubt it.

The smol BW characters are only in the OG BW universe. Every times the Beasts and normal TF interacted with each others in WFC comics and so on they were all the same size. Meaning giant freaking animals. So I'm pretty sure the live movie will be no different. I highly doubt it.The smol BW characters are only in the OG BW universe.

Maybe in the toy line that's why the beasts are weaponizer style figures? Imagine if the studio series toys are the same size as the Arcee sisters they could do all the characters in two releases. The more I think about it the more I like the idea. Maybe in the toy line that's why the beasts are weaponizer style figures?

If we are to believe all this which is the most logical explanation for this toy then we can start the fun speculation we were all giddy for with us getting hints at designs in the film from the toys for the kid centric line.



This Optimus Prime for instance becomes our first look at what Prime will look like in robot mode. It basically confirms that they are keeping the same model that we saw in the Bumblebee movie (further confirming that this is a sequel to that film if anyone still doubted that). The alt mode is inaccurate to what we have seen on set but then again it does resemble an offroad racing truck and Bumblebee is getting an offroad upgrade in the film. So this is either a hint of what we could see in the film or (more probably) of what could have been planned for the film at one point. We saw that many times in the past like in Age of Extinction with all the product for a dropped Silver Knight Optimus component to the film and Slash a Dinobot that was also dropped from the film. It could also simply by a toyline only offroad theme to go with Bumblebee giving kids and parents something new and thematic while still familiar.



Also this toy would/could be the Smash Changers Optimus Prime from the Rise of the Beasts line that we reported on



Smash Changers

Optimus Prime (5010993958474)















Alright so this is in response to some confusion that we got with Hasbro's announcement earlier today for a new Optimus Prime toy. Now that the toy is out for us to see people who claim to be in the know (we will keep the sources private unless they express otherwise) have said that this toy is actually part of the Rise of the Beasts toyline. Instead of a Rise of the Beasts toyline coming out in April both waves will be out on shelves later this year in Cyberverse packaging. That would mean that Hasbro was able to stir the ship while the product was not at packaging stage yet. This would also let the retailers get the product they ordered and had prepped for in their planning of both their shelf space and finances though at a later date than anticipated. It is also telling that we see the toy in the ad and not the packaging. Hasbro is being quick on their toes on this one.If we are to believe all this which is the most logical explanation for this toy then we can start the fun speculation we were all giddy for with us getting hints at designs in the film from the toys for the kid centric line.This Optimus Prime for instance becomes our first look at what Prime will look like in robot mode.

That makes sense but weren't retailers phasing out there Cyberverse spacing for EarthSpark then? Where do these go? Or are retailers going to make room for these instead of the Movie line since that's no longer happening? In other words Cyberverse will take up the space meant for the movie line until the movie is released? Posted by Overcracker on February 18th 2022 @ 1:47pm CST

Yeah they are definitely trying to reorient this massive line in the most cost effective way. Not only is that line established in terms of design assets but also in terms of expectations. Cyberverse is the young kids toyline so that's what will be used for these toys which are made for your kids.

While the toys may not excite fans what is exciting is that this is our very first look at Optimus Primal from Rise of the Beasts. Of course it is likely that the final movie model will look different BUT this does give us an indication that they are being closer to the original designs than the Bayverse bots were in the first movie. It also gives us an idea of scale meaning that Prime and Primal would be around the same size as has been the standard scale of late. You'll also notice that this Optimus Prime toy also turns into the same off road truck mode as the previous toy. These should be released through the Cyberverse line this year. The Images come from a Chefatron review.























































Remember the Bumblebee movie line? It was entirely aimed at kids with lot of gimmicks. Well the Rise of the Beasts line will mostly be the same. We saw the 3 step Optimus a month back and now we see Optimus Prime in a different scale along with Optimus Primal and a Tigatron accessory which serves as a weaponiser.While the toys may not excite fans what is exciting is that this is our very first look at Optimus Primal from Rise of the Beasts.

That Primal looks great even if it is super simple. Guess I'll be shelling out for Movie Maximals now.



Even this Primal has an interesting transformation to him. I really like him. Might just pick him up while we wait for thew actual movie line.



Tigatron relegated to a filleted crossbow... the indignity.

The ruling lands not long after the one-year anniversary of widespread vaccine distribution in a country still largely split over how best to protect Americans during a pandemic that has produced multiple surges. In upholding the Biden administration’s requirement for millions of health care workers the decision could wedge health care workers between opposing state and federal policies.

Local and regional hospitals as well as multistate hospital chains have wrestled with the resistance among some nurses and other staff to the Covid vaccines. Many of the larger hospital groups including the Cleveland Clinic and HCA Healthcare suspended their own vaccination mandates last month while they awaited the Supreme Court’s decision. And some are still assessing the conflict with murky anti-vaccine requirements imposed in Florida Texas and some other states.

But the rising infections among staffs in hospitals and nursing homes among the unvaccinated and the vaccinated have lent urgency to the mandates even though some hospitals and nursing homes warn of staff defections spurred by enforcing immunization.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9yZW5ldy1ob3VzdG9uL2hlYWx0aC9hcnRpY2xlL2NsZWFyLWxha2UtaG9zcGl0YWwtY2hhcGxhaW4tY292aWQtbWlzc2lvbi0xNjc3MjQ1My5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He came in like Superman': A Clear Lake hospital chaplain's COVID mission,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.houstonchronicle.com/lifestyle/renew-houston/health/article/clear-lake-hospital-chaplain-covid-mission-16772453.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9yZW5ldy1ob3VzdG9uL2hlYWx0aC9hcnRpY2xlL2NsZWFyLWxha2UtaG9zcGl0YWwtY2hhcGxhaW4tY292aWQtbWlzc2lvbi0xNjc3MjQ1My5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3JpY2htb25kLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2Nyb3dkZWQtaG9zcGl0YWxzLWluLXZpcmdpbmlhLWhhdmUtZmV3LW9wZW4tYmVkcy10by1vZmZlci10aGUtcnVzaC1vZi1wYXRpZW50cy9hcnRpY2xlXzVmMzcxNmM2LTNlZGEtNTk5OC04NTEwLTk0NmVmZjE3NzBhNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crowded hospitals in Virginia have few open beds to offer the rush of patients,"Sean Bennett started throwing up blood so he went to the emergency room at LewisGale Hospital Montgomery near his home in Southwest Virginia. Bennett has dealt with prolonged liver disease for over a year sending him to the hospital repeatedly.

A small community facility LewisGale didn’t have a gastrointestinal doctor available to treat his condition an enlarging of the veins in his esophagus called esophageal varices. There wasn’t a hospital with both a GI doctor and an available bed for 200 miles.

“They tried everywhere” said Bennett 38.

So LewisGale staff put him in an ambulance and sent him 3½ hours east to Henrico Doctors’ Hospital which had a bed and a doctor.

But a few weeks later in late summer he was spitting up blood again and he returned to LewisGale. This time the closest available bed was 250 miles away at Reston Hospital Center. Doctors determined his condition was so urgent they sent him there in a helicopter.

When he became ill for a third time LewisGale put him back in a helicopter and flew him to Henrico Doctors’ once again sending him across the state.

Six months after the nursing crisis began omicron has brought the highest number of COVID-19 patients to Virginia hospitals putting beds at a premium and patients with all types of ailments at risk.

Some patients like Bennett have been transferred hours away across the state. Others remain in hospitals ill-equipped to treat them. And others sit in emergency room beds — or chairs — waiting for an open bed upstairs.

Waiting diminishes the care the patients receive and searching for open beds eats up the precious time of emergency room staff.

Last week the state continued setting records for hospitalized COVID patients with more than 3500 per day.

There were nearly 90000 emergency room visits the first week of the year 45% higher than before the pandemic began. The non-COVID patients are generally sicker than before.

Virginia Commonwealth University Health’s downtown medical center “is seeing unprecedented demand for inpatient care” a spokesperson said.

As patients flood in they are being treated by a smaller weary medical workforce that lost 8100 nurses nationwide in September alone.

This perfect storm represents a “failure of our bigger medical system as a whole” said Dr. David Fosnocht head of Augusta Emergency Physicians in Augusta County.

Transferring patients

In the fall a patient with a brain bleed arrived at an emergency room in eastern Virginia. Dr. Todd Parker president-elect of the Virginia College of Emergency Physicians determined the patient needed to be transferred to a larger hospital with an ICU.

Parker and his staff contacted 17 hospitals in five states but couldn’t find an open bed. After 12 hours of searching a bed became available in the same hospital system.

From his hospital in Hampton Roads he has sent patients to University of Virginia Health Duke Health and Inova Fairfax.

Before the pandemic Fosnocht often transferred patients to Roanoke Carilion and UVA. Now those hospitals are often full sending him to look in all corners of the state. One night he could find only one available intermediate-level bed — hospital beds are divided into categories based on severity of illness — in the entire state.

The longer a patient is in transit the greater the risk doctors say. Transferring critically ill patients to a new hospital often means taking them out of the hospital and putting them in an ambulance for an hourslong trip.

Transferring patients is labor intensive and takes a doctor’s time away from other patients. Fosnocht carries a printed spreadsheet of 25 or so of the largest hospitals in the state. It’s updated regularly to show which ones have the capacity for new patients. The open ones are highlighted.

To initiate a transfer he calls the closest open hospital on the list. He usually starts with UVA — a 40-minute drive away — or Carilion Roanoke which is 1½ hours away. When a hospital tells him it can’t accept his patient he moves down the list and expands his geographic circle.

If he can find a receiving hospital in 15 or 30 minutes that’s a success. The difficult transfers take hours.

For years he never transferred patients to Inova Fairfax which is more than two hours away. Now he does so routinely. Sometimes he sends patients to Hampton Roads some three hours away.

If no bed can be found a patient might stay in a sub-optimal hospital. During one week in September when the delta variant was at its worst there were 27% fewer transfers than the same week in 2019.

If a patient can’t be transferred the hospital will hold them hoping conditions don’t worsen. If they don’t worsen sometimes the patient can be released. If they do worsen the hospital will search for a transfer destination again asking other facilities to make an exception for a serious condition.

Transferring a patient also raises the cost of the medical bill.

A 50-mile transport through the Richmond Ambulance Authority can cost $2500.

And it occupies transport services. Augusta Health typically operates two ambulances of its own at a time depending on staffing. If one ambulance is dispatched to Hampton Roads half of the hospital’s ambulance resources become tied up for more than six hours.

American Medical Response operates many of the inter-hospital transports in the area. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment.

‘Boarding’ in the ER

Sometimes a patient doesn’t need to be transferred away but the hospital doesn’t have a bed to offer either. So the hospital admits the patient but keeps them in the emergency room while waiting for a bed upstairs a circumstance known as “boarding.”

One day this winter in a 50-bed emergency room in Hampton Roads 36 beds held a patient boarding Parker said. That creates a logjam preventing the emergency room from seeing other sick people.

Recently having 10 or 20 patients boarding in his ER is normal Parker said. Long an issue in health care boarding has been exacerbated by omicron and the nursing shortage.

Sometimes it takes two or three days for a bed to open up — maybe a patient’s entire hospital stay.

“It’s horrible” Fosnocht said. “It continues a downstream effect on quality and being able to take care of patients the way it really should be done.”

While boarding patients don’t get the same level of care the doctors said. The emergency room is chaotic noisy and bright and it’s a hard place for patients to sleep. Instead of a dedicated nurse staffers rotate in and out. The nurses are less familiar with the patient’s medicine and treatment. The doctor in charge isn’t down the hall — they are on another floor maybe on another wing.

Those small details result in poorer care Fosnocht said. Boarding is “a significant risk to morbidity and mortality every hour they’re there.”

When every room is full patients may wait in chairs be seen in the waiting room or get a bed in a hallway.

When an emergency room can accept no more patients it gives itself a designation known as diversion directing ambulances to go elsewhere. Diversion isn’t unusual — one day last month 12 hospitals in the region were simultaneously on some form of diversion unable to accept certain patients based on their medical needs.

In less urban areas hospitals can’t go on diversion because there are no other nearby facilities.

Lower staffing

Burnt out nurses have left emergency rooms and intensive care units in droves. In Virginia the workforce of about 100000 nurses is probably 10% below what is needed Kathy Baker associate chief nurse for VCU Health said in the summer.

The number of nurses employed can sometimes dictate the number of beds a hospital can keep open. At Augusta fewer nurses have forced the hospital to operate about 25% fewer beds than ideal Fosnocht said. The three major health systems in Richmond — VCU Health Bon Secours and HCA — declined to say how many nurses they have lost this year and if they are staffing fewer beds.

The hospital’s other option is to operate the same number of beds with fewer nurses stretching their staff thinner giving every nurse more patients to care for.

“There are just no options for nursing staffing right now” Fosnocht said. “It’s a nationwide crisis and it certainly is in Virginia and locally here as well.”

Hospitals are left competing for scarce resources squeezing their budgets to pay nurses more even though they aren’t receiving higher reimbursement from insurance companies.

In response to the surge and staffing shortage then-Gov. Ralph Northam declared a limited state of emergency last week designed to allow hospitals to expand their staffing capacity.

Sometimes it’s easier to send a patient not to the hospital 30 minutes down the road but to the one three hours away. That’s what happened to Bennett.

A hospital will go to greater lengths to accept a patient already in the health system. Because large hospitals are already taking patients from smaller facilities in their own system they often cannot accept patients from other systems.

When Bennett got sick and went to Montgomery LewisGale he entered a facility owned by HCA Virginia Health System. Doctors sent him to two other HCA hospitals — Henrico Doctors’ and Reston Hospital Center. A spokesperson for HCA said doctors consider a patient’s needs bed availability the timeliness of the transfer and continuity of care to decide if the patient will stay in the system or leave it.

When Bennett arrived at Henrico his gastrointestinal doctor recommended Bennett stop visiting LewisGale because he’d keep getting transferred Bennett said. The doctor recommended Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital about a 40-minute drive from his home. It’s the largest hospital in the Carilion system and it was unlikely Bennett would be transferred farther from home.",,,,,,

A fan has a chance to hang with the Hall of Famer. Emmitt Smith sits next the bust made of chocolate. A fan has a chance to hang with the Hall of Famer.

Emmitt Smith has one of the most eclectic trophy cases in all of sports but his most recent edition won't be bronzed or gold it's a bust made of chocolate. Hershey's created the sculpture to kick-off the Hershey's Pro Football Hall of Fame Sweepstakes where a fan can win a trip for four to join Smith at this year's enshrinement weekend in August.

Smith is still waiting for his actual Hall of Fame bust to get delivered after getting inducted last year during his first year of eligibility.

""It just won't be bronzed like they have in the Hall of Fame"" Smith said. ""I want it to be bronzed. I have to pay for it but I want one.""

No freebies for the champ? For now his trophy case will settle on a chocolate placeholder -- which is fine by him.

""I like Reese's Kit Kats; I like the Oreo Cookies n' Cream Hershey's"" said Smith between crunches. Although he admitted he only ate chocolate ""probably once or twice a week"" he couldn't help but reflect: ""Remember they use to put Hershey's syrup on top of the ice cream and it would turn hard?""

""You couldn't really eat anything sweet until after you had your meal pretty much"" Smith said of his childhood. ""I did the best I could when it came down to eating the vegetables.""

The vegetables paid off and among his awards from his years with the Cowboys are three Super Bowl Championship rings an NFL Most Valuable Player award a Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award and last year's Pro Football Hall of Fame ring.

""Last year was such a blur because I was involved in about a thousand things and being pulled all over the place and really having a chance to enjoy the Hall of Fame from a fan perspective was a little bit challenging for me"" said Smith who's excited to return to Canton Ohio.

So what will this year be like for the lucky fan who gets to spend a weekend with Emmitt Smith?

""You know how they say beauty is in the eyes of the beholder? Well hanging out with me he might like it somebody might say it was boring. You never know.""

While it's doubtful a weekend with Smith could be boring the lucky contest winner will get the consolation of taking home a chocolate bust in their own likeness.

""I was told the chocolate will not melt away unless you put it somewhere where it's hot"" Smith said. ""If you take care of it it will take care of you.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZsb3JlbnRpbmUubmV0LzIwMjIvMDEvMTYvbW96YXJ0LWFuZC1maWdhcm8taW4tdmllbm5hLWEtc3VtcHR1b3VzLW5ldy1tdXNpY2FsLXBsYXktYnktaGVyc2hleS1mZWxkZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mozart and Figaro in Vienna: a new musical play by Hershey Felder,"Imagine two hours of operatic entertainment interspersed with humour in the comfort of your own home: that’s what Canadian creative genius Hershey Felder has achieved in his latest (and perhaps greatest) musical film to be shot entirely in Florence.

Mozart and Figaro in Vienna begins with a dusty scene set in the only Italian bookshop in 1830s New York City which was actually filmed at Florence’s palatial and private art gallery the Bellini Museum. A theatrically aged Felder plays Lorenzo Da Ponte in his twilight years who was “Italian poet to the Emperor Joseph the Second” and the long-overlooked librettist of Mozart’s three operas The Marriage of Figaro Don Giovanni and Così fan tutte. The action quickly switches to the film’s other Florentine location the grandiose riverside Palazzo Gianfigliazzi Bonaparte whose impressive original parquet floors gilded mouldings and entrancing natural light conjure up the late eighteenth-century imperial palace in Vienna.

“Florence is our film studio home” Felder explained to The Florentine. “Florence has provided our films both with original historic locations particular to Florence from Tchaikovsky’s actual Florentine residence to real locations of Dante’s Florentine life to Czarist Russia Puccini’s operatic settings and more. With Mozart while certain interiors were to be filmed in our base in Florence The Kaiser’s Palace in Vienna was on one of location schedules. With complete lockdown in Austria this became impossible—and as can only happen in Florence Maria Maestrelli de Hagenauer owner of the Palazzo Gianfigliazzi on lungarno Corsini opened the Palazzo to us to serve as the Kaiser’s palace. The location came upon its designation as a Mozart environment honestly. The entirely restored decor is from the late 18th century Mozart’s period and even more relevantly the de Hagenauers of Vienna Maria’s family by marriage were Mozart’s landlords for much of their Viennese residency. The wonders of Florence never cease.”

What follows in the film is the epitome of learning through entertainment as Da Ponte presents Mozart’s six-weeks-in-the-making opera The Marriage of Figaro to the Emperor played by Jay Natelle (House of Gucci Medici Ben Hur) calling upon each character in turn to perform scenes from the opera as the librettist gives a synopsis. The relationship between Mozart (Filippo Ciabatti director of music of the Dartmouth Symphony Orchestra and a native Florentine) and Da Ponte proves captivating as the famous composer displays a meek conductor’s role compared with the wordsmith’s flamboyant stage direction although Felder’s Da Ponte wholly acknowledges Mozart’s musical gift while craving at least a sliver of the recognition. Nathan Gunn (as Count Almaviva) Ekaterina Siurina (Countess Rosina) Timothy Renner (Figaro) Hila Plitmann (Susanna) and Xenia Tziouvaras (Cherubino) all shine in their roles accompanied by musicians from the Maggio Musicale Orchestra. Filmed as one extended scene on the piano nobile of the thirteenth-century palazzo by the experienced all-Italian crew led by director Stefano Decarli the exquisite costumes from Nicolao Venetian atelier par excellence and luscious wigs from Florentine institution Filistrucchi add authenticity and prestige to the screen.

Felder continues: “I’ve always said: Point a camera anywhere in Florence and whatever will be on your screen will be beautiful. The greatest treat however are the living breathing artists now working in Florence. The Maggio Musicale Fiorentina orchestra the members of which I have had the honor to play with in four Florentine-made films so far are a world-class ensemble led by Zubin Mehta the legendary conductor. As individuals the musicians are generous and willing to take anything on including being getting all dressed up in eighteenth-century garb! The wealth of artists is limitless. Almost to a one the film crew—directors cinematographers lighting designers editors costume designers electricians gaffers runners—are Florence-born. Besides being immensely gifted they are a group of kind individuals who will work endless hours to make everything the best that it can be. There is a deep commitment to the best art possible in the Florentine tradition. The group has even welcomed the world-renowned costume designer Stefano Nicolao from Venice who costumed our Mozart film. Stefano is known worldwide for his costumes for Hollywood hits such as Farinelli Casanova Elizabeth and more. The goal is to find and illuminate the world-class talents within Florence and our environs and create stories that we can share that show just how beautiful our city and its people are.”

Viewers learn how the poet was born in Venice as Emanuele Conegliano and had his name changed through baptism upon his father’s marriage to a 17-year-old Catholic girl. Living a colourful life despite being a priest in La Serenissima he suffered exile for repercussions from an affair with a married woman which is how he ended up in Vienna. We find out that he moved to London on the death of the emperor before bankruptcy drove him to New York. Felder details Da Ponte’s life in character with humour and charisma in this film that educates and informs about a little-known yet essential figure in musical history. Indeed we wonder how we had never heard of this talented writer before so many are the firsts that Felder reveals: Da Ponte was the first person to bring an Italian opera to the stage in New York to raise funding for the metropolis’ first opera house on the corner of Leonard and Church Street and the city’s first university Italian class.

DAUPHIN COUNTY Pa. — One day ahead of what was supposed to be her 100th birthday hundreds of people visited a local museum to honor the life of the late Betty White.

The Hershey Antique Auto Museum hosted an unofficial ""Betty White Day"" at its location in Derry Township recognizing the actress's special connection to the museum: A man from Texas donated White's 1977 Cadillac Seville named ""Parakeet"" to the AACA.

""Betty White appeals to everybody it seems like"" said AACA Museum Executive Director Jeffrey Bliemeister. ""No one ever seems to say anything bad about Betty White and we are just really fortunate to have her car here.""

Bliemeister says for years the museum has housed White's old Cadillac and even received a letter from her saying she was glad it was there.

""When we got it in 2008 I wrote to Betty White's agent and I asked if Betty would be willing to come out and dedicate the car in the museum and I got a wonderful handwritten note back from Betty first her agent saying she's too busy and then from Betty saying 'I'm glad to know that my car' she said by the way the car's name is Parakeet 'I named all my cars after birds and she's in good hands.'""

People are also encouraged to donate to an animal shelter on Jan. 17 in honor of White who was an avid animal lover.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZWFnbGVzLXNlYXNvbi1lbmRzLWluLTMxLTE1LWxvc3MtdG8tYnVjcy_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMyNy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2VhZ2xlcy1zZWFzb24tZW5kcy1pbi0zMS0xNS1sb3NzLXRvLWJ1Y3MvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eagles season ends in 31-15 loss to Bucs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.abc27.com/sports/eagles-season-ends-in-31-15-loss-to-bucs/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZWFnbGVzLXNlYXNvbi1lbmRzLWluLTMxLTE1LWxvc3MtdG8tYnVjcy_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMyNy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2VhZ2xlcy1zZWFzb24tZW5kcy1pbi0zMS0xNS1sb3NzLXRvLWJ1Y3MvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Based on recent revelation of HPE’s involvement in Israel’s prison and surveillance systems the movement has called for the reinvigorated campaign. “Let us teach HP and through it all corporate criminals that profiting from war crimes and human rights violations comes at a steep price” the Palestinian BDS National Committee said in an announcement on January 10.

The Committee cited that Who Profits an independent research organisation has revealed that HP Enterprise which was founded in 2015 after the split of Hewlett-Packard Company into HP Inc and HPE continues to provide services to Israeli prisons and police.

According to Who Profits “HPE which specialises in the manufacturing and marketing of storage and server hardware retained several occupation-related involvements through its Israeli subsidiary Hewlett Packard (Israel) Ltd.”

Amid its notable involvement with Israel is HPE’s service to the country from 2017 to 2020 as the sole provider of Itanium servers for the ‘Aviv’ System. The Israeli Administration of Border Crossings Population and Immigration uses the Aviv computerisation system which contains the Population Registry with information on Palestinian citizens and non-citizen residents of occupied East Jerusalem. The System also includes the ‘Yesha database’ which contains information on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank and Gaza settlements Who Profits reported. HPE’s business partner DXC Technology developed operated and maintained this system while HPE itself supplied the required servers for it.

The BDS Committee said this database in Aviv which includes Palestinian citizens and East Jerusalem residents has “facilitated Israel’s efforts to ethnically cleanse and colonize Sheikh Jarrah Silwan and other Palestinian neighbourhoods in occupied Jerusalem.”

The BDS Committee noted that HPE’s contract providing servers for the Aviv System has ended according to a recent Who Profits report. “This achievement comes on the heels of over a decade of effective campaigning against HP by solidarity groups churches unions and progressive city councils across the world” the BDS Committee said.

While celebrating this development after their ’Boycott HP’ campaign and claiming a shift in favour of Palestinian liberation and against Israeli apartheid the movement called for intensifying the BDS campaigns against HP-branded companies due to the recent revelations of the company’s continued involvement with the Israeli government. Referring to the Who Profits report the BDS Committee said “HP remains deeply complicit in Israel’s grave human rights violations.”

Who Profits reports “In 2020 [HPE] was contracted to provide computer and communication maintenance for Israel Prison Service for 2021-2022 for the amount of over NIS 1 Million (>300000 USD)”. In 2021 the company was also given the contract to maintain servers for the Israel Police until 2023 in the amount of NIS 4 million.

Noting that over 500 Palestinian administrative detainees have called for a boycott of Israeli military courts and are mobilising against the policy the BDS Committee said “We are escalating our campaign against HP as part of our commitment to the just demands of the Palestinian administrative detainees and other political prisoners in apartheid Israel’s dungeons.”

Launched in 2005 by 170 Palestinian unions refugee networks women’s organisations resistance committees and Palestinian civil society groups the BDS movement has gained support in its quest to win justice for Palestine.

The ‘Boycott HP’ campaign has grown over the years spreading across the globe and drawing support from major trade unions including the United Kingdom’s second-largest Unite the Union and the Netherlands’ largest trade union federation Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging (FNV) and the Students Federation of India (SFI) which has 4 million members.

Moreover along with prominent churches the city councils of Dublin in Ireland and Portland and Oregon in the United States have also divested from HP companies over their involvement in alleged human rights violations.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The first TownePlace Suites will share a parking lot with the Staybridge Suites at 12170 James St. near Holland Town Center. The 100-room hotel received approval from the Holland Township Planning Commission in January 2020 and its permit for construction several weeks ago.

The extended-stay hotel is being constructed by Stellar Development LLC of Auburn Hills under the Marriott brand. Before its approval commissioners expressed concern about the number of hotels considered over the past few years and potential for oversaturation of the market.

But they ultimately determined it was the role of the township board to decide what should and shouldn't be built. The TownePlace Suites was approved unanimously.

The second hotel was approved by the planning commission Tuesday Jan. 4 for the plot behind the Hilton Home2 Suites at 3140 West Shore Drive. The limited-service TRU by Hilton will have 98 rooms and developers intend to establish entry on Riley Street.

The Home2 Suites from the same developers opened in January 2019. The extended-stay hotel has been ""successful"" applicant David Howat told commissioners. He added he understands the concern about new hotels in Holland Township but said the Home2 Suites is outperforming projections and a market study showed conditions warrant more rooms.

Staff recommended commissioners deny the request given the unusual site location and the presence of six hotels within 2000 feet of the proposed site diminishing the mixed-use plan for the area. Staff also noted two of the three newest hotels in the township are seeking negative adjustments to their assessed values.

But commissioners voted to approve the request followed later in the meeting by approval of a site plan.

The Holland Area Convention and Visitors Bureau funded by a tax on local hotel rooms has more than 1900 units after adding Zeeland Charter Township — and the new Avid Hotel near I-196 — to its region. The new hotels would push that number above 2000.

In the past three years Holland Township has added the Home2 Suites the neighboring SpringHill Suites and the Staybridge Suites to its offerings.

That's a lot of addition for a difficult time for hospitality. Occupancy for the entire year of 2021 was below 2019 levels according to Linda Hart executive director of the visitors bureau. Holland was once a beacon for corporate visitors but the COVID-19 pandemic has lowered numbers significantly as workers switch to hybrid options.

""I think people want to get back into traveling and going to places"" Hart said. ""I think this is a temporary place that we're in when it comes to meetings. It's been determined that meeting in-person is better. It accomplishes more people get to network more so we're investing more in the convention and group markets so we have a stronger presence.""

Holland is also a natural destination for sporting events.

""That's starting to really take off with the expansion of the (Holland) Aquatic Center"" Hart said. ""It's already seeing an increase in tournaments. Holland is very popular with hockey and softball already and we're looking at ultimate frisbee.""

With new businesses opening and planning for Tulip Time underway Hart remains optimistic.

""It's really indicative of our community"" she said. ""If you talk about a perfect storm and the growth and development of our downtown it's truly a sweet spot for business owners to come in. We are so fortunate to have a community that is a year-round destination. We are blessed to live in a community that continues to thrive.""

Gorgeous hikes along the cliffs and down to tide pool laden beaches start at the resort and the cliffside dining is one of the prettiest sunset spots in town.

13. The Great Wolf Lodge — Garden Grove

What tot doesn't love a gigantic indoor water park? Located in close proximity to Disneyland and other major attractions the Great Wolf Lodge is a theme park in its own right. The list of things to do here is nearly endless—kids may even forget about Mickey and Minnie. Besides the indoor water park with 14 slides and four pools there's a craft station a bowling alley an arcade glow-in-the-dark mini-golf and fun activities like a magical interactive treasure hunt game storytime and nightly PJ dance parties. The hotel boasts several dining and shopping options a kids' spa and a fitness center. What's in it for the parents? Endless smiles and a sweet deal: if you stay for two nights you get one-day tickets to Disneyland Resort and three days of free water park passes.

14. Disneyland Hotel — Anaheim

The big daddy of all the family-friendly hotels in Southern California is the Disneyland Resort Hotel. This hotel is (essentially) designed for children so there's plenty for them to see and do during your stay—and of course Disneyland is right next door. There's the iconic original hotel as well as newer hotels like the Grand Californian and Paradise Pier which each offer unique kid-friendly activities and entertainment.

15. Howard Johnson Anaheim — Anaheim

This hotel is located right next to Disneyland and makes for a great family stay at a more budget-friendly rate than the Disneyland Hotel. The big draw at the Howard Johnson is Castaway Cove its large Pirate-themed outdoor water playground. While the kids splash around and ride the water slide parents can relax in the hot tub. Plus you'll save on parking at Disneyland because the hotel is just a short walk from the park's entrance."

But every now and again I find something so wacky that it simply defies classification.

The latest example of Lamarckian evolution run amok on the most infamous Chinese shopping site of all is this funky “Spider Bike”.

What the dickens is a Spider Bike? Well it is so anti-classification that even its name makes no sense.

For starters it’s not a bike and it’s also four legs short of a round eight. But I’m going to keep calling it the Spider Bike because the only other option is to use its model number which is YUEHEZHIZHUCHE03. Seriously.

“Spider Bike” it is.

And nomenclature aside there’s something oddly enthralling about the Spider Bike. Its articulating arms full independent suspension race car seat and four-point harness give it an aggressive look that seems to meld Mad Max vibes with something that escaped from an amusement park.

But even if it’s got a face only a mother could love the functionality sure seems like a lot of fun.





All four of the arms (legs? transporters?) move independently and so it looks like you actually get a pretty stable ride even when traversing gullies and other extreme topographical anomalies.

It’s also got four-wheel drive thanks to each wheel housing a direct drive hub motor. There’s no power rating but each of those motors looks like it could easily be in the 1-2 kW range. A total of 4-8 kW or up to around 10 hp sounds like a lot of fun on a half-amputated mechanized spider.

And considering the thing can hit speeds of up to 48 km/h (30 mph) it definitely sounds like its got some power behind it.

The Spider Bike also comes with a max payload of 200 kg (440 lb) meaning you could use this monstrosity for some utility work too! Imagine pulling up to Home Depot in this contraption and loading up a few bags of cement – that is if you can still afford to go shopping after buying one of these. With a price of US $7385 it’s one of the more expensive oddball Alibaba electric vehicles I’ve featured on these pages. And that’s before you even ship the thing halfway around the world.

I was kind of hoping it would disassemble into something the size of suitcase so that it’d be easy to ship. Sure it’d take 6-8 weeks to assemble it again and you may never get all the bits and pieces in the correct places but at least the freight wouldn’t cost an arm and a first born.

But no check out the shipping crate they package this thing in. You could practically back up the Suez Canal again all by yourself!

Hell you might as well save the crate when you’re done and rent it out as a studio apartment. Or put a tarp over it and use it as a detached garage for parking your Spider Bike.

Look regular readers will know that I’m no stranger to buying dumb awesome things I find on Alibaba. For some reason millions of people have tuned in to watch me gamble away my paycheck on an electric mini pickup truck and other weird things from China.

So I’m sorry to disappoint you fine (I’m assuming) folks but this Spider Bike isn’t going to be joining the party at my house anytime soon.

But that’s probably for the best. Just look at the how much fun the dudes from the Chinese factory are having driving it in the video below. I’d hate to take it away from them.

If that wacky electric Spider Bike wasn’t enough for you check out some of the other fun and crazy things I’ve found in the past!

And if you happen to find something interesting in the millions of pop-ups that Alibaba is sure to serve you feel free to send it my way!

If you buy through our links we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.

New recommendations from federal health officials advise Americans that respirator masks may provide more protection against COVID-19 this winter.

N95 masks also known as respirators have been proven to provide better filtration and protection over cloth masks made earlier in the pandemic.

Research suggests disposable surgical masks are nearly as efficient in filtering nearby airborne particles as respirators when worn correctly and even more effective when worn with a cloth mask on top.

We're sharing Good Housekeeping Institute experts' and editors' picks for the most effective face masks to purchase for the winter season below.

Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have updated current mask guidelines to acknowledge that respirators ""provide more protection to the wearer"" than cloth masks. The move comes as CDC officers have confirmed Omicron is more easily transmissible than the Delta strain — and now increasing numbers of health professionals across the country stress that many cloth-based face masks may not provide sufficient protection against Omicron specifically.

Americans may wish to upgrade masks they've purchased or made reaching back to mid-2020 to better-designed options particularly advocating for surgical-style disposable masks as well as top-grade N95 or KN95 respirators. Experts have long established that respirators are the best possible option to filter and block contagious SARS-CoV-2 particles (the virus that leads to a COVID-19 diagnosis). But many may be surprised to hear that research like Duke University's landmark 2021 study indicates that disposable surgical masks were the next most effective piece of protection against the virus.

Lexie Sachs the Good Housekeeping Institute's Textiles Director says there are multiple classifications that shoppers can keep an eye out for when looking for well-made masks or respirator options. Primarily industry organization ASTM provides standards for manufacturers to follow in production. In addition to products that meet ASTM standards the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (known as NIOSH) regulates approval for respirators and has published tips for determining when an N95 may be counterfeit.

We're highlighting the most protective masks and respirators you can purchase now below and with Sachs's help and expert-driven data we're recapping need-to-know info about shopping for legitimately effective mask designs.

What's the best mask to protect against the Omicron variant?

Once reserved solely for healthcare workers at the onset of the pandemic respirators like a NIOSH-approved N95 are the most effective at filtering the air around you — and since Omicron has been shown to be increasingly viral in small crowded and under-ventilated spaces respirators are best. Respirators carry proven efficacy in their names alone; an N95 stops 95% of particles in the air around you from entering your nose and mouth per experts at the Cleveland Clinic.

Though not all respirators are made in America many can be just as effective as N95s — the issue that plagues consumers now however are counterfeit masks that are marketed as true respirators which are regulated for quality assurance. NIOSH maintains a list of approved N95 respirators making it easier to find one that'll really work; usually they are made with two head-bound straps a wire nose clip as well as labels that indicate NIOSH approval according to the CDC.

Internationally made options like KN95s KF94s FFP3s or R95s aren't always regulated by NIOSH and unlike N95s U.S. health officials do not certify or approve them officially. In fact about 60% of KN95 respirators sold in the U.S. carry bogus NIOSH approval which has pushed CDC officials to have to publish guidance on telltale signs that a respirator isn't as protective as you may think.

But there may be another reason Americans may wish to turn to a surgical mask over a respirator despite any differences in filtration abilities — all respirators must be properly fitted and sealed against your face to work as promised and many healthcare experts say this is tricky for most people to do correctly. Surgical masks are easier to wear properly.

Surgical masks can be up to 10% less effective than an N95 respirator one expert tells CNN but the effectiveness varies based on their ASTM categorization Sachs explains. There are three different categories to choose from with 1 2 and 3 grading masks from least to most protective. The slight difference in efficacy can be resolved by doubling up with a cloth mask — one that's made from at least 3 layers and higher thread counts — atop a surgical mask which ensures it fits perfectly without having to perform an actual fit test.

If you're unable to secure a respirator or do not wish to wear a disposable surgical mask choosing to shop for a better-designed cloth mask is encouraged if you're still holding onto masks made earlier in the pandemic. CDC officials have reported that multi-layered cloth masks made with thicker materials provide better protection compared to ""single layers of cloth with lower thread counts."" Finding these optimized cloth masks from quality retailers is important which is why GH Institute editors have compiled a guide of the best cloth masks.

What's the best mask for children to wear against COVID-19 variants?

Fit and comfort level of a mask or a respirator is crucial when choosing a face mask for a child over 2 years old Sachs stresses. Since kids are wearing a mask for long periods of time at school or around friends she adds that helping your child practice wearing a mask at home is key — you'll want to check on fit so that a mask fully covers both the nose and chin without puckered gaps at the cheeks for starters.

While there are indeed respirators made in smaller kid's sizes these N95s aren't regulated by NIOSH Sachs says. A majority of healthcare providers would also suggest avoiding using a respirator on children if possible as active children can't always keep a proper fit on the mask throughout the day. Most importantly your child may find respirators harder to breathe in compared to medical-grade surgical masks or cloth masks especially during physical activity.

Shop Now: 10 Best Face Masks for Kids

When choosing a cloth mask or a disposable medical mask for your child look for the same qualities you'd look for yourself: How many layers is this mask made with? Will it fit my child loosely or correctly over the nose mouth and chin? Is it made with nonwoven textiles that are easier to breathe through compared to heavier cloth fabrics? And how often will this mask need to be cleaned as well as in which manner? Determining answers to these questions can help you pick out a great face mask for school or extracurriculars — and if you can't answer them when viewing the product online or in the store try finding another option.

How to shop for the best face masks to protect against Omicron:

Keep this shopping checklist in mind when you're on the hunt for a new face mask or respirator.

Consider a respirator or a disposable surgical mask first. There's a reason why healthcare experts at the Mayo Clinic began requiring patients and visitors to wear these medical masks or respirators. There's mounting evidence that these kinds of face coverings are inherently better suited to keep the wearer safe so consider upgrading your mask collection to include these options. Choose a mask that's made from nonwoven textiles when possible. Sachs explains these materials are used in things like tea bags and dryer sheets; woven fabrics on the other hand are made from yarn and are used to make things like bedsheets and should be considered secondary options. Avoid cloth masks that are made from a few layers of knit fabrics as they're not as protective. Look for masks made from multiple layers. Though there are some masks and respirators that have confirmed filtration abilities tied to them don't stress too much about claims of filtration as ""particle filtration"" claims do not always equate to SARS-CoV-2 particles Sachs advises. Rather look for how many layers the mask is made with or if it's made with a filter layer for disposable options. A well-designed cloth mask will have multiple layers for efficacy. Keep an eye out for classifications or certifications. To avoid counterfeits you should always consult NIOSH's full list of approved N95s and triple check the international respirators you're considering as the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) emergency-based approval of these masks in 2021 has now been rolled back. It's more likely that you'll keep an eye out for ASTM standard F3502 which are a benchmark of standards manufacturers use to ensure their masks are effective. In the case of disposable surgical masks you'll look for language that suggests the mask ""Meets ASTM F2100"" level guidelines which is a separate standard for these medical-style masks. Level 3 is the most protective and readily available online for shoppers to purchase now.

Some updates were ripe for the picking — like the new ""plant-based protein"" seal endorsed by Mr. Peanut's signature now displayed on its label.

It's a seemingly straightforward and obvious addition. Of course nuts are plant-based. Yet it is one of several changes Hormel has planned for the brand that its previous owners could have but didn't make.

The Austin Minn.-based food maker closed on its record $3.3 billion purchase of Planters from Kraft Heinz Co. in June and has wasted no time padding Mr. Peanut's pockets with marketing dollars.

""The company has big ambitions for the brand really focused on a growth mindset"" said Rafik Lawendy marketing director for Planters who joined Hormel as part of the acquisition. ""We're extremely excited for the resources the brand will be getting.""

Onlookers agree there's more value to be extracted from Planters. The brand had gone stale despite checking the box on several trends like protein-rich eating and increased snacking habits.

""The Planters brand had really struggled under Kraft and had lost sizable market share — we think Hormel will be successful at turning this around"" said Rebecca Scheuneman an equity analyst at Morningstar. ""Planters will be one of Hormel's largest brands so it will receive some pretty significant attention and marketing support.""

Mr. Peanut and the Nutmobile cruised Burlington Wis. in September. Hormel has “big ambitions for the brand really focused on a growth mind-set” said marketing director Rafik Lawendy.

Refreshed packaging is slowly hitting store shelves in a ""soft conversion"" — old labels are being used up so as not to generate waste said Jeff Frank Hormel's group vice president of grocery products. New flavors and products will be unveiled in the coming months. And last week Planters shot a Super Bowl ad after Mr. Peanut missed the big game last year.

Hormel's long-term challenge will be sustaining that growth for an already ubiquitous brand in crowded snack aisles — or any food segment Planters may try to reach.

""How do we operate as a snacking brand and stretch out of the nut aisle and into different formats and distribution points?"" Lawendy said. ""It's our job to innovate and tell that story to consumers and be there with the right offerings.""

First steps

Hormel's largest acquisition in its 130-year history marks another step away from being a commodity business focused largely on raw agricultural products. For years Hormel has worked to reposition itself as a branded food company. By adding some sort of value to products both profit margins and predictability tend to increase.

Company executives often bristle at being called a meatpacker. ""We see ourselves largely as a protein company"" Frank said.

The acquisition also brings greater distribution in places like convenience stores where Hormel can more easily place its other snack brands alongside Planters products Frank said.

""Snacking companies tend to be really good at salty savory or sweet snacks — we have something in every one of those spaces"" he said. ""Planters really anchors our snacking portfolio.""

Folding Planters into Hormel amid global supply chain breakdowns added a few headaches though peanut prices didn't see the sharp increases other commodities suffered over the past year.

A new Hormel office is being established in Chicago where Planters leadership will be based. Planters production facilities in California Arkansas and Virginia are now ""part of the Hormel supply chain"" Frank said with the finishing touches on the integration still underway.

The Corn Nuts brand which also came with the Planters purchase is now fully integrated and getting a lot of high-level support.

""I'm a fan of a lot of Planters products; the regular flavor of Corn Nuts is at the top of my list"" Hormel CEO Jim Snee said at a Faegre Drinker M&A Conference last fall. ""It has become a staple not only in the car but in my office as well.""

Frank said ""the team has gotten really aggressive around Corn Nuts"" with sales up 24% in the last quarter compared to the same period a year ago before the acquisition.

Next steps

Once Hormel harvests the ""low-hanging fruit"" of rebuilding the brand Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said he'll be watching how Planters competes long-term with store brands.

""How can they reinvigorate growth in that category and get consumers excited about Planters and the nut business in general?"" he said.

Lawendy said nuts should be on-trend for years to come; it's a matter of convincing consumers that Planters are the ""nuts of distinction.""

""The peanut is a beautiful superfood that has a lot going for it from a snacking and sustainability standpoint — it requires very little water"" Lawendy said. ""It's the snacking trifecta — something crave-able good not super processed.""

That ""plant-based protein"" label is increasingly important for Hormel. For a company long known for Spam chili bacon and turkey non-meat products now make up 25% of Hormel's sales.

Morningstar analyst Scheuneman said Hormel is eager to lean into the plant-based trend.

""It makes a lot of sense for them because per capita pork consumption has been declining in the United States as consumers get more health-conscious.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mb29kLzIwMjIvamFuLzE3L3N1c3BpY2lvdXNseS1kZWxpY2lvdXMtdW5kZW5pYWJseS1hc2lhbi1mb3VyLXdheXMtd2l0aC1zcGFtLXJlY2lwZdIBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mb29kLzIwMjIvamFuLzE3L3N1c3BpY2lvdXNseS1kZWxpY2lvdXMtdW5kZW5pYWJseS1hc2lhbi1mb3VyLXdheXMtd2l0aC1zcGFtLXJlY2lwZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The American canned meat that’s undeniably Asian: four recipes with Spam,"There are few food items across the world as divisive as Spam the small can of processed pork that inspires either love or revulsion.

I’m part of the Asian diaspora and for me this very American product tastes like home. The story of Spam in Asian communities is a shared story of resourcefulness and resilience. It’s often difficult to articulate to people as they recoil in disgust that Spam is not only delicious but is also viewed very differently in our parents’ home countries.

I share my love for the small rectangular slab of canned pork with millions of Asians and Pacific Islanders across the globe. The use of Spam is ingrained in the regional cuisines of the Philippines South Korea Japan and Hong Kong which may seem inconsistent with local cooking styles ingredients and techniques. So how did this American tinned meat become embraced by so many cuisines?

Spam and noodles Spam and rice Spam and eggs. Spam has a long history as a convenience product a food ration a luxury item and a leftover from US colonialism. It was created in 1937 by Hormel Foods as a way of turning surplus pork shoulder into profit and to fill a gap in the market for small portions of high quality deli meat with a long shelf life.

At the time other companies were using waste products and offcuts like pork noses to make their deli meat so Spam’s comparative high quality and affordability made it a hit with families struggling through the Great Depression. Its long shelf life and high protein content also made it an ideal military ration. That’s how Spam began its journey around the globe – as a wartime necessity. By the end of the second world war the US government had bought about 68000 metric tonnes of it to feed its army and as aid for its allies.

After the second world war Spam’s popularity waned in Europe but remained hugely popular in the Asia-Pacific. In the Philippines Spam was an expensive commodity sold in retail stores at US army bases with one tin often costing almost an average daily wage. Its price and its overt “American-ness” was a large part of its appeal – having Spam or other imported canned goods in your pantry became a symbol of affluence.

In Hong Kong where agricultural land (and therefore meat) was scarce and manufacturing was booming cafes or cha chaan tengs cleverly combined Chinese cooking styles with luxurious imported foods like Spam butter and cheese creating Cantonese interpretations of western fare for factory workers.

In Hawaii the US military introduced Spam as an alternative source of protein when local people lost access to a major part of their diet with restrictions on Japanese-American off-shore fishing during the war. It now forms an intrinsic element of Hawaii cuisine.

The Korean war took Spam farther east. US soldiers bartered with Spam for information from local people left hungry by wartime shortages. It was also smuggled out from army bases along with sausages baked beans and other canned goods. This period of scarcity gave rise to the now quintessential budae jjigae or “army base stew” the perfect amalgamation of Korean cooking and American ingredients.

I grew up in Singapore eating Spam as part of an “economy/curry rice” offering with noodles or in fried rice and at home where my mum cooked it for us as a treat. Spam is most delicious when simply fried in a pan – salty soft in the middle with crispy golden edges. It’s the perfect textural contrast. When diced and stir-fried into rice or eggs it gives glorious bursts of porky flavour. Simmered it becomes exceedingly tender and absorbs the flavour of the broth making it an ideal ingredient in a decadent spicy stew.

Sure Spam is a relic of American colonialism but it’s also undeniably Asian. It’s a shining beacon of culinary innovation through hardship and represents a complex history across many cultures. It’s also absolutely delicious.

A plant-based alternative

I know encouraging the consumption of a mass-produced meat product comes with huge ethical and environmental issues but Asia’s love for Spam has also given rise to a brilliant plant-based luncheon meat product called OmniPork. It features as a plant-based “Spam” in McDonald’s in Hong Kong and Macau and is even available in Australia. It looks and cooks just like Spam does – so feel free to substitute it in to my favourite Spam recipes below.

Army base stew (budae jjigae)

A rich spicy relic from the Korean war budae jjigae is the perfect fusion of traditional Korean flavours with western ingredients. Korean stews or jjigae are generally served sharing-style at the table over a portable stove but can also be cooked on the stovetop and brought to the table. This is a wonderful dish to enjoy with a group.

For this recipe you’ll need gochujang and gochugaru which are Korean red pepper paste and flakes. Both can be found in well stocked supermarkets and Asian grocers.

Prep 10 min

Cook 15 min

Serves 4-6

For the stew

75g kimchi

½ can (170g) Spam sliced

4 cocktail frankfurt sausages or similar sliced

½ bunch enoki mushrooms trimmed

500ml hot stock plus more to top up

Assemble the ingredients in a wide shallow saucepan in layers starting with the sliced brown onion mushrooms kimchi and sauce. Arrange the spam sausages baked beans and tofu over the top pour the stock over the dish and bring to a boil covered on medium heat. Allow to boil for four to five minutes.

Turn the heat down to a simmer and add the rice cakes and instant noodles without the flavour sachet. Remove the lid and continue cooking. Top with cheese and serve in individual bowls. Add more stock to thin the stew as it continues to cook down.

These potato fritters are enormously addictive. I can eat five or six in one sitting before the guilt kicks in. Use a good all-rounder potato for this dish like a desiree or dutch cream.

Prep 20 min

Cook 20 min

Makes 14 fritters

1kg desiree potatoes peeled

1 can Spam

1 egg beaten

½ bunch parsley finely chopped

3 spring onions green part only finely chopped

3 long green chillies deseeded and finely chopped

Salt and ground white pepper to taste

Vegetable oil for frying

Cut the potatoes into 3-4cm pieces and cook in boiling water until tender.

Strain and steam dry mash and allow to cool briefly. Add the Spam and mash thoroughly then fold in the egg spring onion parsley and green chilli. Season with salt and white pepper to taste.

In a heavy-bottom or nonstick frying pan heat enough oil to reach 3cm in depth.

Shape the mix into patties 5cm in diameter and place directly and gently into the hot oil. Fry for four to five minutes until golden brown and crisp turning only once. Serve immediately.

Spam ‘sisig’

View image in fullscreen Sisig a traditional Philippine dish with a military history can be made easier with Spam. Photograph: Rosheen Kaul/The Guardian

Sisig is a Philippine dish of crispy grilled and chopped pork (usually pig’s head and belly) with chicken livers in a bright and acidic marinade.

Classic sisig features papaya green mango fish and other meats but the modern variety came about from Filipinos cleverly repurposing excess pork from US Clark airbase in Pampanga. Traditional sisig requires several stages of cooking but this recipe only needs one. The flavourful dressing is the perfect match for the fatty crispy meat. Serve on a sizzling hotplate if you have one with plenty of steamed rice.

Prep 10 min

Cook 15 min

Serves 4

2 cans (680g) Spam cut into 2cm dice

½ red onion diced

2 birds eye chillies sliced

1 green chilli sliced

1 tsp fish sauce

1 tsp calamansi lime juice calamansi limes are sometimes available online and from specialty grocers; if you can’t find them – and don’t have a friendly Filipino neighbour to ask – this can be substituted for regular lime

1 tsp white vinegar

1 tbsp vegetable oil

Black pepper

1 egg yolk optional

Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the Spam and fry over medium-high heat until the it is crispy and golden.

Transfer the crispy Spam into a bowl and combine with the diced onion chilli fish sauce lime juice vinegar and season with black pepper to taste. Heat a sizzling plate or pan until smoking add a dab of butter and serve the sisig directly on the hotplate.",,,,,,,,,

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands. Despite a slight decrease in net income from $291 million in Q1 2023 to $272 million in Q1 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc demonstrated a 6.5% increase in total revenues reaching $1471 million. Operating profit surged by 17.3% and the operating profit margin under GAAP improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDAre also saw an 8.8% increase indicating a solid operational performance. The company's strategic divestitures of its interests in European and Asian joint ventures along with other U.S. properties reflect a focused approach to optimizing its portfolio.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4 percent on the property’s 2024 estimated results. Other terms were not disclosed.

The property is expected to be among Host’s top-25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with expected combined RevPAR of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $585502 further improving the quality of the company’s portfolio.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting. Among other amenities the property has a Bamford Wellness spa with six treatment rooms two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space including a 9400 square foot ballroom and 9300 square feet of pre-function space.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTE1Mzc0NTIwL2hvc3QtaG90ZWxzLWJ1eXMtMS1ob3RlbC1uYXNodmlsbGUtZW1iYXNzeS1zdWl0ZXMtZm9yLTUzMC1taWxsaW9uLWNhc2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels Buys 1 Hotel Nashville Embassy Suites for $530 Million Cash,"Host Hotels & Resorts bought the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $530 million in an all-cash deal.

The Bethesda Maryland-based hotel real estate investment trust said in a news release that the price represents a 12.6-times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or a capitalization rate of approximately 7.4% on the property's estimated 2024 results.

Based on recent revelation of HPE’s involvement in Israel’s prison and surveillance systems the movement has called for the reinvigorated campaign. “Let us teach HP and through it all corporate criminals that profiting from war crimes and human rights violations comes at a steep price” the Palestinian BDS National Committee said in an announcement on January 10.

The Committee cited that Who Profits an independent research organisation has revealed that HP Enterprise which was founded in 2015 after the split of Hewlett-Packard Company into HP Inc and HPE continues to provide services to Israeli prisons and police.

According to Who Profits “HPE which specialises in the manufacturing and marketing of storage and server hardware retained several occupation-related involvements through its Israeli subsidiary Hewlett Packard (Israel) Ltd.”

Amid its notable involvement with Israel is HPE’s service to the country from 2017 to 2020 as the sole provider of Itanium servers for the ‘Aviv’ System. The Israeli Administration of Border Crossings Population and Immigration uses the Aviv computerisation system which contains the Population Registry with information on Palestinian citizens and non-citizen residents of occupied East Jerusalem. The System also includes the ‘Yesha database’ which contains information on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank and Gaza settlements Who Profits reported. HPE’s business partner DXC Technology developed operated and maintained this system while HPE itself supplied the required servers for it.

The BDS Committee said this database in Aviv which includes Palestinian citizens and East Jerusalem residents has “facilitated Israel’s efforts to ethnically cleanse and colonize Sheikh Jarrah Silwan and other Palestinian neighbourhoods in occupied Jerusalem.”

The BDS Committee noted that HPE’s contract providing servers for the Aviv System has ended according to a recent Who Profits report. “This achievement comes on the heels of over a decade of effective campaigning against HP by solidarity groups churches unions and progressive city councils across the world” the BDS Committee said.

While celebrating this development after their ’Boycott HP’ campaign and claiming a shift in favour of Palestinian liberation and against Israeli apartheid the movement called for intensifying the BDS campaigns against HP-branded companies due to the recent revelations of the company’s continued involvement with the Israeli government. Referring to the Who Profits report the BDS Committee said “HP remains deeply complicit in Israel’s grave human rights violations.”

Who Profits reports “In 2020 [HPE] was contracted to provide computer and communication maintenance for Israel Prison Service for 2021-2022 for the amount of over NIS 1 Million (>300000 USD)”. In 2021 the company was also given the contract to maintain servers for the Israel Police until 2023 in the amount of NIS 4 million.

Noting that over 500 Palestinian administrative detainees have called for a boycott of Israeli military courts and are mobilising against the policy the BDS Committee said “We are escalating our campaign against HP as part of our commitment to the just demands of the Palestinian administrative detainees and other political prisoners in apartheid Israel’s dungeons.”

Launched in 2005 by 170 Palestinian unions refugee networks women’s organisations resistance committees and Palestinian civil society groups the BDS movement has gained support in its quest to win justice for Palestine.

The ‘Boycott HP’ campaign has grown over the years spreading across the globe and drawing support from major trade unions including the United Kingdom’s second-largest Unite the Union and the Netherlands’ largest trade union federation Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging (FNV) and the Students Federation of India (SFI) which has 4 million members.

Moreover along with prominent churches the city councils of Dublin in Ireland and Portland and Oregon in the United States have also divested from HP companies over their involvement in alleged human rights violations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMi8wMS8xNS9zdWJhcnUtcmV2ZWFscy0xMDczLWhwLXN0aS1lLXJhLWVsZWN0cmljLXRyYWNrLWNhci1hdC10b2t5by1hdXRvLXNhbG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Subaru reveals 1073 hp STI E-RA electric track car at Tokyo Auto Salon,"Subaru took the wraps off the all-electric 1073 hp STI E-RA concept car at this weekend’s Tokyo Auto Salon. And while the STI E-RA might not have much in common with any road-going Subarus that doesn’t mean the concept won’t hit the road.

Subaru says it built the STI E-RA concept to gain “experience and training of new technologies in the world of motorsports in this carbon-neutral era” and the company has its eye on a clocking record-setting 6 minute 40 second lap at the Nürburgring’s North Loop sometime in 2023.

If Subaru hits that mark it will have beaten just about every production-spec internal combustion car that’s ever hit the ‘Ring and a track record set by Tesla’s Model S Plaid last summer… by nearly a full minute. (!)

To help achieve that goal the Subaru STI E-RA concept features GT-style high-downforce composite bodywork that’s wrapped tightly around the wheels. Cutouts in the body help pull air out from the wheel wells and accelerate it towards the towering rear wing which will work in concert with a carbon-fiber splitter up front Formula 1-style bargeboards and (what seems to be) a tall highly-developed rear diffuser.

The Subaru’s roof-mounted intake scoop evokes the iconic WRC Imprezza rally car of the aughts and early 2010s – and presumably feeds air to the 60 kWh battery pack’s cooling system.

It’s got the look

Lots of scoops and body sculpting.

Formula 1 and LeMans-style aero bits.

It absolutely looks the business and – thanks to the 800 kW (1073 hp) Yamaha-developed electric motors powering the all-wheel drive E-RA concept forward Subaru has every chance of meeting its stated performance goals.

Electrek’s Take

Building a wild ultra high-horsepower electric racer and setting it loose on a pack of unsuspecting ICE-powered cars on a historic racetrack has proven to be a popular way to build up a carmaker’s EV credibility. Volkswagen did it when it sicced the VW ID.R on Pike’s Peak and Goodwood as did Lotus Polestar and Porsche for that matter. Subaru’s in good company there.

The real question isn’t about Subaru’s engineering chops then it’s about the brand’s identity. Put simply: can a brand that’s built its identity on horizontal “boxer” engines and mechanical all-wheel drive systems really be the same brand when its electric offerings don’t have any of those things?

This racer won’t answer that question but maybe it will drop enough jaws to build a whole new brand identity all its own.

Electrek reports the automaker has introduced two concept EVs at the Tokyo Auto Salon including its first all-electric race car. The STI E-RA Concept hints at Subaru's upcoming track vehicle with 1073HP of total power from its four Yamaha motors extensive downforce and all-wheel drive mated to a ""unique"" torque vectoring system that maximizes grip and stability.

While the 60kWh battery is relatively small Subaru is confident the E-RA can thrive on the track. It's hoping to set a Nürburgring lap time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds at some point in 2023. That's not as quick as VW's ID.R (6 minutes 5 seconds) but it's comfortably ahead of road cars like Tesla's Model S Plaid (7 minutes 35 seconds). The company plans to test the E-RA at Japanese racing circuits later in 2022.

Subaru

The brand also unveiled a Solterra STI Concept (at middle) that as the name implies is a sportier version of the upcoming crossover. Subaru didn't discuss under-body changes but the upgraded Solterra has a roof spoiler skirt spoilers and other customizations to signal its performance ambitions.

However much the E-RA represents Subaru's motorsport plans it's also serving as a declaration of intent. Like VW's racer it shows the company is serious about EVs and can produce high-performance cars in addition to everyday people haulers. The challenge is to translate lessons learned from concepts like this to regular vehicles. Subaru is late to EVs compared even to incumbents like VW Mercedes and GM and it may need to move quickly if it wants to counter the electrification efforts of its rivals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy90aGlzLTEyMDAtaHAtbWF6ZGEtd2lsbC1oYXZlLWEtZm91ci1yb3Rvci1hbmQtcndkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This 1200-HP Mazda Will Have A Four-Rotor And RWD,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy90aGlzLTEyMDAtaHAtbWF6ZGEtd2lsbC1oYXZlLWEtZm91ci1yb3Rvci1hbmQtcndkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpdmVtZXNwb3J0LmNvbS8xODIwODgzLWdlbnNoaW4taW1wYWN0LTI1LXVwZGF0ZS1zcGlyYWwtYWJ5c3MtbW9uc3Rlci1saW5ldXBzLWFuZC1ocC1sZWFrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Genshin Impact 2.5 Update: Spiral Abyss Monster Lineups and HP (Leak),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpdmVtZXNwb3J0LmNvbS8xODIwODgzLWdlbnNoaW4taW1wYWN0LTI1LXVwZGF0ZS1zcGlyYWwtYWJ5c3MtbW9uc3Rlci1saW5ldXBzLWFuZC1ocC1sZWFrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

LOUISVILLE Ky. — Humana is mourning the loss of their senior vice president.

Thomas Noland 68 died Saturday after a two-year battle with cancer.

He spent more than 30 years with Humana Inc. serving as chief spokesperson of corporate communications often making public and media appearances.

Noland was active in the community and served on numerous boards including the Filson Club Historical Society where he served 5 years as president.

According to his obituary published by Pearson’s Funeral Home family members said Noland will be remembered as “singularly accomplished effortlessly charm­ing invariably supportive persistently cheerful. He leaves a legacy of profound joy.”

A memorial celebration of life will be held for Noland on March 19 at St. Francis in the Fields Episcopal Church at 11 a.m.

In lieu of flowers expressions of sympathy may be made to The Filson Club Historical Society The Louisville Orchestra or The Community of St. Anselm via The Consortium for Christian Unity c/o Barlow Associ­ates Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith Inc. 101 Bullitt Lane Ste 400 Louisville KY 40222

Family and friends are also invited to send written memories of Noland. A selection of those memories they say will be published in a book titled “Remembering Tom Noland” that will be distributed later this year.

This has been critical to help navigate the unprecedented volatility and has accelerated the vision of supply chain executives by 5 to 10 years. We can no longer depend on historical data to make supply chain decisions and looking forward we are not certain how consumer behavior will continue to change over the next few years as we adjust to a post-COVID life. Recent IBM Institute for Business Value research shows just how much has changed in the last two years alone. That’s why it’s critical to look to real-time data and insights to uncover patterns so we can anticipate and take action on what’s needed to best serve retailers and their customers.

Challenge and opportunity

For Party City the global celebrations category leader the pandemic presented a unique challenge and opportunity. With the scaling back of large social gatherings consumers switched to decorating their homes and having smaller-scale events to celebrate momentous occasions and brighten their days. The way in which people shopped also changed. The usual in-store foot traffic was temporarily modified. Party City quickly pivoted to offer safer shopping experiences like home delivery curbside pickup and buy online pickup in store (BOPIS). To continue driving sales while still meeting customer and employee satisfaction Party City needed to simplify their ordering and purchasing processes to provide seamless services to its online and in-store customers.

“The pandemic presented many unique business challenges for retailers and just as consumers have needed to adapt to new ways of shopping it was imperative that we improve inventory turns increase speed and reliability of order fulfillment by removing supply chain friction to help deliver on Party City’s customer promise.

By revamping our end-to-end omnichannel capabilities with seamless integration of our Salesforce commerce platform and IBM Sterling Order Management systems we’re able to power a highly-scalable order orchestration and inventory visibility solution that is helping us continue to successfully pivot towards our next-generation retail format and deliver a blended digital experience.” —Mark Miller Party City CTO

Seeing results

To achieve the desired level of success Party City maintained their business operations by rapidly deploying and scaling new fulfillment capabilities using IBM Sterling Order Management solution IBM Sterling Inventory Visibility to meet shifting shopper demands and expectations in real time. This included adding curbside pickup same day delivery and ship-from-store as well as evolving their retail locations to operate as decentralized fulfillment centers to quickly and cost effectively serve customers as part of their omnichannel strategy and customer experience strategy. Though none of these fulfillment options were available pre-pandemic by the beginning of phased retail re-openings these new channels became critical to their integrated fulfillment strategy and helped covert customers at a rate 75% higher than the previous year.

Along with making ship-from-store and curbside pickup available Party City also created a first for the retail industry with the introduction of self-checkout through the Party City app. This allows customers to shop via the app complete their order transaction and pick up their items without ever having to transact in-store.

Additionally to become more agile responsive and resilient in their back-office processes Party City partnered with IBM Consulting to transform its finance and supply chain operations with technologies like AI and automation. The finance transformation roadmap and organizational design along with the warehouse management strategy is designed to deliver solutions that improve productivity reduce overhead cost and improve service levels to Party City’s suppliers and customers on resilient and integrated platforms.

Adapting and differentiating with innovative technology

Leading retailers have turned to technology to support a new agile way of working responding to the pandemic-related uncertainty in supply and demand. The resulting intelligent workflows help make retail supply chains predictive automated agile and transparent. By modernizing critical supply chain processes with open platforms that take advantage of advanced technologies including AI blockchain IoT and hybrid cloud retailers can quickly deploy new and differentiated fulfillment capabilities that help drive revenue growth and customer acquisition.

As retail clients evolve their digital strategy and shift to integrated resilient and scalable platforms it will help them improve productivity reduce overhead cost and respond to increasing priorities around sustainability. All of this allows leading retailers to provide excellent service to their trading partners and most importantly to their customers.

By contrast she is in colour. She’s also wielding a large sledgehammer – she pirouettes and hurls it at the screen which explodes and everything goes to black. Up comes text and a deep male voice intones: “On January 24 Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh and you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like 1984.”

It is one of the most famous advertisements in history screened just once on national television for 100 million Americans watching that year’s Super Bowl. It announced the arrival of the machine which would change history not just of the industry but our relationship with technology. The Macintosh – the Apple Mac – launched two days later and brought personal computing to the masses.

Child’s play

IT was so easy to operate that a child could do it. “The big difference with the Mac was that a complete novice – indeed children – 10-year-olds five-year-olds who had never seen a computer before – seemed to instantly and intuitively lunge for the mouse” Dag Spicer senior curator at the Computer History Museum in Palo Alto California summed up.

Before the Mac computers were controlled in a language called DOS by obscure typed-in commands like “copy a:\autoexec.bat c:\windows” the letters clicking onscreen in white or green on a black background. The industry was largely controlled by IBM – “Big Blue” – with its $5000 IBM PC XT. At the cheap end there was the Commodore 64 gaming machine if batting a white square ball off a digital wall can be considered a game.

The 30-second launch ad was made by Ridley Scott (with a nod to Fritz Lang’s Metropolis) and the symbolism the subliminal message was that the athlete – 19-year-old Anya Major – represented Apple and Big Brother was the then-dominant IBM. But it nearly didn’t get shown. The Apple board was initially unwilling to fund the $800000 spot in the showpiece football game and the company’s co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had considered funding it themselves.

Wozniak put it this way: “They didn’t like Steve’s [Jobs] personality. Steve would have a vision and they would fight it – they would have a different vision of their own. They just got tired of Steve calling them idiots.”

Eventually the “idiots” backed down and the ad ran.

Scott the lot

RIDLEY Scott was then the most famous and expensive hired hand making commercials. He would later become a director of blockbuster films including Alien and Blade Runner but he learned his skills in advertising.

For the Apple shoot he demanded an actress capable of running up to a huge computer screen turning and throwing the hammer convincingly at the screen. Most of the actresses at the casting call in London’s Hyde Park couldn’t do it. Indeed one nearly felled a pedestrian with the hammer. But Major who was a discus thrower as well as a model won the role because she could.

The shoot on the outskirts of London took three days and the drones the grim marching men were local skinheads paid $25 a day.

They were trouble and on the third day they took to fighting and throwing rocks at each other which didn’t phase Scott. He had what he needed. Two days after the Super Bowl ad the Mac was launched by Jobs to a packed audience in the De Anza College auditorium in Cupertino still the home of Apple.

Looking at footage now it’s almost like a revivalist meeting with cheering crowds people frantically waving arms gasps and minutes of applause as the boxy computer is pulled out of a bag by Steve Jobs who powers it up.

After the swelling music and a few images on the screen a deep computer-generated voice comes in: “Hello I’m Macintosh. It sure is great to get out of that bag. Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking I’d like to share with you a maxim I thought of the first time I met an IBM mainframe: never trust a computer you can’t lift.”

The audience is frenziedly clapping and cheering. “Obviously I can talk but right now I’d like to sit back and listen. So it is with considerable pride that I introduce a man who’s been like a father to me ... Steve Jobs.”

Opening the Gates

IN the packed audience near the back of the hall Bill Gates and a gaggle of Microsoft employees are sitting. They have the message. A year later in 1985 Microsoft launches the first version of Windows having licensed some aspects of the interface from Apple.

Three years later with Windows soaring Jobs and Apple filed a lawsuit claiming that the look and feel of their software had been copied. The action failed and since then graphical interfaces pioneered by Apple have become the standard for computers in homes and offices around the world.

Jobs had brought in John Sculley from PepsiCo as chief executive and he was convinced to put around $80 million behind the launch of the Mac. It was a fateful mistake.

Tensions between him and Jobs were evident so much so that the man who with Wozniak had started the company in his parents’ garage joined the small team developing the revolutionary computer almost as a side project to the main business of the company which was then the more conventional machines.

Jobs wasn’t just a visionary about computers. He realised that software and particularly desktop publishing software would be crucial to success. Adobe’s PostScript Page Description Language which delivered a uniform computer publishing language and fonts came with the Mac.

A year after the hysterical launch in Cupertino in January 1985 Aldus’s Pagemaker debuted on the Mac along with Mac Publisher and Ready Set Go. Jobs’s engineers had also been working on a laser printer and just weeks later the LaserWriter was introduced. Apple had almost single-handedly created the desktop publishing market. The Mac became the favoured machine of graphics departments marketing divisions schools small businesses and book and newspaper publishers.

The cult of Jobs

STEVE Jobs’s relationship with Sculley was in meltdown however and in September 1985 he left having cashed in stock options of $21.43m. He set up his own computer company NeXT which was not the success he imagined. But he did hit the gold seam and become a billionaire by investing in the struggling George Lucas start-up Pixar Animation Studios which became stratospherically successful with the film Toy Story.

More than a decade later in December 1996 Jobs returned to the company he formed when he sold NeXT to Apple for $400m and after the worst quarter results in its history became first interim CEO and shortly after the permanent boss.

The UNIX-based operating system he developed at NeXT laid the groundwork for the OS X operating system which Apple continues to develop. The PowerBook the iMac the MacBook Air and clutch of computers followed and in 2007 the product which would take Apple to the top of the corporate ladder and become by far the richest company on the planet the iPhone. Jobs died of pancreatic cancer in 2011.

Without him and the talking 17lb computer with the nine-inch screen he pulled out of the sack onstage almost 40 years ago there would have been none of that.",,,,,,

Advantages of cfRNA for noninvasive health monitoring Circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA; also called C-RNA) is a promising alternative for noninvasive assessment of health. Unlike DNA a cell's RNA transcriptome is dynamic and tissue specific. cfRNA is released by various tissues into circulation via the cellular processes of apoptosis microvesicle shedding and exosome signaling. cfRNA is also stable contained within vesicles that protect it from degradation by nucleases. Because of its diverse origins cfRNA measurements reflect tissue-specific changes in gene expression intercellular signaling and the degree of cell death occurring within different tissues throughout the body (Figure 1).5-9

Figure 1. Circulating cfRNA can be obtained from a standard blood draw and reflects molecular changes in all body systems.

Optimized protocol for cfRNA library preparation and sequencing While cfRNA has high informative potential it does have practical challenges. Each milliliter of plasma yields only a few nanograms of cfRNA which is a mixture of full-length RNA and fragmented RNA. The most abundant transcripts present in human blood are ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and globulin RNA which can overpower the signal of more informative transcripts. To address these issues our research team at Illumina developed a workflow that was amenable to the low yield and partially fragmented nature of cfRNA. Rather than use standard depletion methods to remove rRNA we generated a library from all cfRNA and carried out probe-assisted enrichment targeting the whole human exome. The optimized workflow for cfRNA sequencing maximizes exonic cfRNA signal minimizes risk failure for low-input samples and is compatible with overnight shipment of blood samples at room temperature. The original protocol used ligation-based library preparation to generate high-quality whole-transcriptome cfRNA sequencing data.1 Further development efforts showed that tagmentation-based RNA library prep kits enable even greater sensitivity and throughput for the next wave of research (Figure 2 Figure 3).10

Figure 3. Illumina RNA Prep with Enrichment shows decreased noise for low-abundance cfRNA transcripts than with the ligation-based protocol.

Proof-of-concept study to identify cfRNA signatures in early-onset preeclampsia Our recent Science Translational Medicine publication described how we established and applied this workflow in a proof-of-concept study to identify cfRNA alterations associated with the dangerous pregnancy complication preeclampsia.1 The team collected 113 blood samples including 40 from women with severe early-onset preeclampsia and 73 from women with healthy pregnancies. Aided by machine learning adapted to clarify trends in sometimes noisy data we discovered a cfRNA signature that captures the dysfunction of diverse body systems and accurately classifies preeclampsia status across independent cohorts. We identified 30 transcripts in circulation that were differentially abundant compared with noncomplicated pregnancies. These transcripts had gene ontology annotations and tissue expression patterns consistent with the placental dysfunction impaired fetal development and maternal immune and cardiovascular dysregulation characteristic of preeclampsia. (Table 1).

Highlights of identified circulating transcripts associated with preeclampsia The cfRNA changes we observed in preeclampsia patients matched the biology of the disease and corroborated the validity of this approach. Of the 30 identified gene transcripts over half were previously associated with preeclampsia (Table 1).11-29 The altered cfRNA transcripts captured information from multiple different organ systems representing contributions from maternal placental and fetal tissues. For instance we identified dysfunction in the placenta as well as altered blood pressure regulation in the mother. The following gene categories highlight specific examples of the impaired biological processes captured by cfRNA. IGF signaling: impaired fetal growth and development Preeclampsia is associated with low levels of bioavailable insulin-like growth factor (IGF) which is a major regulator of fetal growth and development.30-32 IGFBP5 PAPPA2 HTRA4 and PRG2 are all relevant to the regulation of IGF signaling and were found to be increased in early-onset preeclampsia subjects. Pregnancy duration: risk of preterm delivery CRH ZEB1 and PNMT genes associated with pregnancy duration and the onset of labor33-35 were upregulated in preeclamptic cfRNA. Preterm delivery is a common outcome of early-onset preeclampsia and nearly all affected participants in this study delivered prematurely. Angiogenesis: compromised placental development Ten transcripts identified in this study are important for angiogenesis regulation: APOLD1 LEP SEMA3G ADAMTS1 TIMP3 ADAMTS2 HTRA4 HSPA12B SLC9A3R2 and TIMP4. Angiogenesis is a crucial component of proper placental development throughout gestation but is impaired in preeclamptic pregnancies.3637 Blood pressure regulation: hypertension Hypertension is a defining symptom of preeclampsia. Multiple transcripts associated with blood pressure regulation ALOX15B PNMT ARHGEF25 APOLD1 and CRH showed elevated levels of cfRNA transcripts in this cohort. Dendritic cell activity: impaired pregnancy immune tolerance Immune system dendritic cell markers also exhibited anomalous expression in preeclampsia patients: CLEC4C PLD4 TIMP3 and VSIG4. Dendritic cells play a key role in the immune system’s tolerance of the placenta and fetus in pregnancy and have been implicated as a potential driving factor behind preeclampsia.38-40

As unsurprising as ever it seems DRM is once again causing problems for users who just want to play content they’ve already paid for.

As explained by Bleeping Computer blu-ray discs have digital rights management in place that requires support for SGX otherwise known as software guard extension. Intel’s SGX is hardware-based memory encryption that’s baked into the chips. It allows code to be separated into different levels of security making some more private than others. As Intel is removing SGX from it’s 11th and 12th Gen desktop processors they will no longer be compatible with these discs for 4K playback.

Your next upgrade (Image credit: Future) Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD

Best graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits

Best SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the rest

According to Intel’s data sheets for 11th and 12th generation chips SGX has been moved to deprecated technologies meaning it will no longer be used. And sure it sounds like a bit of a kick in the teeth for anyone wanting to play their 4K blu-rays on a PC but the move makes a lot of sense due to how bad SGX could sometimes be.

Not only is SGX proprietary to Intel causing developers to need to specifically design for it as opposed to other more flexible systems. Over the years multiple vulnerabilities were found within SGX that allowed for many attack methods. Even as recently as last year researchers found a new attack method dubbed SmashEx. In short it seems SGX just isn’t worth the trouble anymore.

Most of the PCs I’ve come across over the past few years don’t even have a disc drive so it’s an understandable move from Intel. However it’s still worth noting for anyone looking to put together a new PC they expect will be able to do it all when it comes to home entertainment. If you’re looking to play blu-ray discs at 4K resolution you may want to stick with that older chip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vaW50ZWwtYXRsYXMtY2FueW9uLW51Y3Mtd2l0aC1qYXNwZXItbGFrZS1sYXVuY2hlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Atlas Canyon NUCs with Jasper Lake Launched,"About a year ago Intel launched its 10nm Jasper Lake Atoms. These Atoms are on a newer Intel process and feature the new Tremont core. One of the stranger parts of this launch is that it happened with basically no fanfare. While the leaks of the new line occurred in May 2021 along with many headlines of the Intel NUC 11 Essential kits coming soon it took until January 2022 for these NUCs to hit launch.

Intel Atlas Canyon NUCs with Jasper Lake Launched

A quick check on the Intel Ark comparison view shows that these kits are now in the “Launched” status with “Q1’22” as the date only about two weeks into the quarter.

As one can see these units have the new 10nm Atoms with the Intel Pentium Silver N6005 and N5105 being quad-core units and the 10W Celeron N4505 being a dual-core unit.

We did a piece on Intel Tremont Low Power Architecture Detailed back in 2019 just for some sense of how long the wait has been.

One of the big advancements was in the performance per core of these lower-power parts.

Here is the block diagram for Tremont from that 2019 piece:

While many of our readers prefer higher-power NUCs these are the NUCs that start to compete as a step above the Raspberry Pi boxes but below some of the higher-power NUCs and Project TinyMiniMicro 1L PCs.

Final Words

At this point let us face it what we really hoped to have tried at this point is the Snow Ridge Atom P5962B 24-core part. Since it is looking less likely that that will ever happen perhaps the next closest thing for a low-power Atom node will be these NUCs. Hopefully the Intel NUC 11 NUC11ATKPE becomes available soon so we can get one to try out. It would be great to try one of these Atlas Canyon NUCs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbC1jZWxlcm9uLWc2OTAwLWFsZGVyLWxha2UtY3B1LXN0dXR0ZXItYWFhLWdhbWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's Celeron G6900 Alder Lake CPU Struggles In AAA Games,"Earlier in the week we reported how the new Celeron G6900 from Intel's 12th Generation Alder Lake family matched the Core i9-10900K (Comet Lake) in single-threaded performance. In addition the Geekbench benchmark results highlighted the punch of the new Golden Cove cores. However it is much better to see and test processor performance in the real world and Steve at Random Gaming in HD (RGIHD) has obliged with a nine-game test suite.

To recap the Intel Celeron G6900's specifications it has two Golden Cove cores and no Hyper-Threading. It runs at 3.4 GHz with 4MB Smart Cache and 2.5 MB of L2 cache. The processor supports up to DDR4-3200 or DDR5-4800. Intel's UHD Graphics 710 iGPU has up to a 1.3 GHz boost and 16 EUs. This Celeron has a 46W TDP.

As he was testing the base model in the Alder Lake lineup which cost £55 (MSRP $42 in the US) Steve saw it to match it with the cheapest Intel LGA1700 motherboard he could find the Gigabyte H610M S2H DDR4 for which he paid £80 (about $110). The RAM quantity wasn’t skimped upon for a budget build with 16 GB (8 x 2 DIMMs) of DDR4-3000.

He didn’t say anything about the storage but the GPU in the system for game testing was the Nvidia T1000 a creator-focused card with very similar specifications to the GTX 1650. In a previous video RGIHD said he picked up this T1000 as it had better availability/pricing than the gamer/consumer-focused GTX 1650. So it might be the same for you depending on your region.

The system as mentioned earlier was tasked with a decent range of popular games new and old using sensible quality settings.

The results showed The Witcher 3 at 1080p high with an average of 43 FPS marred by lengthy intermittent freezes which couldn’t accurately qualify as stutters – these pauses were far too long (1% low 0 FPS)

In GTA San Andreas at 1080p high the system achieved an average of 58 FPS and the glitches and slowdowns were much more bearable (1% low 15 FPS).

For Cyberpunk 2077 playing at 1080p low in the Badlands we saw an average of 47 FPS 1% low of 11 FPS). However this game has a bigger problem as it will not load save games when this lowly 2C/2T processor is your CPU. It is hard to complain about this “bug” as the Celeron is two cores short of the minimum specced CPU.

The YouTuber ran CS:GO at 1080p low settings on the Dust II map. The average in-game performance was 120 FPS (1% low 42 FPS) so performance was much more respectable.

Steve went on to test Fortnite Forza Horizon 5 (hangs at loading screen) GTA 5 Far Cry 6 (so slow it is unplayable) and Red Dead Redemption 2 ran at an average 34 FPS using 1080p “console settings.”

A common observation throughout the testing was that the Celeron held this system back in gaming. If you flick through the video you will often see CPU utilization at or near 100% while the GPU isn't really under duress (unless it is in Cyberpunk 2077). The system is not balanced for gaming.

To conclude his exciting insight into the G6900 Steve indicated that there wasn't much point in going for this latest-gen Celeron over any previous-gen entry-level Intel processor that is still available due to the higher motherboard costs at this time. However on an optimistic note RGIHD intends to look at the new Pentium Gold G7400 which Steve will be testing with the iGPU as well as an appropriate discrete GPU. The Pentium has several upgrades over the Celeron including its 2C/4T configuration a faster clock speed of 3.7 GHz and double the Smart Cache.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY3dvcmxkLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzU2MzU3MS9pbnRlbC1hbWQtbnZpZGlhLWNoaXBzLWFwcGxlLXNpbGljb24tbWFjb3MuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel AMD and Nvidia want to beat Apple silicon. Here's why they won't,"Once upon a time you could watch a keynote presentation from any major computer chip company and rest easy in the confidence that the name “Apple” would never pass the lips of any presenter. The message always seemed to be as per the classic Mad Men meme “I don’t think of you at all.”

But oh how the tables have turned. With the transition to Apple silicon well underway and the debut of the high-powered M1 Pro and M1 Max chips last summer major players in the silicon market are hastening to not only mention Apple but to prove how much better their latest products are than that computer company that nobody used to care about.

This past week’s Consumer Electronics Show was a news cavalcade for the likes of Intel AMD and Nvidia all of whom took their time to reassure the vendors that rely on them that yes they could play in the same league as Apple.

Intel me no secrets Intel you no lies

Perhaps none of these three protested so vociferously as Apple’s most recent ex-partner Intel. The company took the wraps off its latest series of laptop-bound processors the Alder Lake series including a top-of-the-line model that it described as “the fastest mobile processor. Ever.” And in the truest press conference braggadocio Intel put out the benchmarks to drive home that fact showing its Core i9-12900HK processor just edging out the M1 Max in some tests and handily surpassing it in others.

Of course if we took every benchmark chart from every manufacturer at face value our brains would go up in a puff of smoke like an evil robot. And given that these chips will probably never make their way into a Mac we are probably stuck with apples-to-oranges (if you’ll pardon the expression) comparisons.

Sure the Alder Lake performance looks impressive. but did anyone else notice the amount of power Intel’s chip consumes compared to the M1 Mac? Sure the Alder Lake performance looks impressive. but did anyone else notice the amount of power Intel’s chip consumes compared to the M1 Mac? Intel Sure the Alder Lake performance looks impressive. but did anyone else notice the amount of power Intel’s chip consumes compared to the M1 Mac? Intel Intel

But even before we get to that point there’s an important factor in one of Intel’s own charts: impressive though the Core i9-12900HK processor may be its power consumption is much higher than the M1 Max starting just below that chip’s 35W and climbing all the way to around 75W. Putting that chip in a MacBook Pro would mean a lot of design tradeoffs that Apple wouldn’t be willing to make even in the name of more power.

Graphic content

But computer processors aren’t the only industry where Apple’s silicon advances are firing shots across the bow. One of the big stories with the M1 Max and M1 Pro is their graphics performance. In the past Apple has worked with both major graphics card companies AMD (which acquired GPU company ATI back in 2006) and Nvidia—both of whom are taking shots at Apple this year with varying degrees of obliqueness.

Nvidia often considered the graphics card behemoth to beat boasted during its CES keynote that laptops using its new RTX GPUs are “up to seven times faster” than a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Max. Except several of the tools for which Nvidia provides benchmarks have either only beta support for running natively on Apple silicon or no support at all. Others benchmarks such as the Blender Cycles package that showed the biggest difference don’t currently support Apple’s Metal graphics framework potentially putting them at a big disadvantage at the moment.

AMD meanwhile at least took aim at the power efficiency of Apple’s chips claiming that some laptops using its new Ryzen 6000 chips can get up to 24-hour battery life—though that is specifically for video playback. (To be fair Apple cites similar caveats in its own battery performance.)

AMD claims 24-hour battery life (video playback) is possible with its new Ryzen 6000 chip. Apple claims 21 hours of Apple TV playback with the M1 Max AMD claims 24-hour battery life (video playback) is possible with its new Ryzen 6000 chip. Apple claims 21 hours of Apple TV playback with the M1 Max AMD AMD claims 24-hour battery life (video playback) is possible with its new Ryzen 6000 chip. Apple claims 21 hours of Apple TV playback with the M1 Max AMD AMD

Apple’s not the only competition for these two graphics heavyweights though. Intel decided to stick its own toe into the GPU business this year with a new series of discrete graphics cards called Arc. With Intel on one side and Apple on the other—not to mention continued supply chain woes that have made graphics cards scarce—both AMD and Nvidia are likely to be feeling the squeeze this year.

Walking away with it

How did this all happen? Did Apple just walk into yet another industry and sit down as the titan?

Granted it’s hard to consider Apple the underdog these days when its market capitalization is flirting with $3 trillion but let’s dispense with the myth that these silicon advances are things that Apple’s just pulled out of its hat. The company spent the last decade carefully designing and continually improving the processors and graphics chips for its mobile devices before finally implementing that technology in its desktop and laptop computers.

It acquired companies that specialize in silicon from the PA Semi purchase in 2008 that laid the groundwork for Apple’s processors to picking up parts of Dialog Semiconductor in 2018 and invested heavily in graphics tech firms like Imagination Technologies. And moreover it’s optimized for a specific case: the best performance it can get at the lowest power consumption.

With 45 years under its belt Apple’s become a master of playing the long game and strategically investing in key technologies then nurturing them over the course of years. So what looks like an amazing magic trick is actually the result of long periods of hard work—propped up by a whole lot of money.

All of that said let’s not forget that performance isn’t the only reason people choose to use a Mac over a PC. Many consumers aren’t likely to switch no matter how much power Apple can bring to bear—the gaming market on the Mac for example has never been comparable to the PC. And even if Apple silicon performance is eventually outclassed there will always be those that simply prefer the experience of the Mac.

But at least as it stands now you can get the joys of that experience and the satisfaction of knowing that your platform’s the one to beat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZWwtcmFwdG9yLWxha2UtaHVnZS1jYWNoZS11cGdyYWRlLWZvci1nYW1pbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Move Over 3D V-Cache Intel Raptor Lake Could Pack A Huge Cache Upgrade For Gaming,"



Even after all of our refinements to the technologies; even despite innumerable advancements the single biggest bottleneck for superior CPU performance is still simply getting data into and out of the CPU. That fact was brought into sharp focus with the release of AMD's Zen 2 CPUs  which offered drastically-improved gaming performance over their Zen+ predecessors largely due to their massive L3 cache.

AMD's been leaning hard on the cache play recently; not only did the company ship graphics processors that are heavily reliant on large near-GPU caches for high performance but the red team's response to Intel's Alder Lake snatching away the gaming performance crown was to slap an extra 64 MB of L3 cache on its fastest single-threaded CPU. It remains to be seen who's the real victor in that fight but the approach stands in stark contrast to Intel's idea of simply ramping up clock speeds to the sky

The possible layout of purported 68MB Raptor Lake cache. Credit: Olrak on Twitter



Well it looks like Intel sees at least some merit in AMD's approach—at least if the latest leaks on Twitter are to be believed. Largely-anonymous leaker OneRaichu tweeted vaguely at first saying that ""68M cache is interesting.😄"" OneRaichu clarified in a later tweet that he was talking about Intel's 13th-generation Raptor Lake's total L2 and L3 cache.The image above is a die shot of Intel's Alder Lake-S silicon used in the Core i9-12900K Core i7-12700K and Core i5-12600K among other CPUs. You can clearly see illustrated that Alder Lake includes 1.25 MB of L2 cache for each Golden Cove P-core and a shared 2MB of L2 cache for each cluster of four Gracemont E-cores. Each section (P-core and E-core cluster) also gets 3MB of L3 cache totaling 14 MB of L2 and 30 MB of L3. reply in the thread from Twitter user ""ns4e921"" gives an idea of the possible layout of this 68 MB of cache on Raptor Lake: 2*8+4*4+3*12. Applying that formula to the expected layout of Raptor Lake gives us eight Raptor Cove cores with their own 2 MB of L2 cache four E-core clusters with 4 MB each and twelve sets of 3MB L3 (one for each core or core-cluster.)If you're confused check out this diagram by Twitter user Olrak where he helpfully laid things out. It also makes a nice comparison against the Alder Lake shot above. Assuming this information is accurate we're looking at a 60% increase in L2 cache for the P-cores and double the L2 cache for the E-core clusters. The L3 cache per object seems to remain the same although the two extra clusters of E-cores raise the total amount of L3 cache to 36 MB.This latest information lines ups neatly with earlier rumors that Intel's Raptor Lake would feature increased L2 cache and E-core allotments over its 12th-generation Alder Lake CPUs so we find little reason to doubt its veracity. Still given that this is a leak and not an official release take it with however many grains of salt that you wish.Intel hasn't made any official announcement regarding Raptor Lake or its launch window although leaked roadmaps pegged it for 2022 and earlier leaks suggested we'd see it in Q3 of this year. That might be pushed back a bit depending on how the market goes though; after all Intel just launched its mainstream Alder Lake desktop parts two weeks ago  and AMD has its Zen 4 ""Raphael"" waiting in the wings  too. Naturally we'll let you know the score as soon as we do."

Simply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

The global exchange traded fund industry not only attracted record inflows it also racked up extraordinary growth in the breadth and depth of its offering last year.

An overall total of 1503 ETFs and exchange traded commodities were launched far ahead of the previous record of 873 recorded in 2018 according to data from Morningstar.

Just 264 ETFs were liquidated or merged out of existence down from 510 in 2020 and the lowest figure since 2014 when the industry was a fraction of its current size. The low closure rate meant net growth in the ETF count of 1239 was almost twice the previous record of 656 set in 2010 when the industry was just getting into its stride Morningstar’s data suggest.

The expansion comes as ETFs attracted more than $1tn of fresh cash in a calendar year for the first time in 2021 taking total assets to more than $10tn according to ETFGI a data consultancy.

“The market and the [ETF] structure just seems to be getting hotter as a destination for money” said Eric Balchunas senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

“[In the US] flows were 80 per cent beyond their old record last year and launches 60 per cent. That is definitely correlation/causation” said Balchunas who argued that the strength of both flows and net ETF launches were driven by strong financial markets.

However Kenneth Lamont senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar said the drivers of launches were different in each market.

“In Europe most new launches have been ESG [environmental social and governance] and/or thematic. In the US the story is different where more than half of launches have been active ETFs.”

The impact of robust markets was perhaps felt most keenly in the paucity of fund closures.

Recent years have seen a steady rise in the number of ETFs being culled a trend that was increasingly seen as inevitable as the industry matured. The more ETFs there are the more that will be liquidated every year if a fixed percentage fail to meet the $50m-$100m asset threshold typically needed to be profitable.

Yet closures slowed to a trickle in 2021 particularly in the second half of the year when just 102 ETFs bit the dust.

Balchunas said this was a byproduct of the market being “so agreeable last year borderline utopia” with the S&P 500 rising 27 per cent.

In the US 70.4 per cent of ETFs took in money in 2021 according to Bloomberg data the highest percentage in the modern era.

“It wasn’t just the one thing that was working” Balchunas said. “It was almost like the fish were jumping into the boat last year. It was just such a favourable year that there was no reason to close anything.”

Peter Sleep senior portfolio manager at 7 Investment Management said last year’s strong backdrop “potentially turned marginal funds into profitable funds” with market gains attracting inflows “as money chases performance”.

Those funds that were pulled included a number of eurozone government bond ETFs where yields have fallen to exceptional lows said Sleep.

Among the 144 equity ETFs that drew their last breath were 15 domiciled in and investing in China. This tally included six that were only launched in 2020 and extraordinarily three that debuted in June or July 2021 only to be liquidated in November or December demonstrating the often fickle short-term nature of Chinese investors and fund managers.

When it comes to launches Sleep pointed to the proliferation of ESG versions of pre-existing investment themes as well as an increasing taste for thematic investment as factors behind the upsurge.

Of last year’s new ETFs 131 expressly included “ESG” in their name while 21 claimed to be “sustainable” and a further eight “Paris-aligned”.

In the US launch activity was turbocharged by mutual fund managers taking advantage of the relatively new freedoms to launch portfolio-shielding semi-transparent or non-transparent ETFs enabling them to run actively managed vehicles without revealing their “secret sauce”.

“There is a big structural change that is driving activity in the US with active managers relaunching the same or a similar strategy in a different wrapper” argued Lamont who said 60 per cent of US launches last year were actively managed.

He also noted that in an industry traditionally concentrated on North America Europe and Japan “developing markets are also responsible for many of the new launches”.

“China in particular has seen a large number of new ETFs coming to market the majority of which are highly targeted sector or thematic exposures which hints at how ETFs are being used there” Lamont said.

Morningstar’s data point to 281 equity ETFs being listed in mainland China last year all of which invest domestically. The vast majority target specific sectors or themes ranging from robots and virtual reality to livestock breeding and comics and games.

However Sleep forecast that one trend in launches in 2022 could be for ETFs that allow foreign investors to steer clear of the Chinese stock market an option that proved popular last year for the few funds that facilitate it.

Sleep also predicted the launch of more carbon offset battery and green bond ETFs this year.

“We have seen lots of ESG equity but as firms issue more green bonds we could see more ESG green bond ETFs” he said.

Balchunas foresaw the launch of more ETFs aimed at “older investors who are a little bit uneasy about how much the market is up” such as buffered funds that offer some downside protection in exchange for capping the potential upside.

That is unheard of.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd2picS5jb20vaG93LXRvLWZpbmQtb3V0LWhvdy10aGljay10aGUtaWNlLWlzLW9uLW1haW5lcy1sYWtlcy1hbmQtcG9uZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How To Find Out How Thick the Ice is on Maine's Lakes and Ponds,"I'm not a big fan of winter mostly because of the nuisances that come with it. Shoveling snow icy walkways cars not starting. One thing I do enjoy though is ice fishing but I actually don't do the fishing. I leave that up to my friends and sit in the warming hut having a few drinks and waiting for a flag to pop up.

My son loves it. He'd fish all day if I let him. I still love his reaction from the time we went ice fishing when he was 9 and the first fish was pulled out of the hole in the ice on Keoka Lake in Waterford.

It got me wondering while we were out on the lake just how thick does ice have to be to be safe? You don't want to end up losing your car or worse a person on thin ice so here are some general guidelines from the Maine Warden Service on how thick ice needs to be on a lake to be able to be safe.

For new clear ice 2 inches or less is dangerous. STAY OFF the ice!

4 inches might be safe for ice fishing and other activities on foot.

5 inches is good for snowmobiles and ATV's.

8 to 12 inches of good ice will support most cars or small pickups.

12 to 15 inches will usually hold a medium-sized truck.

While this information is very handy just how can you verify how thick the ice is?

If you have an ice auger you can dig a hole and find out for yourself otherwise ask someone. Local fishermen or bait and tackle shops near the lake you want to go on can tell you. Even a local convenience store might be able to let you know how thick the ice is. If in doubt stay off.

It's also a good idea not to drive your car or truck on the ice if you have any doubts about the thickness of the ice whatsoever. You don't want your car to go into the lake as so many did in Lake Geneva in Wisconsin back in 2016.

Kayhan which is financed by the office of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is one of the most radical hardliner newspapers in Iran. Its chief editor is also appointed by Khamenei.

Khamenei’s official website on Thursday posted the video showing the assassination of former President Donald Trump on a golf course.

The animation shows an all-terrain vehicle with an operator on board driving through a golf course and approaching a point from where its camera shows a man who looks like Trump playing golf. The operator targets the figure and a large gun on top of the vehicle aims at the target and the video ends.

Khamenei and top civilian and military leaders have repeatedly said they will avenge the killing of Qasem Soleimani the Iranian military and intelligence operator who organized and controlled anti-Western and anti-Israeli militant groups in the Middle East. Trump ordered his killing in early 2020. He was one of Khamenei’s most trusted people.

Of some 23 notes in the running for awards from the IBNS or the IACA only two notes were mentioned by both groups including Mexico’s 20-peso commemorative note for the 200th anniversary of independence.

Award season is in progress for more than just the movies as two paper money organizations one for collectors and the other for professionals have released lists of nominations for outstanding bank notes of 2021.

The International Bank Note Society and the International Association of Currency Affairs focus differently. The IBNS issues a single award the Banknote of the Year for new notes that have artistic merit imaginative design and new security features. IACA’s Excellence in Currency Awards cover three categories — best new bank note or series best new commemorative or limited circulation bank note and best new currency innovations.

Only two notes out of 23 were mentioned by both: Mexico’s 20-peso commemorative note for the 200th anniversary of independence replicating an anonymous painting of the entrance of the army into Mexico City on Sept. 27 1821; and Azerbaijan’s 50-manat note dedicated to education and the future showing children stairs as a symbol of rising the sun standing for power and light and chemical and mathematical elements symbolizing science.

The notes being considered in the IACA balloting are:

Best new bank note or series: Costa Rica Series B 2000- 5000- and 20000-colon notes the Azerbaijan 50-manat note Mexico’s 1000-peso note and Qatar fifth series 1- 5- 10- 50- 100- 200- and 500-riyal notes.

Best new commemorative or limited circulation bank note: Namibia’s N$30 note for the 30th anniversary of independence Mexico’s 20-peso note for the independence bicentennial Guatemala’s 20-quetzal note celebrating the nation’s independence bicentennial Indonesia’s 75000-rupiah note for 75 years of independence and Singapore’s $20 bicentennial note.

The only candidate in IACA’s best new currency innovation category was Honduras and G+G/Louisenthal for their 200-lempira note and registered security thread.

The IBNS entrants besides Azerbaijan and Mexico thus far are: China’s 20-yuan Olympic commemorative note with figure skaters the Cook Islands $3 note with a woman riding a shark England’s Alan Turing £50 note Kazakhstan’s 20000-tenge note Macao’s 20-pataca note for the Beijing Olympics Oman’s half-rial note with wildlife Peru’s 100-sol note Romania’s 20-lei note featuring the first real woman to appear on its currency Sao Tome and Principe’s 200-dobra note Saudi Arabia’s 200-riyal note and the Royal Bank of Scotland’s £50 note with Flora Stevenson.

The IBNS is still accepting nominations from its members at banknoteoftheyear@theibns.org. The winner is usually announced in the spring.

IACA delegates will vote to select the winners which will be announced on Feb. 22 in conjunction with The Banknote and Currency Conference in Washington D.C.

A Campaign analysis of Bloomberg data shows a strong recovery from the pandemic drove up share prices by double-digit percentages across the agency sector last year after the advertising slump in 2020.

IPG which reported organic revenue growth during 2021 that was well ahead of 2019 levels saw a 59% increase in its share price to $37.60 and the US-listed group ended the year with a valuation of about $14.75bn (£10.8bn).

IPG’s total shareholder return (TSR) – a key measure for investors because it also includes dividend payments – rose 65% during Philippe Krakowsky’s first year as chief executive and Michael Roth’s final year as chairman.

Publicis Groupe was the next best performer as its share price rose 45% to €59.20 valuing the French company at €15bn ($17.1bn or £12.6bn). TSR was up 51%.

WPP was close behind as its share price rose 40% to £11.20 giving the British company a valuation of £12.9bn ($17.7bn). TSR was up 44%.

Publicis and WPP’s share price performances were almost identical at constant currency levels which take into account the euro’s decline of about 5% in value against sterling in 2021.

Omnicom which suffered the steepest organic revenue declines in 2020 and recovered more slowly than its three biggest peers in 2021 saw its share price increase by 17% to $73.70 and TSR by 22%.

Omnicom’s relative weakness resulted in the US-based holding company losing its crown as the world’s most valuable agency group as it slipped to third place by stock market capitalisation during autumn 2021 and ended the year with a $15.6bn valuation.

Publicis Groupe and WPP overtook Omnicom by market cap during autumn 2021 – with WPP pulling ahead as the biggest by stock market capitalisation by the year-end.

Overall the combined value of the big four agency groups – WPP Publicis Groupe Omnicom and IPG – increased by more than one third to reach $65bn Campaign estimates.

“A way forward for the agency holding company model”

Japan’s Dentsu the fifth largest agency group which struggled in the run-up to the pandemic and during the 2020 slump also did better in 2021 as its share price rose 34%.

Havas the smallest of the big six agency groups does not have a stock market listing because it is a subsidiary of French media giant Vivendi.

S4 Capital one of a new breed of digital-focused “challenger” groups saw its stock price rise 26% in 2021 after a strong 2020 when it increased about 150%.

M&C Saatchi was one of the best-performing small agency groups last year doubling its share price to 168.5p after drawing a line under an accounting scandal that dogged the company for nearly 18 months. Vin Murria the top shareholder subsequently made a takeover approach at the start of this year.

Many investors were bearish about traditional agency holding companies in the run-up to the pandemic and at the start of the crisis but revenue from advertising and marketing services held up better than expected and agency groups were able to speed up restructuring simplify operations and cut costs.

In an interview with Campaign in December Krakowsky said of IPG's sustained growth: “Our performance in the last few years has been the indicator that there might be a way forward [for the agency holding company model].”

It’s Dolo 650 which has clocked sales of Rs 567 crore during the pandemic from March 2020 and topped the charts so much so that it’s being called a “favourite snack” as India grapples with the third wave of Covid. #Dolo650 trended on social media in a meme-fest all last week.

New Delhi: You thought Crocin was the go-to paracetamol tablet for a headache body ache or fever? You thought wrong.

— Yogesh Dhameliya ? (UR) (@YoDha_16) January 8 2022

But what’s the magic behind this pill that gets doctors to prescribe it?

A glance at the paracetamol sales data from January 2020 revealed that Dolo 650 has been one of the dominant players till now followed by Calpol and Sumo L. In all there are 37 brands of paracetamol that are top-sellers in different regions of India.

Data with IQVIA a human data science and advanced analytics firm in healthcare shows that Dolo and Calpol are the key brands driving the paracetamol segment. While Dolo 650 is manufactured by Bengaluru-based Micro Labs Ltd Calpol is manufactured by GSK Pharmaceuticals. Each of these brands has regional dominance and is widely prescribed by doctors.

Dolo 650 clocked sales of Rs 28.9 crore in December 2021 up 61.45 per cent from the same month the previous year. However its highest sales figures are from April and May 2021 at the peak of the second wave of Covid when it witnessed sales of Rs 48.9 crore and Rs 44.2 crore respectively.

In comparison sales of Calpol — the second most sold paracetamol brand in December 2021 — stood at Rs 28 crore up 56 per cent from December 2020. Calpol was the most sold paracetamol at the peak of the second wave with Rs 71.6 crore in sales in April 2021.

Other popular brands of paracetamol include Fepanil P-250 Pacimol and Crocin.

Why Dolo 650?

Doctors and pharmaceutical associations told ThePrint that one reason behind Dolo 650’s success is the fact that it’s still a medicine that doctors prescribe unlike Crocin.

Moreover doctors prescribe Dolo 650 as it can be given to people of all ages and has minimal side effects.

“Dolo 650 is one of the brands of paracetamol which is a time-tested and common medicine to treat fever. It is no different from other brands like Crocin Calpol Pacimol etc. It’s a relatively safe medicine and can be taken by people of all ages and by those suffering from heart disease kidney disease and diabetes” said Dr Ritesh Gupta additional director at the Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases in Delhi.

Dr Gupta said the main symptoms of Covid in the third wave are fever cough throat pain and body ache. The symptoms are mild and usually resolve in four or five days.

Anil Navandar who is general secretary of the Maharashtra State Chemists & Druggists Association said Dolo 650 has become a brand whose name is used interchangeably with paracetamol itself — just like Bisleri or Xerox for their respective products — and therefore has a strong recall value.

“There is a trend of having paracetamol in case of mild fever and bodyache. The way Bisleri has become a huge brand Dolo 650 has become a brand. In fact it has become a trend for this segment” said Navandar.

Who manufactures Dolo 650?

Dolo 650 is manufactured by Micro Labs Limited a Bengaluru-based privately held firm that was founded in 1973 by a pharmaceutical distributor G.C. Surana. The company is currently run by his son managing director Dilip Surana.

Its core areas of expertise include cardiology diabetology ophthalmology and dermatology among others. Apart from Dolo 650 the company also sells brands such as Amlong which is used to treat high blood pressure and the anti-diabetic drug Tenepride.

According to the company’s website it has an annual turnover of Rs 2700 crore which includes exports of Rs 920 crore.

Jan. 25 the course will land its highest honor.

Sweetgrass will be named National Golf Course of the Year in Orlando that day joining such venerable venues as Pebble Beach Golf Links and Georgia’s Reynolds Plantation. It will become the sixth Michigan course to achieve that honor from the National Golf Course Owners Association.

The Jemsek National Course of the Year Award is based on outstanding contributions to its community exceptional quality of the course exceptional quality of ownership and management and significant contributions to the game.

“We were all just speechless” said Sweetgrass director of golf Dave Douglas. “We are very honored to win that award.”

The Island Resort & Casino is operated by the Hannahville Indian Community of the Potawatomi Nation and just recently opened a $33 million expansion as part of an 11-story Palm Tower that expands lodging capacity to 454 rooms and includes the Horizon Steakhouse and Splash Island a new family waterpark.

General manager Tony Mancilla said the expansion was developed out of necessity noting demand and a lodging backlog on weekends that extended to 150 to 200 people.

“Golf (lodging) was getting crowded out (by other activities)” acknowledged Mancilla.

“Hannahville has always strived to be the best and offer the best” said long-time Tribal Chief Ken Meshigaud. “We’re very proud (of the award). We know we have the product to offer that people will be pleased with.

“We are very pleased with what it has done for our facility and the central U.P. We have always given accolades to our staff. What a fantastic group we have there. It shows Hannahville tries to do the best in anything we do.”

Meshigaud said the Sweetgrass development in addition to the 2018 opening of nearby Sage Run Golf Course “is one of the most beneficial additions. It has made quite an impact.”

Sweetgrass had been named Michigan’s course of the year for Region 2 last fall putting it in line for the national award. Other regional honorees were vaunted Streamsong Red of Bowling Green Fla. in Region 3 Swansea Country Club of Swansea Mass. in Region 1 and Silverado Resort in Napa Cal. in Region 4.

The NGCOA’s board of directors then selected Sweetgrass as the Jemsek National course of the year.

“This was a bonus for us” Mancilla said of the national award. “It is pretty neat. Michigan has so many great courses. That was pretty much our goal (state award). We were excited about that (just being considered for the national award).”

Mancilla will attend the Orlando awards program with Douglas Scott Herioux and John Holberton.

Previous Michigan winners of the national award were Stoatin Brae of Augusta in 2021 The Heather at Boyne Highlands in 2019 Forest Dunes in Roscommon in 2016 Scott Lake Country Club in Comstock Park in 2012 and Fox Hills Golf and Banquet Center in Plymouth in 2003. Another previous Michigan state winner was TimberStone Golf Course of Iron Mountain.

Among other past notable national recipients are the Pete Dye Course in French Lick Ind. World Tour Links in Myrtle Beach S.C. and Atlantic Dunes by Davis Love III in Hilton Head S.C.

Sweetgrass was nominated by Kevin Frisch of Gaylord who owns a public relations firm that has worked closely with Island Resort & Casino over the years.

Mancilla said hosting the Symetra Tour since 2011 has been a major boost for women’s golf with ticket sales reaching $4000 annually. That profit goes to the YMCA of Delta County for its’ youth programs.

“That (Symetra Tour) has really promoted women’s golf” Mancilla said noting Sweetgrass and Sage Run are also used for Upper Peninsula high school finals golf tournaments. “The more you grow the more it benefits everybody” said Mancilla. “We are on a good trajectory.”

The tribe donates a practice round and the finals day to the preps.

Frisch said he nominated Sweetgrass because “of the quality of the golf course. They base the criteria on the quality ownership and management and contributions to the community. What they have done with the Symetra event what they do to give back to the community. Everything around it warranted the nomination. I felt it would be a perfect nomination well deserved. They do an incredible job.”

Frisch said Sweetgrass’ selection “further solidifies the quality and quantity of good golf in Michigan.

“It really sets it apart from other places. It is always in great condition. The quality of maintenance really sets them apart.”

He also said the green complexes “are really cool. You always walk away thinking about the green’s complexes. They are always in great condition.”

The greens which are heavily contoured and usually quite slick stand out because of their unique variety. The No. 15 island green is probably the most memorable hole as it is very visible – and intimidating – from the eighth and 12th tee boxes. The 12th is a biarritz green with a valley in the middle that has generated several aces during the Symetra tournament.

No. 4 is a difficult redan green requiring a tough 5-iron or 3-or-5-wood approach to a long narrow green sloping down sharply from front to back.

The complex on 9-and-18 is also memorable as the large green shaped like the Upper Peninsula is connected. Those greens are switched for the Symetra tourney with the normal No. 9 serving as the decisive final hole.

Five former Upper Peninsula highway bridges — topped by the former Nahma bridge on No. 15 – are standouts on the Sweetgrass course. Another course highlight is the environmentally reclaimed water filtration system that pumps water into the ponds on nos. 9-18 which Frisch noted in his nomination.

The architect of Sweetgrass is Paul Albanese of Albanese & Lutzke Golf Designs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ubHlpbnlvdXJzdGF0ZS5jb20vbWljaGlnYW4vdW5kZXJyYXRlZC1zbm93LXR1YmluZy1taS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Is One Of The Best Places For Snow Tubing In Michigan,"Snow Tubing in Michigan

What are some nice ski resorts in Michigan?

So Michigan isn’t exactly known for its plentiful slopes like say Colorado – but don’t let that fool you! Don’t be lulled into the assumption that Michigan winters are dreary and cold (though they ARE cold). This state can be a winter wonderland if you know where to look and we’re home to some top-notch ski resorts – that's a start right? Some of our favorite ski resorts in Michigan include the famous Big Snow Resort which is famous for... well it’s snow. With an average snowfall per year of more than 17 feet this snowy paradise is a winter lover’s best friend. There’s also the one we just discussed – Boyne Resorts – that we’re major fans of. We also love Crystal Mountain which has earned the accolade of being in the top ten best family ski resorts in the country. We are inclined to agree; there’s so much to do there that no matter what your kiddos’ skills might entail they’re sure to find something to enjoy.

Where can I find good snow tubing hills in Michigan?

As long as you’re creative you can find bunches of great places to go snow tubing be they at a designated area and/or resort or one you find yourself. Some of our favorite places to go tubing in Michigan include the aforementioned Boyne Resorts (of course) and Hanson’s Hills in Grayling are pretty amazing too! Other locations we like are the epic getaway in Traverse City – Timberlee Hills – that just so happens to be THE largest in the state and in Milford you’ll find that Kensington Metropark has some great options for sledding tubing and more. Bundle up and get outside; Michigan is beautiful year-round but winter seems to take on a special magic.

At the end of the opening eight minutes of play the scoreboard read 4-3 in favor of the Eskymos. However once the second quarter began the Flivvers and Mos each put up five points within the first minute of play as Mari Bink hit a three — her first of five on the night — and Katelyn Stalboerger put up two for Escanaba while Abby Terrian and Paige Olsen scored two and three respectively for Kingsford. The remainder of the quarter the Eskymos would outscore the Flivvers 9-2 and never look back.

“After the first quarter I think we had four points and they had three. But I felt we were doing the right things” said Escanaba coach Mike Beveridge. “We were making good passes they were doing the right things and I knew it would take a little time for that to drop. Once it started dropping then we could go. And I really felt that’s where we were at so I wasn’t too worried about the four points. I’m just glad they only had three.

“What I saw was my girls playing together looking for each other and that was more important than the score. Everything else took care of itself.”

Beveridge was also pleased with how well his team played defensively.

“I thought our defense was stellar tonight. Our defense was real tough” he said. “We did a couple different defenses and kept them off guard. But the girls played real hard defensively and that was a win.”

Offensively Escanaba spread the ball around nicely with three players in double digits and several more contributing throughout the night.

Bink had 19 including five triples on the night Kiera Maki had 11 and freshman Grayson LaMarche had a career-high of 10.

Stalboerger had eight points and maintained a defense presence all night with several blocked shots and passes.

For the Flivvers it was their first game in nine days and only second since Dec. 20. Head coach Jon Lorenzoni felt this may have played a factor in the team’s performance.

“I thought at the start of the game we did not execute well at all” Lorenzoni said. “… We hadn’t played in a while. We did have a game last week but with the Christmas break and a lot of practice we just seem rusty. It took us a while to get the cobwebs off.”

The shaky start Lorenzoni added was compounded going into the second quarter. Despite coming up short however he was happy with the defensive play out of the Kingsford girls.

“We missed a lot of free throws early one. We missed some bunnies early on and it snowballed in the second quarter” he said. “Defensively I thought we played well for the most part. We held them to 20 points in the first half which (Escanaba) is a pretty good team. I thought the effort was good. It’s just a matter of making shots and executing our offense a little bit better.”

Olsen collected 14 for the Flivvers with Terrian (8) Laura Bracket (7) Elaina Bortolini (4) and Talia Wallis (1) putting up points as well.

The Eskymos pulled away late in a close JV game that ended 48-42.

Next up for the Mos is another road trip this one to Menominee on Monday to play the Maroons.

The Flivvers on the other hand return home to Kingsford to host the Ishpeming Hematites Tuesday.

But as always his roots remain just across the state line.

""I still maintain an official residence in Arkansas in the house that my grandparents built on the farm in the early 1950s"" he says. ""I've found it very enlightening to keep one foot in Arkansas and one in Missouri one foot in the rural Ozarks and one in the region's largest city.

""Like most college professors my typical day varies greatly depending on whether classes are in session and what season of the year it is"" Blevins explains. ""This winter my typical day starts two hours before sunup with a 30-minute workout. If weather permits I take a 10-mile mountain bike ride at daybreak and then my dad and I feed our cows. I'm usually in my writing shed by 9 a.m. where I spend the day writing researching working with my online class and class prep for my in-person class. Depending upon my schedule I spend a day or two each week on campus in Springfield.""

The author or editor of nearly a dozen history books Blevins' most recent release ""A History of the Ozarks: Volume 3"" was recently published by the University of Illinois Press. He's currently working on ""a couple of short article-length projects -- one from the Civil War and the other set in the 1920s -- and I'm preparing a collection of essays for publication by the University of Arkansas Press in a year or so. I'm also looking forward to diving into a book-length project on the history of migrant workers (apple knockers cotton pickers etc.) from the Ozarks in the 20th century.

""I can't remember not being interested in history"" Blevins says. ""I grew up on my family's little farm in rural Izard County surrounded by the farms and homes of many extended relatives. Stories of the old days and long-gone old-timers seemed to surround our lives. It's what motivated me to explore the history of my native hills and to try to go beyond the myths and superstitions that dominated depictions of Ozarkers.""

Blevins took a few minutes to answer these questions about his work.

Q. Talk about how the series came to be? What inspired it how long have you been working on it have they all been published by University of Illinois Press?

A. I first had the idea of a comprehensive history of the Ozarks back in grad school in the '90s but quickly realized that was much too weighty for a doctoral dissertation. After I finished my book ""Ghost of the Ozarks"" in 2012 I decided to tackle that comprehensive history. I originally planned on a one-volume work but I reckon you could say I overdid it with the research and ended up with the unusual three-volume history instead -- all of them published by the University of Illinois Press.

Q. What do you think surprised and delighted ""lay"" readers in the first two books? And what do you suppose will surprise and delight readers in this book?

A. The part of Volume 1 that generated the most feedback was the section on Native Americans in the Ozarks especially the ""Immigrant Indians"" who were pushed into the region from east of the Mississippi River and who attempted to convince the U.S. government to turn the Ozarks into an autonomous Indian-controlled nation in the 1820s. Needless to say that didn't happen though the failed effort did inspire the government to create Indian Territory in modern-day Oklahoma. I don't think I've received a lot of ""delighted"" feedback over Volume 2. Slavery and the Civil War era aren't exactly fun reads. Probably the most common comment I get on Volume 2 is disbelief and despair over just how brutal the Civil War was in the Ozarks -- and amazement that the violence continued for so long after the official end of war in 1865. Re: Volume 3 I think the story of the ""Ozark Jubilee"" TV show in Springfield will surprise and delight a lot of people. The stories of the rise of tourism in the region -- especially Branson -- and the late 20th and early 21st century blossoming of Northwest Arkansas into a major American commercial hub is another crucial story.

Q. Talk generally about the myth of the Ozarks versus the reality of the Ozarks? How has that affected the growth and development of the region in positive and negative ways? How is it changing now?

A. From at least the early 1900s the dominant image of the Ozarks was a land of hillbillies living behind the times. It could be a positive or negative image depending on who was doing the telling. Folklorists travel writers and regional boosters -- people like Vance Randolph Otto Ernest Rayburn and Marge Lyon -- were primarily responsible for the creation and perpetuation of these stereotypes which then influenced tourism especially in a place like Branson. The image of backwardness also fed into the region's emergence as a great supplier of folk music and other folk products in the years after World War II. But the images whether positive or negative also obscured the real lives of most Ozarkers for generations since the stereotypes were based on a relatively small subset of the population the kinds of rural backroads people who fascinated Vance Randolph and others looking for an alternative to the standard American story.

Q. What would you say to someone in Mongolia or the wilds of Africa -- or the wilds of NYC -- to describe the Ozarks?

A. For the most part the story of the Ozarks is just a regional variation on the American story. Our past shares more in common with general U.S. history than it differs from it. It doesn't mean that the Ozarks lacks color or character -- or that life in large stretches of the Ozarks hasn't lagged about a generation behind the mainstream American story for much of the past century or so. It just means the Ozarks and Ozarkers were never quite as exotic as they were made out to be.

Q. In the past 130 years what are the events that were pivotal in making the Ozarks what the region is now?

A. Harold Bell Wright's popular novel ""The Shepherd of the Hills"" in many ways first introduced the region to the nation and the world. It also provided the early impetus for the Branson tourism industry which has obviously been another of the big stories of the past century. Few Ozarks stories have been more crucial than the transformation of Northwest Arkansas over the past half century. Walmart Tyson J.B. Hunt and other major corporations have combined with the University of Arkansas to make the area the most affluent and dynamic part of the region as well as the most racially and ethnically diverse. Ozarkers from other parts of the region will probably be surprised to read about the changes that have taken place in the Fayetteville-to-Bella Vista corridor just in the past few decades.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

From thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5 Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand soaring 2022 earnings estimates and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares retail investors could jump in at any time.

This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

As these entities along with municipalities and cities prioritize building resilience microgrid solutions are gaining traction.

At their core microgrids are analogous to back-up generators for a local power system. At a deeper level a generator controller must balance the generation output to the load in real-time and serve as a balancing authority to control voltage and frequency not unlike the larger grid operator.

These microgrids are typically operated in parallel with the local grid to provide additional supply surety complicating the generation balancing approach. Microgrid owners possess the assets and must control the grid with technology engineering and operations to manage the generation and distribution in order to maintain the supply both with and without grid support.

MITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

As the world transitions from carbon-intensive fossil resources to a greener electric grid the shift to date has been led by solar and wind renewable resources. Unfortunately these resources do not produce energy when called upon but rather when the wind blows or the sun shines.

Developing a microgrid solution with limited dispatchable resources requires careful attention to the potential energy available either in fuel resources (typically carbon-based) or in large scale stored energy that can be dispatched to respond to load needs in real-time. With the use of a storage-only solution designs can be flexible and respond to load but only allow a definite time of emergency response capacity without external grid support.

As such resilient microgrids require a fossil-based anchor resource to ensure reliability. While fossil resources aren’t usually known for being environmentally sound potential impacts can be optimized through thoughtful application of a combined heat and power system.

These systems are often found in locations where a predictable demand for heat energy coincides with electrical demands such as higher education or healthcare campuses. Combined heat and power systems provide resilient efficient thermal and electrical energy for campuses both during steady state and emergency conditions.

An additional approach being deployed to minimize the carbon impact of microgrids applies fossil-based flexible resources that are future-proofed to plan for deployment of hydrogen fuel in a traditional fossil resource. Many manufacturers are already developing these hydrogen-capable solutions and as the hydrogen economy and infrastructure mature over the coming years the solutions may be able to transition from fossil through a blend with hydrogen to eventually a pure hydrogen (zero carbon) application.

WITHSTANDING UNPREDICTABLE WEATHER

As with any power system microgrid systems are vulnerable to extreme weather and climate events and must be weatherized adequately and prepared for a full range of weather and system conditions.

For example in early 2021 according to Johns Hopkins the state of Texas faced its coldest winter weather in more than 70 years and simultaneously experienced statewide utilities failure. When temperatures in Texas dropped lower than temperatures in Alaska more than 4.5 million homes and businesses lost their power and at least 70 people lost their lives.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) manages the flow of electric power to more than 26 million Texas customers—representing about 90 percent of the state’s electric load. As the independent system operator for the region ERCOT schedules power on an electric grid that connects more than 46500 miles of transmission lines and 710-plus generation units. The uncharacteristically Arctic temperatures exposed the weaknesses in an electricity system designed when the weather’s seasonal shifts were more consistent and predictable—conditions that most weather experts believe no longer exist. As a result ERCOT relied on rolling blackouts.

Experts recommend rolling blackouts as a last resort when power demand overwhelms supply and threatens to create a wider collapse of the whole power system. Usually utilities black out certain zones before cutting off power to another area. Luckily hospitals fire stations water-treatment plants and other key facilities are typically spared. But as many Texans experienced the blackouts can be devastating for residential neighborhoods during extreme weather.

UNIVERSITIES LEAD THE WAY

During the entire winter storm event the microgrid deployed at the University of Texas at Austin was able to maintain electrical supply heating and even cooling for a 20-million-sf campus with buildings for research housing dining and healthcare. This advanced microgrid is one of the most efficient in the world having had only four outages in the last 54 years. The university’s ability to remain operational provided life-saving heat to students who live on campus and minimized damage from frozen assets in buildings.

UT’s microgrid is currently fueled by natural gas. The University is integrating on-campus solar thermal and solar PV resources as well as investigating adapting these generation resources to blend and convert to hydrogen over time.

In New Jersey Princeton University had a similar success story with its microgrid in the wake of Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The campus leveraged its microgrid to sustain operations through the unpredictable storm and provide safe refuge. Its system combined a heat and power system based on natural gas. The University is currently integrating renewable resources and optimizing the deployment of fossil assets to minimize the impact without sacrificing resilience that the system affords.

Both success stories stem from clients that were proactive in investing in resilient on-campus generation sources that were optimized to steady state operation but flexible enough to deploy without-grid connectivity. The heat and power solutions paid for themselves through their energy savings and provided incalculable value from inherent resilience.

In 2020 net zero carbon commitments roughly doubled with many countries embracing the opportunity to deliver “green stimulus” to support economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Microgrids can help deploy more zero-emissions energy sources make use of waste heat reduce energy lost through transmission lines help manage power supply and demand and improve grid resilience to extreme weather.

Here are some tips for firms and their clients that are considering microgrids:

•Develop Transit Resilience

Dynamic and sometimes dangerous weather events are increasingly creating challenges to power grids and consequently to the populations served by them. Crippling events like Hurricane Irma Superstorm Sandy and Winter Storm Uri highlight the importance of resilient power to keep transportation systems running during widespread disturbances. Microgrids can help keep transportation systems powered and moving delivering not only first responders to an area but also evacuating people from the affected region particularly in areas that rely heavily on public transit.

•Plan for Decarbonizing Microgrids

Microgrids must be able to respond to massive dynamic loads particularly for rail and mass transit. These dynamic loads put stress on generation systems that must operate without the utility grid. Carbon (and nuclear) sources are adept at responding to rapidly changing load profiles. However with the increased push for decarbonization these sources aren’t always viable solutions. Inverter-based generation lacks inertia requiring separate energy storage to respond whereby fossil resources have both dynamic inertia and can respond with greater or lesser fuel. It’s important to understand how taxing the load is on the microgrid to ensure that the proposed solution is flexible enough to adequately respond to the load dynamics.

•Microgrids and CHP Systems

Combined heat and power (CHP) can offer a cost-effective way to simultaneously produce power and heat with the heat used for district heating (or cooling) applications and the electricity to be used on-site. To truly capitalize on the efficiencies of CHP it should be applied in situations that have a direct need for heat (or cooling) and sufficient electrical load for the generation solution sized for the thermal load. For example heating and powering a research campus such as UT Austin provides a steady thermal load with a deep electrical load. Through careful planning and thoughtful investment the UT CHP microgrid is flexible enough to respond to changes in electrical and thermal loads independently while also boasting one of the most efficient CHP systems in the world.

•The Hydrogen Solution

Hydrogen infrastructure is in its infancy. Current large-scale hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming which is not a “green” process. Even though this is currently the most effective way to secure large-scale hydrogen “grey” hydrogen still releases carbon into the atmosphere. Current research is pushing new technologies including pink hydrogen produced by high temperature electrolysis at nuclear generation facilities various forms of storage in salt caverns or liquefication advanced electrolyzers fuel cells solid state hydrogen fuel cells and power-to-hydrogen-to-power applications.

Cost-competitiveness is also a consideration: for example the U.S. Department of Energy has a target of $1/kg of hydrogen as an R&D goal. As hydrogen becomes available greener and cost competitive solutions for microgrids will include new fuel cells and gas turbine generators that can run on 100 percent hydrogen fuel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVud2ljaHRpbWUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9qZWZmamFjb2JzL2FydGljbGUvSmVmZi1KYWNvYnMtV2UtbmVlZC1tb3JlLWFuc3dlcnMtd2hlbi1pdC1jb21lcy0xNjc4MDQ1Ny5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeff Jacobs: We need more answers when it comes to the death of Teddy Balkind,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.greenwichtime.com/sports/jeffjacobs/article/Jeff-Jacobs-We-need-more-answers-when-it-comes-16780457.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVud2ljaHRpbWUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9qZWZmamFjb2JzL2FydGljbGUvSmVmZi1KYWNvYnMtV2UtbmVlZC1tb3JlLWFuc3dlcnMtd2hlbi1pdC1jb21lcy0xNjc4MDQ1Ny5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9zYXJhLWphY29iLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyMjU1MTY50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sara Jacob Obituary (1980 - 2022) - Simsbury CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/sara-jacob-obituary?id=32255169 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9zYXJhLWphY29iLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyMjU1MTY50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjaWFsYXBwZWFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvY29sbGVnZS9tZW1waGlzLXRpZ2Vycy9iYXNrZXRiYWxsLzIwMjIvMDEvMTUvbWVtcGhpcy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLXdpdGhvdXQtZGVhbmRyZS13aWxsaWFtcy1sYW5kZXJzLW5vbGxleS1hbmQtbW9yZS12cy1lY3UvNjU0MTIxMzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Landers Nolley Jayden Hardaway out Memphis basketball has 6 scholarship players vs ECU | Source,"The good news: Earl Timberlake will be available for Memphis Saturday at East Carolina.

The bad news: The Tigers will be as short-handed as ever.

Penny Hardaway's team (9-6 3-2 AAC) will still be without leading scorer DeAndre Williams while guards Landers Nolley II and Jayden Hardaway – both dealing with right knee issues – will also sit out the game versus the Pirates (10-5 1-2) according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. Memphis will also not have Alex Lomax who is missing his fifth straight game due to an ankle problem nor forward Chandler Lawson who hasn't played since going down with a sprained ankle on Nov. 24.

All the injuries mean Memphis will have just six scholarship players available for Saturday's game (3 p.m. ESPN+. Senior guard Tyler Harris who has made two starts this season is a walk-on and will play against ECU. Other walk-ons on the Tigers' roster include guards Connor Glennon (junior) and Tadarius Jacobs (freshman). Glennon and Jacobs have played in two games each this season (N.C. Central and Saint Louis). According to the pregame radio broadcast Jacobs will be available in an emergency situation.

Timberlake a sophomore guard left last week's win over Cincinnati due to concussion protocol and was held out of this week's loss at UCF for the same reason.

Timberlake who also sat out the Dec. 14 win over Alabama with an ailing knee is averaging 6.2 points and 3.9 rebounds a game. He has made six starts this season.

Memphis will start freshmen Emoni Bates Jalen Duren and Josh Minott junior Lester Quinones and Timberlake against ECU according to Memphis' pregame radio broadcast.

Jacob Olvera Schott Obituary,"M. Jacob Olvera Schott 12 years old. Passed away December 29th 2021 in a tragic car accident in the Utah Arizona border.

Jacob was born July 14th 2009 in Provo Utah. He was raised in Springville Utah until the 4th grade. Jacob had many interests. He enjoyed participating in the church and school programs; playing with his cousins and going to the pool; doing outside activities like going camping to the lake or just hiking where he developed his love for collecting rocks; playing Pokémon and collecting cards was a big interest of his. In 2019 after traveling every school break his family moved to their family ranch in Stockett Montana. There his life blossomed even more developing an extraordinary love for growing plants taking care of his chickens ducks cats and 4-H steers. He was an active member of the 4-H Eden Livestock club raising his first steer Twinkle Toes as well as participating in many other learning and social activities. He attended Centerville School and enjoyed making friends. He always had a smile or some comment to make them feel loved and cared. He loved to share cookies or Takis with his friends. At Centerville he learned to play the clarinet and saxophone. We already miss listening to him practicing in his room. He also participated in football and more recently cross country with his older sister. Jacob loved to spend holidays together as a family. He also couldn't wait for birthday celebrations to see what kind of cake his aunt Tina was going to make. He loved traveling and making new memories. He fell in love with the beauty of the beaches in Hawaii. Jacob also liked to collect stuffed animals paintings drawings and knives. He was always proud of living on a ranch and his Hispanic heritage. Besides his extraordinary sense of humor he was a big business kid. Early as the second grade he was renting out his Pokémon cards. He would auction off his own paintings. He always had a new plan in mind of how to make money. We are going to miss him planning our family movie nights from making the invitations and signs for popcorn. These are the precious memories that we will cherish forever in our hearts.

Funeral services will be on Saturday January 15th 2022 at 11:00 am at the Stockett Community Bible Chapel. 42 Front St Stockett Montana.

Followed by a memorial reception at the Sand Coulee Fire Hall 571 E Hunter Rd Sand Coulee Montana.

We would like to thank family friends and community members who have reached out to help and make sure our family is doing well during this difficult time. We would also love to give a special thanks to Trooper Thomas Callister from the Arizona Highway Patrol who was one of the first respondents on the scene for going above and beyond by providing our family with peace and support throughout this difficult time."

Four men in black tactical gear pinned him his face to the concrete to cuff his hands behind his back.

He did not resist. He couldn’t. He was so gravely dehydrated he would be dead by their next shift change.

“I didn’t do anything” Mr. Johnson moaned as they pressed a shield between his shoulders.

It was 1:19 p.m. on Sept. 6 2019 in the Danville Correctional Center a medium-security prison a few hours south of Chicago. Mr. Johnson 21 and serving a short sentence for gun possession was in the throes of a mental collapse that had gone largely untreated but hardly unwatched.

He had entered in good health with hopes of using the time to gain work skills. But for the previous three weeks Mr. Johnson who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia had refused to eat or take his medication. Most dangerous of all he had stealthily stopped drinking water hastening the physical collapse that often accompanies full-scale mental crises.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvc2VhbmRncmFoYW0uY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcm9nZXItam9obnNvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Lane Johnson Obituary 2024,"Garner NC: At 5:14AM on May 5 2024 Heaven gained another angel when Roger Lane Johnson age 72 known to many as “Rog” or the “Running Man” won his battle with cancer.

Roger was born March 11 1952 to the late Robert Hite and Pearl Estelle Coats Johnson of Garner NC. In addition to his parents he is also preceded in death by his brother Bob Johnson of FL; his sisters Rose Jordan of FL Lois Jean Taylor of FL and Sylvia Thrower of MD. Roger was survived by many nieces and nephews; and great nieces and nephews; and to Cindy and Nancy; yes it is possible to have true love more than once in your life.

From the mailroom to a nuclear specialist Roger worked for Carolina Power and Light for 25 years. He would later do contract work for Duke Energy.

Roger was an avid and talented runner motorcycle enthusiast and photographer for many tee-ball teams along the way bringing smiles to parents faces. He was born and raised and lived in the Cleveland School Community and was known and loved by many. Roger was lovingly known as the “Running Man!” Roger who didn’t know a stranger made and kept lasting friendships along the way leaving a lasting impression as to the kind of person he was. He especially had a soft spot in his heart for the elderly and children. He brightened the lives of everyone around him. Roger’s legacy of love kindness and generosity will never be forgotten. Roger’s passing leaves a gaping hole in our lives.

Thanks to all of Roger’s friends who he considered brothers; you brought much joy into his life. Thanks to Tim Farish and Family for all your help and support these last 2 months.

A Celebration of Life will be held at a later and time.

The family appreciates your thoughts and prayers.

The star has 'mountains of public goodwill' to offset negativity ...,"Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s nice guy reputation has been taking some hits — but the “mountains of public goodwill” he’s built over the years should outshine the drama an expert tells Yahoo Entertainment.

A recent report from the Wrap saw more than a dozen people who worked with Johnson on the upcoming holiday action-comedy film Red One criticize his “chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set.”

Insiders claimed the Black Adam actor — who co-stars alongside Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons — “was late an average of seven to eight hours per day and missed several entire days of production” resulting in the movie running at least $50 million over budget. They pointed fingers at the film’s “inexperienced” lead producer Hiram Garcia who is Johnson’s ex-brother-in-law and ex-personal assistant for letting things spiral. An insider called the situation “a f***ing disaster” and claimed “Dwayne truly doesn’t give a f***.”

Sources claimed Johnson’s lateness is a pattern saying he had a “huge fight” with an “infuriated” Ryan Reynolds after showing up five hours late to the set of their movie Red Notice in 2020. There’s also a wild story about him urinating in water bottles (something he previously copped to doing).

A spokesperson for Amazon MGM the film studio behind Red One denied the claims in the report calling Johnson and his production company Seven Bucks “incredible partners.” Johnson insiders told the outlet he “averaged no more than one hour late” and “the budget did not deviate much from the agreed-upon figure.” Johnson’s rep did not respond to Yahoo’s request for comment.

Despite the scathing report a crisis and PR expert doesn’t expect this to cause lasting damage to Johnson’s reputation.

“There is a better chance of Martians landing on the lawn of the Biden White House than this ever permanently hurting the Rock” Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants tells Yahoo.

What’s going on with Johnson?

In addition to being one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood Johnson is one of the most likable celebrities — and a large part of that is due to his strong work ethic. Johnson brands himself as a hard worker — his Instagram with 397 million followers shows a dizzying schedule of gym time movie shoots meetings adorable girl dad moments and philanthropy.

Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks is a nod to his bank account balance when he was cut from a pro football team at age 22. It made the then broke star pivot to a career in wrestling rising through the ranks at the World Wrestling Federation (later called World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) before crossing over to Hollywood and starring in the Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises. In 2016 Forbes listed Johnson as the highest-paid actor and currently estimates his net worth at $270 million between his movies production company wrestling endorsements and brands. A key part of his success is being able to connect with the masses but not forgetting his roots which is why many want to see him run for president.

It seems that over the last year-plus however there have been some negative headlines. The biggest prior to now was in September when he and Oprah Winfrey faced backlash after asking people to donate to their Maui wildfire fund — instead of giving more of their own money. He acknowledged the criticism and he and Winfrey quietly donated more than they had pledged.

The drama has been simmering elsewhere: His bankability took a small hit with 2022’s Black Adam which didn’t perform as well as anticipated and he faced criticism over how he handled it. The Wrap story also seemed to confirm that Johnson attempted to have his production company take over the DC films universe in 2022. It didn’t happen and Johnson going around others for the secret meeting didn’t sit well. Variety reported on that in 2023 with an insider saying Johnson’s “demands” — including having his brand of tequila served at a premiere of PG-13-rated Black Adam — “increased and the returns just weren’t there.”

This year Johnson made a big return to WWE and was appointed to the board of its parent company TKO but he was booed by fans for being almost two hours late to an April event. Recently he’s been hamming it up to play the villain in the pro wrestling storyline. The same week the View audience jeered the mention of his name for saying he won’t be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. (He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but said he learned that sharing his political opinions only causes division.)

The Wrap story has brought back into conversation Johnson’s infamous feud with his Fast and the Furious franchise co-star Vin Diesel. If Johnson really does show up eight hours late to set — or not at all — that could certainly fuel tension (though reports at the time also cited Diesel’s lateness). The article also surfaces drama with Reynolds noting that the co-stars “didn’t speak for years” after their fall 2020 blowup but have since patched things up.

There’s been counterprogramming to the Wrap story. An unconfirmed report from Puck suggests that “unflattering” press about Johnson may stem from a former publicist. People magazine ran a story about Johnson’s “flourishing career” and how he’s found “success in many areas” with an unnamed source saying “People love him.” And the Rock’s own Instagram feed has been filled with sweet fan encounters and charitable endeavors.

Years of building a good reputation will ‘offset these recent damaging allegations’

It’s true — people do love Johnson who has spent years cultivating a good reputation and it should help see him through this negative patch of press.

“The best strategy for the Rock is to tackle the bad press in a setting where he can poke fun at himself and the facts of his situation” says Schiffer. “The Rock is beloved globally and has built mountains of public goodwill that can offset these recent damaging allegations.”

How does a star like Johnson who will voice the Maui character in the Moana sequel out later this year break the cycle of bad press? By “addressing the negative items with empathy and truth owning your part in it and then showing what you learned” says Schiffer.

He adds “The Rock did that well with the outcry in Hawaii and will likely do the same with the hits on being late on the set of his film.”",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cause of death for Myrtle Beach pastor's wife Mica Miller revealed,"The cause of death has been released for  amid the ongoing investigation.

It has been an interesting offseason for the Bengals... There were solid free-agency pickups and a good draft class but two trade requests since the end of last season.

One of those trade requests came from Tee Higgins after the Bengals placed the franchise tag on him.

There has been little to no progress since the trade request according to reports but Zac Taylor has made it clear he looks forward to seeing Higgins for the 2024 season.

Cincinnati Bengals legend Chad Ochocinco hit on the topic recently and says he has been in contact with Higgins “a few times.”

“I think we’re going to work it out. We’ll figure it out” Ochocinco said when asked about the contract issues between the two sides according to TMZ Sports.

Higgins is set to make over $20 million this season with the franchise tag but it is clear he wants long-term security as well.

Ochocinco ended his conversation with TMZ saying “It’s business — it’s the nature of the business. He’s going to be all right though.”

We will see what the long-term future holds for Higgins and the Bengals but as of right now I expect to see him suited up in week one and ready to roll."

The Ministry of Defence will take control of the operation within weeks after the Prime Minister signed off a dramatic change in tactics.

Royal Navy vessels and RAF support are expected to be deployed on patrol in UK territorial waters as part of a policy blitz dubbed Operation Red Meat that Mr Johnson hopes will turn the tide of Tory disquiet at his premiership.

For the first time the UK Border Force will be placed under a military chain of command in the fight against people traffickers.

Officials hope the involvement of the Armed Forces will have a significant ‘deterrent effect’.

Government sources pledged the move would result in ‘demonstrable change’ in the Channel crisis which last year saw a record 28300 migrants reach the UK from northern France.

Operation Red Meat: Boris's attempts to take back control ‘Operation Red Meat’ is expected to include: A No 10 workplace ‘booze ban’ to end the drinking culture that led to party row. Boris Johnson is drafting rules for Downing Street staff that will limit alcohol to being served only at official functions.

Clearout of No 10 staff caught up in party row. Martin Reynolds Mr Johnson’s principal private secretary who emailed the ‘bring your own booze’ invite for the Downing Street garden party in the first lockdown and chief of staff Dan Rosenfield are among those seen at risk. Two-year BBC licence fee freeze to help ease household bills. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries is expected to confirm that the cost of an annual licence will remain at £159 until 2024.

Drive to bring down NHS waiting lists. The number of people on a hospital waiting list in England hit six million for the first time figures showed last week. In December nearly 27 per cent of patients at A&E waited more than four hours to be seen – a record high.

Extra money for jobs and skills training to help those out of work and further reduce the number of jobseekers. The unemployment rate fell to 4.2 per cent in the three months to the end of October down from 4.3 per cent in the three months to the end of September.

As announced last night the military will be drafted in to tackle illegal immigration in the Channel. Defence chiefs will take charge of efforts to stop the dangerous crossings that have reached record levels this year. Royal Navy boats could be sent to reinforce Border Force’s fleet. Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/mx/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - ->

Tory MPs welcomed the move last night. It was the first major announcement as Mr Johnson seeks to get his premiership back on track in the wake of the ‘Partygate’ scandals that have rocked his government.

‘The command of Border Force which oversees incidents in the Channel will move over to the Ministry of Defence’ a Whitehall source said.

‘This will take place by the end of the month or early February. Within a couple of weeks there will be a demonstrable change in how the Channel operation takes place. It makes a lot of sense.’

Home Secretary Priti Patel first requested military involvement in summer 2020 when the numbers crossing from France stood at just a few thousand a year.

Last night a Home Office source said: ‘We’ve been pushing for it for so long but there has been massive reluctance to act in other parts of government.

'Priti has been asking for military defence of UK territorial waters since August 2020 and after months and months of wrangling in Whitehall the PM has agreed with her that we need a change in operational posture.’

Asked whether it could mean military assets deployed in the Channel a Whitehall source said: ‘That is ultimately a question for the military but yes it probably does and it will certainly mean many more military personnel becoming involved.’

November saw 27 migrants including women and children drown on the French side of the Channel in the worst tragedy since the start of the crisis. They were among at least 39 people to have lost their lives trying to make the crossing in 2021.

On Friday a Sudanese man in his 20s became the first migrant so far this year to lose his life attempting to reach the UK.

Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: ‘Everyone knows the Royal Navy rules the waves. This sends a clear message how serious Britain is about putting a stop to these dangerous crossings.

‘Too many lives have been lost in recent months and this crisis has gone on too long.’

The latest move indicates declining confidence in the UK Border Force within the upper echelons of the Home Office.

Earlier this month a trade union which represents 80 per cent of Border Force staff threatened strike action over Miss Patel’s proposals to turn back migrants.

The Public and Commercial Services Union described that part of the Nationality and Borders Bill currently going through Parliament as ‘morally reprehensible’.

Military involvement in the Channel will open up the prospect of so-called ‘pushback’ tactics as set out in the Bill being carried out by the Navy rather than Border Force.

‘The trade union threat to strike has certainly helped push the involvement of the military up the agenda’ one Whitehall source said.

It will also free up Border Force officials to concentrate on measures pledged under the Government’s New Plan for Immigration such as a twin-track asylum system and new processing centres.

The Home Office will also carry out a review of the ‘powers and capabilities’ of Border Force and Immigration Enforcement officers.

MoD officials are understood to want HM Coastguard to come under their remit in the Channel. The role played by the RNLI a charity is yet to be finalised.

Military deployments in the Channel are currently limited to surveillance equipment.

A nerve centre at Lydd airport in Kent 25 miles south-west of Dover controls Army ‘Watchkeeper’ drones which hunt down migrant boats with high-definition optical sensors and infrared cameras.

But hers is going to be the kind even she wouldn’t have imagined despite her ambitious character. Fresh from realising the ultimate sportsman’s wish of playing at the Olympics the South African national hockey team player is set to participate in a continental tournament a major international event as well as two World Cups in 2022.

“Of course I dreamt of all these but it is incredible that I am going to experience most of it in a single year” Johnson said during our interview in the foyer of the team’s hotel in Pretoria prior to their departure for Ghana where the national women’s hockey team will be out to continue their dominance of the continent in the Africa Cup of Nations starting on Monday. South Africa have won all seven of the previous tournaments with Johnson having made her debut in the last one played in Stellenbosch two years ago. While she and her coach emphasised that there would be no complacency it is almost a foregone conclusion that they will once again conquer Africa and thus book their ticket to the World Cup in Spain and the Netherlands in early July. As Africa’s best they should also participate at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham England from July 28 to August 8.

Prior to those two events Johnson would have already participated in another World Cup the Indoor Hockey World Cup next month in Belgium to which she will fly immediately after the Nations Cup in Ghana. That all these are happening to someone who was beginning to think representing her country was not meant for her as the call-up just didn’t happen despite her doing well at provincial level is testament to the fact that one should never give up on their goals. “I only got my first call-up to the national team in 2018 a little belatedly because I’d been playing for a while and did well playing for Western Province as a teenager and later I played for Southern Gauteng and thought I’d make the national team back then. But better late than never right?” she chuckled having arrived a little late for our interview straight from work at a school where she is a sports administrator.

That she eventually got to play for her country is because she was fortunate to have worked with a legend of the game. “I was very lucky because I played with Pietie Coetzee for Southern Gauteng and later she also coached me while I was a student at Wits. When you played with Pietie you just had to up your game because she had this way of commanding excellence from those around her. “As a coach Pietie made all of us feel very important and key to the team irrespective of our experience or talents or achievements.”

So vastly that Johnson was soon turning out for her country and last year went to the Tokyo Olympics to realise a long-held dream. “Aaah the Olympics! What can I say? It was because of the Olympics that I really took playing hockey seriously. Back in 2008 I saw the Beijing Olympics and watched a lot of hockey matches. I was already playing the game then after my cousin had given me a stick and just watching those matches I knew there and then that I’d one day love to play at the Olympics. And it has now happened even though sometimes I have to pinch myself because it is unbelievable that I am an Olympian. “I made my family proud because I am the first Olympian in the Johnson family” explained the daughter of football coach Cavin Johnson who has worked at clubs such as Supersport United Platinum Stars and Amazulu as well as having been assistant at Al Ahly and developed many stars at the School of Excellence.

Though a coach Johnson does not meddle in his daughter’s career. “My dad is supportive. He does come to watch and tell me I had not done so bad” she laughs. “But he never put me under pressure. I have very supportive parents.” Lilian du Plessis of South Africa celebrates her goal against Ghana with teammates Robyn Johnson and Onthatile Zulu. Picture: Ryan Wilkisky/BackpagePix Of course Tokyo 2020 was nothing like Beijing 2008 because there were no spectators in Japan. But for Johnson it was still a special experience.

“For me that first day when we went to the hockey arena for practice was the moment I knew I was at the Olympics. Seeing those Olympic rings the lights of the arena – being on the turf it was goose-bumps stuff. Memories from watching Beijing came back and it felt unbelievable that I was there at the Games.” She could well go to her second Olympics in Paris in two years’ time and she has set her sights on doing exactly that. First though she has to live up to coach Nkuliso “Inky” Zondi’s assertion that she is one of our matured players who will have to guide the younger ones coming into the squad.",,,,,,,,,

From opening a bank account or line of credit to exploring mortgage financing options and small business loans your new Community Manager at the Chase branch at 210 W Capitol Dr is tuned in to your community’s financial wellness needs and ready to help you achieve your next milestone.

Jerry Johnson II – one of 150 Community Managers we’re hiring across the country – joined our team specifically to work with you and your community to increase awareness of and access to resources financial health tools and services. Community Managers are often from local neighborhoods who understand the challenges your community faces and have committed to helping you forge a strong financial future at any stage of your financial journey. With the help of local nonprofit partners who are invested in driving change for Black communities in Milwaukee we are bringing more allies to your local bank branch who share Chase’s goal of empowering you to improve and achieve financial health.

We sat down with Jerry to discuss plans to help Milwaukee’s Black communities grow the changes the new branch is expected to bring and how you can work with him to chart your path forward and meet your financial goals.

How does your job differ from other Chase Bank Branch Managers?

JERRY: My role was designed specifically to meet the unique financial wellness needs of our city’s Black community. We want to evolve from community banking to community building and to do this we’re actively working to reverse systemic inequalities across the financial system break down economic barriers and support the success of our customers and our community. We plan to start by providing access to financial health resources tools and allies to help you achieve your financial goals. Think of a community manager as a neighbor who understands intentional relationship building the financial needs of leaders organizations and people in your community – and who introduces you to the right person in the bank who can help. Meanwhile a branch manager is a more traditional role created to help you with everyday banking needs – like opening a bank account or offering advice on homeownership and small business growth.

How do you hope to financially empower the Black community in Milwaukee?

JERRY: We want to be a financial source of information to provide knowledge for communities that have been historically marginalized. Our mission is to promote financial empowerment and increase the opportunities to gain access to capital for creating economic viability and increase the rate of homeownership which is a foundational cornerstone for creating generational wealth. We’re here to empower members and businesses in the Black community with tools to build generational wealth and a long-lasting legacy. Awareness and accessibility are key and we see the local branch as an ideal place to begin fostering vital community connections and touchpoints to help our customers reach their financial goals. As a Community Manager my job is to connect with the individuals families and business owners here in Milwaukee and increase awareness and utilization of available resources. My team and I will help you and others in your neighborhood take advantage of financial health tools products and services while aiming to boost general financial knowledge via unique and free interactive programs such as:

• Resources to support financial health

• Home buying tips

• Educational and enrichment workshops such as resume writing and cybersecurity tips

• Growth support for entrepreneurs starting or expanding their small businesses

While we’re just getting started I hope to make a real difference in the lives of the families individuals homeowners and business owners in our community.

What financial opportunities will you make available to Black communities here in Milwaukee?

JERRY: We want to promote financial health homeownership and Black-owned businesses.

One of our priorities will be to help individuals in our community open a checking account for the first time as this is the key to financial stability and critical to closing gaps in access to banking. To do this we’ll walk through our low-cost no-overdraft checking accounts like Chase Secure Banking which can offer security to those who might be new to banking or who have had trouble getting or keeping a bank account in the past.

My team is also responsible for promoting growth among Black-owned small businesses – which means we’ll help local entrepreneurs secure loans. We’ve also brought on board home lending advisors who are focused on helping more of the community secure the funds needed for affordable sustainable homeownership. Lastly we’re proud to team with several local nonprofit organizations that have grant dollars available to aid in the pathway to homeownership and that are helping lead this change in Milwaukee.

You mentioned another goal of the branch is “community building.” What does this mean and how will you do this in Milwaukee?

JERRY: Community building goes back to the word “trust” and we want to showcase Chase is the bank for all. The way we’re going to do that is by being present by listening to the voice of our communities understanding their needs and helping supply those needs with tools and resources that the branch has to offer. “Each one reach one. Each one teach one. Until all are taught” is the philosophy I have for this branch. I want this branch to be a place where we can learn and grow together so we can all benefit together. A big priority for us is also working with local nonprofits and organizations who understand and are invested in driving change.

Our staff will play a vital part in this as well – not just from Milwaukee but from a reflection of the local Black communities we call home. I was born and raised in this great city of Milwaukee. I have a deep love and commitment to this city. For me serving people in this community is a personal as well as professional passion.

Stop by to learn more about the resources available. My team and I look forward to getting to know you.

The S&P 500's 2022 struggles continued as bank stocks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season by reporting mixed numbers.

On Tuesday Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee as part of his reconfirmation process. Powell said persistently elevated inflation is a signal the U.S. economy ""no longer needs or wants"" highly accommodative monetary policy measures but added that the ""era of very low interest rates"" is likely here to stay.

Following Powell's testimony the U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday that the consumer price index increased by 7% in December the highest inflation recorded since 1982. The CPI reading was up 0.5% compared with November and in line with economist estimates.

On Monday video game developer Take-Two Interactive announced a $12.7 billion buyout of Zynga maker of popular social media game ""FarmVille."" The $9.86-per-share buyout price represented a 64% premium to Zynga's previous week's closing share price.

Chester Paper Plant Managers Give Official TP Ruling,"You hang toilet paper rolls over not under. “That is the official Scott Paper answer” says Robert Barkhau senior engineering manager at Chester’s Kimberly-Clark Paper Mill where 60 percent of the national supply of Scott 1000 toilet paper is created.

A recent visit to the plant gave a behind-the-scenes look at toilet paper operations reports Amanda Brady for 6 ABC.

Toilet paper rolls came from the minds of Philadelphia brothers E. Irvin and Clarence Scott in 1890.

Before that toilet paper was sold mostly in drug stores as a pack of stacked sheets.

As indoor plumbing became more prevalent and the public started focusing on personal hygiene the idea of a toilet paper roll was embraced.

By 1915 the Scott brothers were putting 1000 sheets on a roll. Paper product production really took off when they moved from Philadelphia to Chester.

Today the Chester plant produces about two million rolls daily.

Barkhau and Kevin Bigelow senior manager of product systems said people never gave much thought about toilet paper until the pandemic when suddenly It wasn’t’ there.

“We always thought it was the most important thing and we’re just glad that everyone agrees with us now” says Bigelow.

(""Stub"") Hanson on February 16 1957 in Neenah and enjoyed 52 years of marriage until his death in July of 2009.

Darlene enjoyed the many years she and Roy spent with their family and friends at their cottage on Big Lake in Gresham Wisconsin; wintering in Mesa Arizona for a number of years; traveling; trips to the casino; and watching football especially the Packers. Her greatest joy came from spending time with her grandchildren and great grandchildren.

Darlene's working career included time spent at Kimberly-Clark Valley Maintenance Service and Norman Brothers in Neenah and as the deputy registrar in the health department for the City of Fond du Lac. She retired in 1991.

Darlene is survived by her children: Corky (Brian) Bartelt Fond du Lac; Tim (Judy) Hanson Fond du Lac; Barb (Dan) Jensen Menasha; and Missy (Jim) Grones Appleton. She is further survived by eight grandchildren and their families: Jenny (Cedric) McFadden (Callie); Shawn (Lindsay) Bartelt (Elin and Lucie); A.J. (Abby) Hanson (Teagan and Fiona); Parker (Jackie) Hanson (Peyton); Taylor and Ryan (Meghan Demianiuk) Jensen; Justin (Ashley) Grones (Sadie and Ian); and Lindsey (Cody) Artymiuk (baby due in March); her sister Marcie (Paul) DeBruin; her sister-in-law Audre Hanson; and many nieces nephews and friends.

Whether it’s an athletic mask for errand running or a comfortable cloth mask for travel face masks are here to stay. And thanks to the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus we are again seeing surging sales of N95 face masks.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention legitimate N95 and KN95 masks still remain excellent barriers against this airborne virus and we’ve already shared the best places to buy N95 masks online with SPY readers.

Unfortunately — but not unexpectedly — increased demand for PPE has also led to a rise in counterfeit N95 masks that aren’t as protective as the real thing. A real N95 mask is designed to filter out 95% of airborne particles 0.3 microns in size and regular masks can’t do that. Cloth face masks may still be effective at limiting your droplets from spreading to others but they won’t protect you as well as N95 masks do. (Learn about the difference between KN95 and N95 masks.)

So how can you be sure that you’re buying genuine N95 and KN95 face respirators? We’ve put together a guide to spotting and avoiding fake and counterfeit N95 masks. We consulted experts in the healthcare field as well as manufacturers on what differentiates a real N95 mask from a fake one. If you’re ordering N95 masks online we recommend avoiding certain red flags below and purchasing from the trusted brands we’ve featured below.

How to Spot Fake N95 Masks

Fake or counterfeit N95 face masks are products falsely marketed as NIOSH-approved the certification required for legitimate N95 respirators that can be used as protective personal equipment (or PPE). NIOSH stands for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and it’s the U.S. government agency that certifies N95 masks as safe to use. KN95 masks and KN94 masks are certified by foreign governments but they should offer the exact same level of protection.

According to the CDC NIOSH-approved respirators have a few things in common. They all have a similar approval label on the respirator (or in the packaging). Usually they have a label on the actual mask itself.

Kelly Carothers Director of Government Affairs at Project N95 told SPY that if consumers “want something that is very very protective they should go with a NIOSH-approved product that says NIOSH on there. The CDC has a great link on their website that shows you what to look for.”

“Specifically it needs to say NIOSH on the mask and it needs to have something called a TC number. And the manufacturer name has to be on there. If it does not have all of those pieces of information it could potentially be counterfeit” said Carothers. (Emphasis added.)

You can also find an updated list of verified fake and counterfeit PPE on the CDC website.

NIOSH approved N95 masks



Buy: Makrite 9500-N95 Masks $29.99 (orig. $79.99) 63% OFF

NIOSH-approved respirators will all have one of the following designations: N95 N99 N100 R95 R99 R100 P95 P99 and P100. You can verify the approval number of any certified N95 masks on the NIOSH-Certified Equipment List (CEL) or the NIOSH Trusted-Source page both of which are available via the CDC website.

NIOSH-approved TC number

According to many of the experts we spoke to a respirator may be counterfeit if you spot any of these red flags:

There are no labels on the product packaging or mask itself

There’s no approval number on the respirator headband or box

There are no NIOSH-related markings on the box

NIOSH is misspelled

There are decorative elements on the mask or extra fabric; certified PPE doesn’t have these details

The products are labeled or marketed as N95 masks for kids as the NIOSH does not approve respirators for children

If the respirator has ear loops instead of headbands which provide a tighter fit it’s most likely not actually NIOSH-approved

Counterfeit N95 Masks Are Becoming More Convincing

Shahzil Amin Co-Founder and CEO at WellBefore a PPE supplier emphasizes the importance of buying from trusted websites with plenty of reviews since counterfeit N95 masks have gotten more and more sophisticated throughout the pandemic.

“Unless you live and breathe masks like we do you won’t be able to tell. These days it’s more about where you order from than trying to figure out how to spot a fake mask. Order from well reviewed and respected websites that have plenty of customer feedback and you’ll be fine” said Amin.

“Most of the mistakes are made on the packaging and on top of the masks. Look for grammar issues or NIOSH (if using N95s) logos in random places. Look up images of the real product and packaging then compare to what you have in your hands.”

He also added that many “counterfeit KN95 and N95 masks have gotten to the point where they are passing all filtration tests and are fairly good at protecting you.”

Remember: with NIOSH-approved N95 masks you can depend on at least 95% particle filtration. With those very convincing counterfeit masks? There’s no such guarantee.

Counterfeit N95 Masks KN95 Masks and Amazon

As demand for PPE rises so too does the supply of counterfeit N95 masks sold online by large retailers like Amazon. There are now hundreds of listings for N95 KN95 and other protective equipment on Amazon with many consumers paying top dollar for masks they think are protective. But are these brands actually NIOSH-approved?

Elizabeth Warren Democratic Senator from Massachusetts was quoted recently in The New York Times expressing concern about the wide availability of counterfeit masks.

“Amazon needs to do more to prevent consumers from receiving counterfeits and fakes and the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission must act if these failures continue” Warren said in a statement to the Times.

Carothers also referenced Amazon when talking about problematic counterfeit masks available for purchase online. Consumers should use caution to ensure the mask in their search results will in fact provide the level of protection they need.

“Sometimes when people go in and type in ‘N95 face masks’ the first two or three search results that they see will be sponsored KN95s. A KN95 has no federal oversight. There isn’t the FDA the CDC there’s nobody doing quality control over those masks.”

An Amazon spokesperson familiar with their QA process told SPY that the company has developed an internal review process to avoid listing counterfeit KN95 face masks.

“We remain committed to serving our customers through the pandemic in part by providing the personal protective equipment they need” they said. “For face masks marketed as N95 and KN95 we have implemented a rigorous seller vetting and product review process to ensure compliance with applicable laws regulations and Amazon policies.”

Our source added “Before listing N95 and KN95 masks in our store we verify that they are sourced from a trusted manufacturer by inspecting supplier invoices to trace inventory reviewing packaging and product descriptions and comparing against the CDC’s counterfeit mask list.”

We understand that a lot of people prefer to buy face masks on Amazon and we get it. Not many retailers can compete with Amazon’s range of options and fast free shipping.

We recommend sticking with one of Amazon’s house brands such as HUHETA which provides affordable and protective KN95 masks.

N95 Masks Vs. Other Types of Masks

As we mentioned in the intro an N95 mask is designed to filter out at least 95% of non-oil airborne particles including airborne viruses like the one that causes COVID-19. The approval process for real N95 masks is also far more rigorous than for KN95 or other types of masks if they even have an approval process at all.

The N95 designation is regulated by NIOSH and obtaining that seal of approval takes months and lots of financial investment.

Carothers helped shed light on the ongoing certification that is “N95.”

“It is a six to nine month process at a minimum. It costs somewhere close to six figures it’s very expensive and [the manufacturers] are subject to ongoing audits. NIOSH will come and audit your quality system every year and that is the big difference between NIOSH and a KN95 or a mask that doesn’t have oversight.”

What To Do If You’ve Purchased Counterfeit N95 Masks

We also consulted experts on what consumers should do if they’ve purchased N95 masks they now suspect are counterfeit.

Carothers said “it depends on everyone’s personal level of risk. For someone who has diabetes or is immunocompromised I would recommend they throw that mask out and buy a NIOSH-approved product. If it was my mother or grandmother I would make sure they have NIOSH-approved masks.”

She clarified that “most healthy young people are okay with a good quality mask. But otherwise I wouldn’t take the chance. If you’re going on an airplane if you’re traveling and you’re going to be in a very crowded indoor setting I wouldn’t wear those masks – I would make sure you have a NIOSH-approved product.”

Below we’ve collected examples of real verified NIOSH-approved N95 masks as well as genuine KN95 masks. All of these products are for sale online from trustworthy brands. When shopping in-person be sure to use the advice above so you can always decipher between real N95 face masks and counterfeit ones.

But in recent years the center’s owners Kimco Realty have made several additions including constructing a two-story building and a parking garage on Coulter Avenue. They’ve also completed renovations to the upper and lower courtyards.

Now the next construction phase is about to begin.

The latest expansion plans went before the Lower Merion Building and Planning Committee which recommended approval of the plan. The recommendation paves the way for the commissioners to approve the project at the next board meeting.

Like some of the other recent projects the latest proposed expansion is also on Coulter Avenue. One section of the redevelopment zone was an Urban Outfitters store. Kimco purchased the other five adjoining properties along Coulter Avenue.

The six properties sit on a 1.69-acre site that would be combined for the construction of a new mixed-use building. The new building would have a 57256 square foot footprint with 19667 square feet of ground-floor retail space and 131 apartments.

The 213 parking spaces would be a mixture of an underground lot and a surface lot behind the building. Access to the lot would come from Coulter Avenue.

Mike Ogden with Kimco Realty Corporation said there are about 56 spaces above grade and 157 below grade.

An underground stormwater management system and a green roof will also be part of the project.

“The entire garage will be EV ready” Ogden said. “Again it’s where we’re headed so we’ll be prepared for it. As more and more cars go to electric so that we can continue to switch over.”

According to Ogden as the need for the charging stations grow it will just be a matter of adding the additional hardware.

The project has undergone some modifications since the tentative sketch plan was approved in the summer of 2019. Twenty-one residential units were removed and 275 square feet of retail spaces was added. There was also a reduction in 15 parking spaces and the removal of a second level of underground parking on the site.

Following its meeting with the Lower Merion Planning Commission in October an area designated for bike parking and storage was added to the plans. Two parking spaces were removed to improve maneuverability.

Another change made by Commissioner Scott Zelov took place this week when he asked for an amendment to the approval to increase the width of an internal passageway to at least 10 feet.

Although the plan wouldn’t be compliant with today’s zoning code it was submitted under the township’s older zoning code and the Mixed-Use Special Transit District.

Commissioner Mike McKeon was one of three commissioners voting against the project.

“This is a project that would not be compliant under our current code” said McKeon. “In a lot of ways this is a ghost of MUST and our old zoning code – or I guess I could call it a poltergeist. But it’s not a good project for existing residents – it’s inappropriate it’s too big it’s too dense five stories 131 units but it is compliant and I intend to oppose it mainly as a protest vote.”

In the end the plan passed with three commissioners voting against it.",,,,,,,,,,,,

And Europe led the way globally with the biggest uptick in listing activity.

There were of course some highs and some lows.

Romanian robotic automation giant UiPath shone on its Nasdaq debut in April becoming one of European’s most valuable startups at a $35.8bn valuation. By contrast Deliveroo’s London debut in March saw the food delivery giant lose more than a quarter of its value on its first day of trading leading one of its bankers to name it “the worst IPO in London’s history”.

Who are the European startups that might be ready to go public in the year to come?

While some of these companies have openly expressed their intent to list other predictions are speculative. Our methodology is noted at the end. Think we should add someone on there? Let us know in the comments below.

Sebastian Siemiatkowski CEO of Klarna

Klarna

Founded: 2005

Sector: Fintech (payments)

HQ: Stockholm

Revenue: £1bn (2020); 31% growth on 2019

IPO hints: One of the most talked-about IPO prospects right now is Klarna Europe’s most valuable startup at $46bn. The Swedish buy now pay later firm had a busy 2021 — peppered with seven acquisitions including Hero and Pricerunner. With the latter its chief product officer pitched the company as “a viable and competitive alternative for retail partners vs Amazon Google and Facebook”.

As we went into last year CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told the FT an IPO should happen in the next “one or two years” and in March he appointed former HSBC executive Niclas Neglén as CFO likely to kickstart the IPO process.

A potential autumn IPO for Klarna after an expected handful more acquisitions and perhaps another raise featured among Sifted’s startup predictions for 2022. Klarna declined to comment.

Who stands to get rich? Although Klarna doesn’t publicly disclose its cap tables Sifted has previously reported on its early investors — including Sequoia AB Oresund and Atomico — who can expect to cash out from an IPO. Most recently SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 Adit Ventures Honeycomb Asset Management Permira and Northzone have backed Klarna according to the company.

WeTransfer

Founded: 2009

Sector: Cloud-based technology

HQ: Amsterdam

Revenue: £84m+ expected in 2021 31% compound annual growth rate from 2018

IPO hints: Two weeks into the new year the owner of WeTransfer announced that the cloud-based file transfer service is seeking an IPO on its home country’s Euronext stock exchange — date TBC.

WeTransfer which has 87m monthly users across 190 countries seems confident it has healthy enough financials for the public market. The company said it recorded an adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation) of £18m on revenue of £60m for the first nine months of fiscal 2021 and CEO Gordon Willoughby this week said: “We’ve delivered a revenue CAGR [compound annual growth rate] of 31% from 2018 to 2020 and expect revenue for 2021 to exceed €100m.”

The company said its IPO will include both a primary sale of €160m in new shares and a secondary offering of existing shares by current owners and managers.

Who stands to get rich? Known backers Highland Europe Technology and HPE Institutional Fund II are both set to benefit when they sell their existing shares the company said this week.

Robert Vis Messagebird's founder and CEO

MessageBird

Founded: 2011

Sector: Telecommunications

HQ: Amsterdam

Revenue: $300m+ in 2020 est. 50% year-on-year growth



IPO hints: Back in 2020 founder and CEO Robert Vis said that MessageBird’s CFO had the directive to IPO in 12 months — which didn’t happen. He then claimed in March last year that the firm would be “ready in H1 this year” — which again didn’t happen.

Instead MessageBird raised $1bn in its Series C funding round a month later sending the company’s valuation to $3.8bn. This was accompanied by a triple whammy acquisition spree of SparkPost 24sessions and Hull bringing the total number of companies it’s nabbed to eight and making it one of Europe’s most acquisitive private companies.

Vis said sales passed $300m in 2020 implying year-on-year growth of nearly 50%. According to Dutch public filings MessageBird made a loss of $10.6m in 2019 and Vis said the company made a small loss in 2020.

Who stands to get rich? Accel Atomico Tiger Global Y Combinator and Spark Capital were some of the company’s backers at its last raise and could be in for cash if Vis finally goes ahead with the listing.

Checkout.com

Founded: 2012

Sector: Fintech (payments)

HQ: London

Revenue: 2020 European revenues stood at $253m — 73% up on 2019. Read Sifted’s latest back-of-the-envelope estimates here.

IPO hints: Checkout.com’s European profit in 2020 was $86m — making it one of the few European fintechs in the black. A healthy place to be for an IPO but founder Guillaume Pousaz has had his eyes on more cash rather than an exit. Checkout.com started the year by announcing it raised another $1bn in funds making it Europe’s second most valuable startup at $40bn just behind Klarna.

And it’s a tactic that seems to suit for the time being. Blossom Capital's Ophelia Brown who's invested in every one of Checkout.com's rounds since Series A told Sifted: “The striking thing with Checkout is that every round proved that the market opportunity just gets bigger and bigger. They started processing payments for merchants globally then fintechs then crypto exchanges then marketplace model.”

Pousaz has previously said that the US is Checkout.com’s most likely IPO destination but recently told the FT: “We know that we’re going to have a long life in the public markets but there is no rush to go.”



Who stands to get rich? Sifted recently reported that despite its London HQ Checkout.com only has two European investors on its cap table: Blossom Capital and the University of Oxford’s Endowment Fund. It’s otherwise dominated by US names including Tiger Global and Insight Partners.



Cabify

Founded: 2011

Sector: Mobility

HQ: Spain

Revenue: $516m (2021 expected)

IPO hints: One half of Spain’s two-strong unicorn stable the ridesharing company gave its strongest hint it could be moving towards an IPO when it appointed a new CFO in April last year. Antonio España already has one IPO under his belt: he steered security company Prosegur to listing one of its units in 2017.

Meanwhile Cabify said in a statement last month that it expected to reach profitability by the end of the year. The company hasn’t raised since 2019 which means it will likely be looking for fresh funding soon and could tap public markets.

But a company source told Sifted it was only “one option of many” that was being considered. “It is not the only way to achieve our goals” they said.

Who stands to get rich? Japanese commerce and retail giant Rakuten owns 40% of the company’s shares.

BlaBlaCar

Founded: 2006

Sector: Mobility

HQ: Paris

Revenue: After reporting a 71% increase in revenues in 2019 growth dipped by 30% in 2020.



IPO hints: BlaBlaCar raised $115m in its latest round in April last year bringing its valuation to $2bn. At the time the carpooling and transportation marketplace told Sifted that the next step could likely be a public listing.

“In the second half of 2022 we’ll be profitable and the logical next step of a company like BlaBlaCar would be to IPO” CEO and founder Nicolas Brusson said.

“The new fundraising is fundamentally structured as a ‘pre-IPO convertible’ that would convert into either an IPO or a large private placement but the latter is less likely given the amount of large cash we have now” he added.

Who stands to get rich? Investors including VNV Global Otiva J/F AB fund and FMZ Ventures took part in the company’s latest round and early backers including Index Ventures could also be up for a payday in the event of an IPO.

Anne Boden founder of Starling Bank

Starling Bank

Founded: 2014

Sector: Fintech (neobank)

HQ: London

Revenue: Grew 600% to £97.6m in the 16 months to March 2021 up from £14m in its 2019 results.



IPO hints: Starling became the first challenger bank to turn a profit back in October 2020 and in its latest annual report in July the company said it expects to post a fully profitable 12-month period in March 2022.

Its current projected annualised revenue for 2021 is £170m. That could mean 2020 was its last set of loss-making financial results for the foreseeable future.

Founder and CEO Anne Boden said at the time that she could float the bank by the end of 2022 or in early 2023 but was not going to rush into a flotation.

“We’re going to do it in our time” Boden said. “We’re not going to be forced to do it because it’s fashionable at the moment.

“We want the right number when we float and we’re on very solid footing.""

Who stands to get rich? The UK’s Jupiter Asset Management has backed Starling since its Series C and Goldman Sachs Fidelity Qatar Investment Authority and Millennium Management were among the investors in its latest raise last year.

Britishvolt

Founded: 2019

Sector: Battery technology

HQ: Blyth Northumberland

Revenue: Not disclosed

IPO hints: Britishvolt is creating the UK’s first gigafactory to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage and has raised £92m to date. It’s also the eighth-fastest company to reach the unicorn milestone in Europe according to Handelsblatt.

A spokesman said the company is currently “aiming to list” and “analysing all options” with London as the preferred listing location.



“The rationale for listing is to be transparent and adhere to the strict ESG standards we have baked in from the start” they added.

Who stands to get rich? Britishvolt’s investors so far include Cathexis Carbon Transition ASA NG Bailey Raghunath Subramanian and Glencore.

Zopa

Founded: 2005

Sector: Fintech (neobank)

HQ: London

Revenue: n/a

IPO hints: Zopa raised $300m in a funding round in October last year as CEO Jaidev Janardana steers the company away from pure peer-to-peer lending to providing increased banking services.

He’s also made very clear his intentions to list telling Sifted: “The company will be ready for an IPO as early as Q4 2022 by which time we would have shown a consistent track record of profitability. The size of our recent fundraise means we can be more flexible in our timing for an IPO.”

Janardana hinted that London is the preferred listing location as local investors “play to Zopa’s strengths”.

Who stands to get rich? Zopa’s latest funding round was led by Japan’s SoftBank through its Vision Fund 2. Augmentum Northzone Chimera and SilverStripe are also among its latest backers.

Onfido

Founded: 2010

Sector: Saas

HQ: London

Revenue: Undisclosed but an Onfido spokesperson confirmed its revenues increased 93% in the first 10 months of 2021 and the company has seen 100% growth in annually recurring revenue (ARR).

IPO hints: Onfido did not provide a specific comment on IPO plans but last year the digital identity startup was reported to be considering a stateside IPO due to rapid business growth in North America. It’s certainly been prepping the company for such a move — and has begun swapping British accounting standards for American.

A new US bias in the startup’s leadership team began to emerge when its cofounder Husayn Kassai stepped down in November 2020 and was replaced as CEO by US tech businessman Mike Tuchen.

Then in October last year the company announced the “strategic hire” of US-based Faisal Chughtai as CFO formerly CFO of Inxeption and an executive director at JPMorgan Chase.

Who stands to get rich? Talis Capital M12 Augmentum Salesforce Ventures and TPG Growth were all among the investors at Onfido’s last fundraising round.

Is 2022 the year to IPO?

Dry powder accumulated by investors during the pandemic saw the amount of capital pumped into $250m+ rounds in Europe grow by about 900% in the first nine months of 2021 to $40.1bn according to Atomico’s State of European Tech report.

And payments company Checkout.com has already carried this trend into 2022 having recently announced it's raised a $1bn round bringing its valuation to $40bn.

“There’s still a tonne of dry powder hanging around that represents a huge opportunity for private companies to tap into before trying an IPO with its much more demanding constraints” says Elina Berrebi founding partner at Revaia (formerly Gaia Capital).

For this reason Berrebi believes 2022 won’t be the year we see a lot of startups choose the path to IPO.



“And for all of those that raised a lot of cash in 2021 they will have more cash than ever and the time to spend it wisely create value from it and for most companies grow into their valuation” she says.

Nonetheless provided a startup is ready the prospect of an IPO hasn’t completely lost its appeal.

“It's a massive branding event. People underestimate the recognition it gets you with customers because of the governance that comes with it” says Haakon Overli cofounder and general partner at Dawn Capital.

“You can raise money quickly — and you’ve ‘grown up’ in becoming a public company.”

Methodology

Sifted relied on interviews with companies VCs and press cuttings to craft our shortlist of likely IPOs as well as using the following benchmarks:

Over $50m in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and growing at an annual rate of 30-50%

Large scale and expensive operations (often having attained unicorn status in 2018 or before)

Making changes around CEO chairman and CFO (ideally ones with exit experience)

Raised £100m+ across a maximum of five fundraising rounds

Clear path to profitability

We also limited it to companies listing on main exchanges rather than alternative markets where smaller startups can sell their stock.

Even his greatest critics would have to take a bitter bite of humble pie and admit that in that time few players made kicking leather with the left as beautiful a sight as that slight wizard from Gelvandale PE.

It is a left foot that mesmerised defenders and befuddled goalkeepers a left foot that enthralled and terrified spectators in equal measure depending on which side one rooted for.

From Supersport United and Orlando Pirates to Bidvest Wits and Chippa when Klate’s foot caressed the football one could logically conclude that more often than not one of two outcomes was possible: the ball could either find the head of an attacker or in a more direct fashion the back of the net.

As good and sweet as that left foot was it is hard to imagine that it almost did not make it onto the football field.

When he was only five years old Klate was hit by a car breaking that precocious leg. Growing up in the rough streets of Gelvandale Klate lived a stone’s throw away from a shebeen.

Daine in his younger days

One day one drunken driver got behind the wheel and with over a ton of metal in his intoxicated hands hit a young Klate breaking his tiny leg.

It was a miracle that he could still use it afterwards let alone play the game up to such a high level with it.

Three years after that car almost stopped history on that remote corner in Gelvandale Klate began taking the first tentative steps on a record-breaking journey in the South African game. Like all journeys it started with a few baby steps. It would all end in diski immortality for the leftie from Gelvandale.

“Playing football started down in PE at school. At the age of 8 I started playing structured football for club Glenville Celtic and by the time I was 14 I moved to the Transnet School of Excellence” Klate remembers.

Cavin Johnson recalls how even at that tender age Klate and his precocious left foot already stood out from the rest something that led to his selection ahead of 100 other boys in a gruelling trial in September 1999.

“We identified him when he was very young in PE for the Transnet School of Excellence” Johnson tells FARPost.

Cavin was part of the scouting team that identified Daine during a trial in Gqeberha in 1999

School of Excellence: More Than Just Coaching

Over the years a lot has been said and written about the contribution of the School of Excellence to the success of South African football. Credit has been given to the coaching staff in large parts and rightfully so. After all these were the guardians who became the architects of one of South African football’s most celebrated talent nurseries. However little has been said of the young boys like Klate who left home barely into their adolescence who left their comfort zones as they were beginning to discover who they indeed are and made a new life away from the support and protection offered by parents and guardians.

“He has to be given credit for coming from PE to spend most of his life in Johannesburg go to school not to have his parents around it is difficult” adds Johnson

Klate has not forgotten how hard those first months at the School of Excellence were. He remembers how in those days when he was far removed from the loving embrace and protective umbrella of family he found himself wondering if maybe he should go back home. In the bright lights of Gauteng the familiarity and warmth of his native Gelvandale looked tantalising.

“The first couple of months were tough but with the support of my family and friends encouraging me I stuck out the year” Klate tells FARPost.

Daine admits the first couple of months at the School of Excellence were challenging

Klate’s Tough Choice at Youth Academy

According to his younger brother Chad Klate football was not his only love when growing up in PE. So good was he in the game of cricket that in the end he had to decide between the two sports on the cusp of his move to the School of Excellence.

Daine Klate and former Bafana Bafana player Elrio Van Heerden used to interchange football and cricket comfortably during their childhood days.

“Daine Klate is still an avid cricket player; even now he plays cricket in PE with underprivileged guys at the Gelvandale Cricket Club” Chad tells FARPost.

His friends including Wayne Parnell and Ashwell Prince made it professionally.

“He played provincial cricket and soccer and the School of Excellence opportunity had to move him to soccer because they only offered soccer. He couldn’t play cricket anymore after choosing the School of Excellence” adds Chad a former football journalist.

“Matatazela”: The All-rounder With Natural Batting Talent

Exceptional bowling incredible wicket keeping and an incessant desire to score runs. The man nicknamed ‘Matatazela’ was such an all-rounder. “He’s a great bowler but I think he is at his happiest batting. His strokes the way he hits the ball the technical ability – it’s just natural. He stopped playing when he was 13 so he didn’t receive much coaching. So everything he has now is just natural” explains Chad.

Sam Mbatha was part of the coaching team at the School of Excellence

Like most footballers that are cream of the game Klate’s professionalism is not something that only visited him and decided to stay while he was at the School of Excellence. The leftie remembers how he and his one-time cricketing buddy Van Heerden were putting in the hard yards while other youngsters were resting on their laurels. That drive and determination would stay with him throughout his career.

“The other boys in PE used to train once a week; Elrio van Heerden and I used to train five times a week. By the time the weekend matches came we had five sessions under us while others had one” Klate says.

However it was at the School of Excellence where Klate developed some of the finer aspects of the game. Mzansi Coaching Legends Shaped Klate’s Number 10 Play. Although he possessed a naturally gifted left foot a switch to the wing wouldn’t happen until later in his career.

“We used to play a 4-3-3 formation at the School of Excellence and I was one of the two number 10s behind the striker. The switch happened because I could cross the ball and I was technically good” he explains.

SuperSport development coach Kwanele Kopo tells the tale of how he went on the hunt for the then teenager’s signature tracking him from his time at the School of Excellence to PE after his stint at the famed academy had come to an end.

“When I saw him at the School the qualities that stood out were his speed his excellent crossing technique and accuracy his ability to beat defenders in one-on-one situations and his ability to score from direct free-kicks” Kopo tells FARPost.

Kopo says he was impressed by Daine’s ability to take on defenders

Despite a classic left foot that seemed to weave spells around the ball what also stood for Kopo was Daine Klate’s brainpower. Unlike many other prodigies he was a thinking footballer. Armed with such a keen football brain and a terrific ability on the ball he had all the ingredients to make it at the highest level. He would soon become the first of the many fine products Kopo would deliver from the academy straight to the top flight

“We played a friendly with our first team a few months after he had joined us and he scored directly from a free-kick. The late Thomas Madigage [who was SuperSport’s Assistant Coach] came to ask me who this boy was. Madigage then told me to bring him to the senior team’s training the following week. It was such a satisfying moment as I had spent a lot of time and effort for months to profile him and recruit him to the club” adds Kopo.

Prolific Career and Trophy Haul for Klate After Academy Graduation

After graduating from the Tshwane side’s academy Klate had one of the most decorated careers in South African football history. His trophy cabinet bulges with silverware having amassed an astounding 15 trophies in as many years. These include a hattrick of titles with Matsatsantsa and another triumph with Bidvest Wits later.

Having won the league title with three different clubs all under different circumstances all those triumphs are memorable to Klate for various reasons.

“The sweetest for me was my third league title with SuperSport when I was the Player of the Season that year. I think I had a fantastic season played my best football I was the top scorer for SuperSport” says Daine Klate who went on to win the treble with Bucs.

Daine Klate had one of the most decorated careers in South African football history.

Despite his many successes at the top level of the game the failure to garner more Bafana caps has always been a cloud hanging stubbornly above an otherwise bright career.

However two years after retirement South Africa’s most capped youth international has no regrets about his career despite a paltry 13 caps for Bafana. These days his attention is once again focused on ploughing back to the game that gave him so much as he continues to earn his coaching badges.

Coaching Aspirations and Youth Focus:

“I’m on part two of my A license and then I will complete my pro license when they allow us to. I am into youth football coaching in the MDC [Chippa United] but my passion is for youth” says the 36-year-old.

Besides the friends he had to turn his back on when the beautiful game was calling Klate is also making time for the love he abandoned when his marriage to football took a severe and permanent turn – cricket.

“I am currently with my family here in PE my friends but for the most of the day I am on the soccer field coaching but I am an easy-going guy and you will find me in the hood I grew up chilling with the guys I grew up with so I live that way or you will find me by the beach playing cricket” he says.

As I may have mentioned here before I grow a lot of peppers and make my own hot sauce. A few weeks ago I grabbed a couple of chicken & cheese tacos at a truck stop and this was the available hot sauce; it is made by Kraft Heinz.

This stuff is pretty decent hot sauce not much in terms of real heat but it has a nice kick. So I’m looking at the ingredients list and thinking: “Shouldn’t be too hard to make my own version of this.” I needed something to do with those 5 quarts of jalapeño peppers I still have in the freezer anyway… Aside from the artificial preservatives etc it consists of only five ingredients: jalapeños tomato paste vinegar salt and onion powder. I have never made a tomato based hot sauce so I needed a recipe and I found just what I was looking for at ChiliPepperMadness. Y’all can check out the actual recipe here.

I tend to freelance a lot when I cook but I followed this recipe pretty much as it was written.

1 lb of frozen jalapeños.

The onion and garlic.

Simmering tomato sauce red wine vinegar onion and garlic...

The peppers are out of the oven.

The peppers and tomato mixture went into the blender for a bit and it was at this point that I had to go somewhat “off script”. The initial process yielded about 20 oz of a very stiff pepper/tomato paste. It tasted awesome but I was looking for pourable sauce not something that I’d have to spread with a spatula... Fortunately I keep a lot of several vinegars on hand so I thinned it out a good bit.

The final product ended up yielding about 40 oz...

The addition of the extra vinegar did impact the heat level but not terribly. The other hot sauces I’ve made start out really thin with only peppers vinegar water and salt. That mixture is then simmered down to half its original volume strained then thickened up a bit more with a pinch or two of xanthan gum. Those steps are not necessary with this recipe. I didn’t remove the skins from the jalapeños nor did I strain it.

So what’s the verdict? How does my copycat version of Salsa del Sol stack up to the original? No contest really. My version is pretty awesome! All you need to know is that my Wife was eating this stuff like salsa with tortilla chips. Yes it’s still thick enough for that… This recipe will become a staple of my hot sauce repertoire; I can see it working well with any hot pepper; I’m especially eager to try it with my most favorite pepper Prairie Spice.

**Just a note** This sauce needs to be kept in the fridge unless you process it in a water bath…

So What’s for Dinner? For us it was chicken & cheese soft tacos with my new hot sauce. On an aggravating note I forgot to buy sour cream and avocado… ;(

I like thighs; skin on and bone-in...

Some updates were ripe for the picking — like the new ""plant-based protein"" seal endorsed by Mr. Peanut's signature now displayed on its label.

It's a seemingly straightforward and obvious addition. Of course nuts are plant-based. Yet it is one of several changes Hormel has planned for the brand that its previous owners could have but didn't make.

The Austin Minn.-based food maker closed on its record $3.3 billion purchase of Planters from Kraft Heinz Co. in June and has wasted no time padding Mr. Peanut's pockets with marketing dollars.

""The company has big ambitions for the brand really focused on a growth mindset"" said Rafik Lawendy marketing director for Planters who joined Hormel as part of the acquisition. ""We're extremely excited for the resources the brand will be getting.""

Onlookers agree there's more value to be extracted from Planters. The brand had gone stale despite checking the box on several trends like protein-rich eating and increased snacking habits.

""The Planters brand had really struggled under Kraft and had lost sizable market share — we think Hormel will be successful at turning this around"" said Rebecca Scheuneman an equity analyst at Morningstar. ""Planters will be one of Hormel's largest brands so it will receive some pretty significant attention and marketing support.""

Mr. Peanut and the Nutmobile cruised Burlington Wis. in September. Hormel has “big ambitions for the brand really focused on a growth mind-set” said marketing director Rafik Lawendy.

Refreshed packaging is slowly hitting store shelves in a ""soft conversion"" — old labels are being used up so as not to generate waste said Jeff Frank Hormel's group vice president of grocery products. New flavors and products will be unveiled in the coming months. And last week Planters shot a Super Bowl ad after Mr. Peanut missed the big game last year.

Hormel's long-term challenge will be sustaining that growth for an already ubiquitous brand in crowded snack aisles — or any food segment Planters may try to reach.

""How do we operate as a snacking brand and stretch out of the nut aisle and into different formats and distribution points?"" Lawendy said. ""It's our job to innovate and tell that story to consumers and be there with the right offerings.""

First steps

Hormel's largest acquisition in its 130-year history marks another step away from being a commodity business focused largely on raw agricultural products. For years Hormel has worked to reposition itself as a branded food company. By adding some sort of value to products both profit margins and predictability tend to increase.

Company executives often bristle at being called a meatpacker. ""We see ourselves largely as a protein company"" Frank said.

The acquisition also brings greater distribution in places like convenience stores where Hormel can more easily place its other snack brands alongside Planters products Frank said.

""Snacking companies tend to be really good at salty savory or sweet snacks — we have something in every one of those spaces"" he said. ""Planters really anchors our snacking portfolio.""

Folding Planters into Hormel amid global supply chain breakdowns added a few headaches though peanut prices didn't see the sharp increases other commodities suffered over the past year.

A new Hormel office is being established in Chicago where Planters leadership will be based. Planters production facilities in California Arkansas and Virginia are now ""part of the Hormel supply chain"" Frank said with the finishing touches on the integration still underway.

The Corn Nuts brand which also came with the Planters purchase is now fully integrated and getting a lot of high-level support.

""I'm a fan of a lot of Planters products; the regular flavor of Corn Nuts is at the top of my list"" Hormel CEO Jim Snee said at a Faegre Drinker M&A Conference last fall. ""It has become a staple not only in the car but in my office as well.""

Frank said ""the team has gotten really aggressive around Corn Nuts"" with sales up 24% in the last quarter compared to the same period a year ago before the acquisition.

Next steps

Once Hormel harvests the ""low-hanging fruit"" of rebuilding the brand Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said he'll be watching how Planters competes long-term with store brands.

""How can they reinvigorate growth in that category and get consumers excited about Planters and the nut business in general?"" he said.

Lawendy said nuts should be on-trend for years to come; it's a matter of convincing consumers that Planters are the ""nuts of distinction.""

""The peanut is a beautiful superfood that has a lot going for it from a snacking and sustainability standpoint — it requires very little water"" Lawendy said. ""It's the snacking trifecta — something crave-able good not super processed.""

That ""plant-based protein"" label is increasingly important for Hormel. For a company long known for Spam chili bacon and turkey non-meat products now make up 25% of Hormel's sales.

Morningstar analyst Scheuneman said Hormel is eager to lean into the plant-based trend.

""It makes a lot of sense for them because per capita pork consumption has been declining in the United States as consumers get more health-conscious.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAxLTE2L3VuaWxldmVyLWlzLXNhaWQtdG8td2VpZ2gtcmFpc2luZy1vZmZlci1mb3ItZ2xheG8tY29uc3VtZXItdW5pdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unilever to Weigh Raising Offer for Glaxo Consumer Unit,"Why did this happen?

Grocery shopping in Dallas-Fort Worth in recent days may feel a bit like 2020 when food processors and consumer goods manufacturers couldn’t keep up with demand for pasta and toilet paper.

But this time the periodic empty shelves aren’t about the supply chain experts say.

Stores and warehouses are being hit by worker shortages said Gary Huddleston grocery industry consultant to the Texas Retailers Association.

And shoppers should expect to use self-checkout lanes as the fourth spike in this pandemic leaves waves of workers suddenly out sick.

“Either other employees work overtime or the shift goes empty” Huddleston said. That leaves groceries on trailers in stockrooms or at distribution centers he said.

“The pandemic and the shortage of workers continues to wear on everyone” said Jennifer Foley-Howard a spokeswoman for the UFCW Local 1000. The union based in Grapevine represents 8000 North Texas workers at Kroger.

“Members are dealing with omicron and a lot of anxiety” she said. “They are tired and overworked.” Local 1000 has hundreds of workers out with COVID-19 on top of unfilled jobs which brings the number of missing workers into the thousands Foley-Howard said.

The first reported case of the coronavirus omicron variant in Texas was in Houston 40 days ago. Since then the virus has spread rapidly and it hasn’t yet peaked in North Texas.

In the past two weeks Walmart has temporarily closed three stores in Dallas Fort Worth and Richardson for professional cleaning after an increase in positive COVID-19 cases.

Grocery chains including Kroger and Central Market have reinstated mandatory mask-wearing for employees and are encouraging customers to wear masks. Several area school districts — including Forney Mesquite and Mansfield — announced temporary closings this week forcing parents to stay home from work.

That also contributes to worker shortages Huddleston said. And school closings combined with more people being asked to work from home again means groceries are suddenly in higher demand.

Store employees are hustling.

At 9 a.m. on Friday employees at a Kroger on Forest Lane in Dallas were trying to get the store set for the weekend. The perimeter of the store where fresh and refrigerated cases line the walls with produce dairy and meat was fully stocked. Only a few aisles — cereal and pasta — were short of product but not empty.

Milk was in stock and on sale at Kroger at Forest and Greenville in Dallas on Friday.

Likewise a Tom Thumb on West Northwest Highway Central Market on Lovers Lane and a Walmart in North Dallas looked ready for the weekend.

Walmart employees said online orders have definitely picked up with the omicron surge. Curbside pickup slots may be hard to get from area grocers this weekend.

Stores are also depending more on self-checkout lanes.

During the pandemic most national chains made aggressive plans to install and expand self-checkout lanes. About 61% of grocers surveyed by the food industry association FMI last year said they plan to reintroduce or enhance self-service to make checkout more convenient.

Self-checkout has been around since the 1990s when the experience was pretty awful and the industry pulled back. It’s back because technology is better and consumers are using it.

According to FMI 29% of all grocery store transactions in 2020 were completed in self-checkout lanes up from 23% in 2019 and 18% in 2018. For larger chains with more than 100 stores that number was higher at 31% of transactions in 2020.

Many of those consumers are using online delivery or curbside for bigger orders anyway.

Kroger and Walmart are experimenting with all-self-checkout stores. Kroger’s is in Oak Lawn and Walmart’s is in Plano. Costco has added self-checkout lanes in its Dallas store on Coit Road.

There’s a big debate — even during labor shortages and pandemics — about self-checkout taking jobs away. But self-checkout can’t operate without a staffer standing ready to validate that shoppers are 21 when buying beer and wine and to help the technically challenged among us.

If you believe the buzz on social media platforms shoppers hate self-checkout. But they’ll have to get used to it. Worker shortages are likely to continue and the UFCW Local 1000′s Foley-Howard says grocery employees are struggling.

“While there is much beyond their (workers’) control and they continue to have their own personal challenges as result of this pandemic they show up as front-line workers — years into this pandemic — and are doing their very best” Foley-Howard said.

It had languished in various locations at the corner property for years. The proposed Fry's supermarket project is directly adjacent to the SaddleBrooke main entrance gateway on North Oracle Road in Pinal County.

According to Rob Bassett chief operating officer of the Phoenix-based Pederson Group there is no progress to report and no final decision to move forward on the unfinished SaddleBrooke Marketplace project.

""The current construction cost environment is still presenting significant challenges for this site. Both Fry's and Pederson Group are continuing to pursue this project however we cannot currently provide an update on timing.""

""We are still working through the cost to construct the project"" he added.

Business economists estimate that 2022 will be a year of a problematic dependence on contractor availability with labor supply scarcities building material pricing surges and construction material shortages. The recent COVID-19 wave also negatively impacts the developer's strategy. It may be some time before Pederson and notably the Kroger Co. owners of Fry's makes a final decision to proceed or not go forward on the grocery store plan at SaddleBrooke.

The Pederson Group has already invested significant revenue in underground utility infrastructure concrete drainage and preconstruction grading at the site.

The city is looking for ways to diversify Philadelphia Gas Works’ revenue while also reducing the utility’s emissions — and the debate over potential alternatives is extremely technical. A study published by the city last month recommended that PGW try out three pilot programs.

The Inquirer asked three locals with unique experience and views on issues of energy and climate to explain how weatherization geothermal heating and biofuels could impact Philadelphians — and contribute to the city’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Weatherization: The most cost-effective way to reduce energy consumption

Weatherization is a term used to describe the process of making a home more comfortable and energy efficient. When my company weatherizes a home our goal is to reduce the energy load by 25% — the energy that you no longer use translates to financial savings for the consumer and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. Weatherization is one of the very few things that homeowners can do to their home that returns money to them.

The challenge is that it can be expensive.

Some help does exist. The federal Weatherization Assistance Program which is the largest program in the country is funded by the Department of Energy. That program can provide weatherization to households making less than 200% of the federal poverty level (an annual income of about $53000 for a family of four). Once homeowners are eligible they don’t have to pay a cent to weatherize their home.

The real problem exists for those who live between 200% and 400% of the federal poverty level — for example a family of four making $53000 to $106000 annually — and want to make their home more energy efficient. Based on existing criteria those homeowners have to figure out how to fund weatherization themselves a process that can cost about $3000 to $5000 for an average-size home.

One possible solution: Raise the bar for eligibility to allow folks who earn up to 400% of the federal poverty level to receive free weatherization. That will expand this effort to many more households.

Steve Luxton is the executive director and CEO at the Energy Coordinating Agency of Philadelphia a nonprofit that has been weatherizing homes since 1984.

Geothermal energy: Protecting jobs and low-income residents’ utility bills

Like many cities Philadelphia faces a series of interconnected crises: poor air quality and high rates of asthma high energy bills and the disastrous effects of climate change. These problems cause the greatest harm to low-income Philadelphians and communities of color. POWER Interfaith and other organizations devoted to economic and racial justice have advocated for PGW to explore making large-scale investments in networked geothermal heating and cooling systems as a way to address these problems simultaneously.

Gas appliances produce dangerous indoor air pollution. People who have additional risk factors — often produced by racism and poverty — and who have the least access to health care experience the greatest harm from this pollution. Replacing fracked gas with gas from landfills or sewage plants as many gas utilities have suggested would not improve air quality in our homes. Geothermal technologies in contrast use electric heat pumps to heat or cool buildings. This is the cleanest way to provide heating or cooling for homes.

The move away from gas needs to be carefully planned and coordinated to protect low-income residents. Many low-income Philadelphians already experience a high energy burden which means they pay too much of their income for gas and electricity. If higher-income residents who can afford to switch to electric appliances stop buying gas from PGW that could raise prices for remaining PGW customers.

Some argue that moving away from natural gas could eliminate PGW workers’ jobs and imperil PGW retirees’ pensions. However if executed thoughtfully the creation of a system of water pipes heated by the earth’s energy can do just the opposite: maintain jobs for PGW workers and provide climate and financial incentives for all ratepayers to continue to rely on PGW for heating and cooling. While the upfront costs would be significant they can be offset by redirecting some of the money PGW now pays to maintain and rebuild the current gas infrastructure and the new geothermal infrastructure would last for decades.

Through a careful transition to geothermal energy PGW can invest for the long term on behalf of all Philadelphians. Such an investment could limit the financial burden on individuals reduce customers’ bills and limit harm to low-income residents and PGW workers.

Biofuels: Not a single solution but a step

Renewable natural gas or RNG is biogas that is made by the decomposition of organic material at landfills and other waste treatment sites. Once recovered and processed RNG can be delivered by your utility and used in place of natural gas. These uses include home heating and cooking and industrial processes like electricity generation.

RNG is mostly methane which is estimated to be as much as 80 times more potent of a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Using RNG as a fuel reduces methane leakage into the atmosphere from landfills and other waste treatment facilities. In addition RNG is obtained without drilling or fracking. Using RNG also reduces harmful disruption to air ground and water resources that occurs when fossil natural gas is recovered. Finally RNG is a readily available and sustainable alternative to finite fossil natural gas reserves.

Is there enough RNG to replace all fossil gas? No. But a 2019 study by the consulting firm ICF estimated that the potential for pipeline-quality RNG production could meet 10% to 24% of U.S. natural gas consumption needs by 2040. And an informal survey of Pennsylvania landfills by the Energy Co-op several years ago suggests that there is enough biogas available in Pennsylvania to supply RNG to all Philadelphia residential customers.

RNG will not be the sole answer to global warming and climate change. But wide-scale recovery and use of RNG would be a major step toward a carbon-neutral planet and a more sustainable energy future for all Philadelphians.

Alexandra Kroger is the energy programs director of the Energy Co-op. The Energy Co-op is the first and currently only supplier of RNG to Peco and PGW customers.",,,

The S&P 500's 2022 struggles continued as bank stocks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season by reporting mixed numbers.

On Tuesday Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee as part of his reconfirmation process. Powell said persistently elevated inflation is a signal the U.S. economy ""no longer needs or wants"" highly accommodative monetary policy measures but added that the ""era of very low interest rates"" is likely here to stay.

Following Powell's testimony the U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday that the consumer price index increased by 7% in December the highest inflation recorded since 1982. The CPI reading was up 0.5% compared with November and in line with economist estimates.

On Monday video game developer Take-Two Interactive announced a $12.7 billion buyout of Zynga maker of popular social media game ""FarmVille."" The $9.86-per-share buyout price represented a 64% premium to Zynga's previous week's closing share price.

Casino stocks Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts rallied on Friday after the Macau government released a draft of a new bill outlining the license renewal process for Macau casino operators. Macau will maintain a maximum of six total licenses suggesting it's likely the current six Macau operators will all have their licenses renewed for 10 years.

JPMorgan withdrawal

Shares of U.S. megabank JPMorgan Chase dropped more than 5% on Friday morning after the company reported a fourth quarter earnings beat but cut its 2022 financial guidance and said ""inflationary pressures"" will increase expenses by 8% this year.

Investors will get more fourth-quarter earnings numbers in the week ahead including reports from Bank of America UnitedHealth and Procter & Gamble on Wednesday and Netflix on Thursday.

S&P 500 companies are on track to report full-year 2021 earnings growth of 45.3% according to FactSet.

Economic numbers

In the week ahead investors will get key economic updates from Asia on Monday when the National Bureau of Statistics of China releases its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate and on Friday when the People's Bank of China releases its latest interest rate decision.

Un grupo de jugadores del sorteo de la Lotería de Navidad de España agrupados por un despacho de abogados de Barcelona defiende la postura de que sus números fueron beneficiados porque los “niños de San Ildefonso” los cantaron aunque resulta que lo hicieron erróneamente por lo que esos décimos no están en la lista oficial final cuenta el diario El Mundo.

El reglamento de loterías es claro: los números agraciados son aquellos que realmente aparecen en la lista oficial y no aquellos que hayan podido ser leídos erróneamente por los niños de San Ildefonso en un sorteo a toda velocidad.

También se establece la previsión de controles fehacientes con interventores y otras figuras para dar más seguridad jurídica al sorteo y transcribir escrupulosamente cada número introducido tras salir del bombo.

Es así como se constituye al final una lista oficial de premios que es pública y comprobable incluso ‘in situ’ tras el sorteo de la Lotería de Navidad.

En el sorteo del 22 de diciembre de 2021 según el grupo de afectados se leyeron mal hasta 56 números una cifra que para algunos es muy alta aunque lo cierto es que solo representa un 31% de los 1.794 premios cantados por los niños.

La abogada barcelonesa Olga Majoral cuyo despacho está centralizando las demandas de todas las personas afectadas por estos “premios fantasma” ha explicado que merecen una respuesta de Loterías y que algunos de sus clientes quieren ir “hasta el final”.

Por ahora su despacho ha presentado una reclamación administrativa a Loterías todavía sin respuesta una tardanza que la letrada justifica porque su reclamación tiene más de quince páginas y “lo lógico es que si quieren dar una respuesta rigurosa lo estudien bien”.

Si llegado el caso nadie les contestara o se les negara una respuesta satisfactoria ha explicado no cierran la puerta a acudir entonces a la vía contenciosa-administrativa.

“En ningún caso creemos que haya delito de fraude o se pueda ir a la vía penal” matizó según lo que refleja el diario español.

El reglamento de loterías es claro: los números agraciados son aquellos que realmente aparecen en los alambres y la lista oficial y no aquellos que hayan podido ser leídos erróneamente por los niños de San Ildefonso en un sorteo a toda velocidad con cerca de dos mil pedreas.

También se establece la previsión de controles fehacientes con interventores y otras figuras para dar más seguridad jurídica al sorteo y transcribir escrupulosamente cada número introducido en el alambre tras salir del bombo.

Es así como se constituye al final una lista oficial de premios que es pública y comprobable incluso 'in situ' tras el sorteo de la Lotería de Navidad.

""En ningún caso creemos que haya delito de fraude o se pueda ir a la vía penal"" ha matizado.

Para la abogada el sorteo de la Lotería Nacional ""no es ningún bingo de pueblo sino un sorteo donde se reparten muchos millones"" lo que en su opinión exige ""garantías suficientes"" que ahora no se están dando.

Majoral reconoce que no puede recaer la responsabilidad de posibles errores ""en unos niños"" pero apunta que la forma de proceder es ""arcaica"" y que existe hoy en día tecnología suficiente como para evitar estos errores que han costado un disgusto a decenas de personas.

Entre las afectadas está Txell Llorac una joven cuya alegría por escuchar su número de lotería se desvaneció cuando ni en internet ni en la administración cercana a la que fue a preguntar daban su décimo como premiado. Tenía 74 billetes y pensaba haber ganado 7.400 euros.

En su intento por conseguir que lo dieran por bueno buscó el minuto exacto en el que uno de los niños dice su número el 29281 justo cuando había transcurrido una hora y treinta y dos minutos del sorteo pero aún no ha obtenido respuesta.

Llorac como muchos otros afectados ha confiado a Majoral la defensa de su caso y ha puesto en duda el control que hacen los notarios tras el cante de los niños de San Ildefonso.

Majoral reconoce que más allá de los casos concretos buscan ""reformular un debate sobre las garantías y la opacidad del sorteo"".

Según ella debería poder consultarse el listado provisional de números que se elabora durante el sorteo y no solo el oficial revisado final.

Sobre la posibilidad de que las personas que tienen uno de esos números ""fantasma"" tengan o no opción a reclamación Adalberto Guerrero profesor colaborador de los Estudios de Derecho y Ciencia Política de la UOC ha explicado a Efe que ""estamos hablando de un error humano"" y que eso implica que en todo el sorteo haya carencias de seguridad jurídica.

""El niño se puede equivocar pero hay garantías para detectar y comprobar y existen personas allí haciendo funciones de fedatario público"" ha recordado.

Al mismo tiempo el abogado de Círculo Legal sí ha destacado que no es óbice para que los afectados puedan reclamar indemnizaciones si consideran que ha habido ""daño moral o económico"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmZvYmFlLmNvbS9zb2NpZWRhZC8yMDIyLzAxLzE3L2VuLXVuYS12aWVqYS1iaWNpY2xldGEteWEtcmVjb3JyaW8tMTAtbWlsLWtpbG9tZXRyb3MtcG9yLXB1ZWJsb3MteS1iYXJyaW9zLXBhcmEtY29udGFyLWxhcy1oaXN0b3JpYXMtcXVlLW5hZGllLXZlL9IBsgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmZvYmFlLmNvbS9zb2NpZWRhZC8yMDIyLzAxLzE3L2VuLXVuYS12aWVqYS1iaWNpY2xldGEteWEtcmVjb3JyaW8tMTAtbWlsLWtpbG9tZXRyb3MtcG9yLXB1ZWJsb3MteS1iYXJyaW9zLXBhcmEtY29udGFyLWxhcy1oaXN0b3JpYXMtcXVlLW5hZGllLXZlLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcC10eXBl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,En una vieja bicicleta ya recorrió 10 mil kilómetros por pueblos y barrios para contar las historias que nadie ve,"En-el-mítico-ex-frigorífico-Swift-en-Berisso

A fin de año con un dejo de preocupación el periodista Diego Dimitroff publicó en su Facebook: “Estoy disfrutando de un paseo en bici por el Terraplén Costero de Berisso en este atardecer nublado. Tenemos muchísima belleza y naturaleza en nuestra ciudad. Como pocos lugares. Hay que cuidar el monte. Vi muchos árboles cortados”.

Días atrás a 17 años de la tragedia de Cromañón había viajado en su bicicleta desde Berisso hasta Once y recorrió el “Pasaje de los pibes de Cromañón” posteando unas fotos y un breve relato. Y poco tiempo antes había ido hasta Magdalena donde escribió: “Entre calles de tierra pinos eucaliptos aroma de campo flores y cantos de pájaros visité la cancha del club Unión y Fuerza de Magdalena que disputa el torneo de Primera División de la Liga Chascomunense de fútbol”.

La de Diego Dimitroff es de esas historias simples mínimas sencillas que tanto han filmado Carlos Sorín David Lynch o el turco Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Aventuras nada extravagantes nada de viajar de un punto lejano nada de preparar una bicicleta todo terreno de última generación para llegar a otra provincia incluso a otro país.

Diego es periodista tiene 46 años y en un año con su bicicleta Philips modelo inglesa de 1941 recorrió 10.000 kilómetros 70 canchas de fútbol 50 estaciones de trenes y pueblos espacios históricos del conurbano bonaerense y de Capital Federal y más de 50 villas y asentamientos. Así con su impronta de amante de lo retro de rescate de los lugares olvidados que yacen a pocos metros a pocos kilómetros de distancia ha llegado a estar entre las historias más leídas del portal de Facebook “Bycicle World” que tiene 46 mil integrantes en el plano internacional.

Todo comenzó en julio del 2020 en etapa de pandemia y encierro. “Lamentablemente estaba atravesando un estado de profunda preocupación y tenía algunos problemas de salud. Los resultados clínicos que había arrojado el análisis de sangre eran testimonio de que debía tomar cartas en el asunto: tanto los índices de colesterol glucemia y triglicéridos me dieron negativos. Una enzima hepática cuyo valor más alto era 30 había arrojado 94!!!!! El plus: mi peso era de 103 kilos cuando normalmente no superaba los 89″ cuenta Dimitroff que hace poco tiempo cuando volvió a hacerse análisis de sangre dice que los números trajeron alivio: pesaba 81 kilos y los resultados eran los mismos de sus 20 años.

Una tarde mientras arreglaba el techo de su casa vio en el terreno del vecino unos fierros que le parecieron por su forma a una bicicleta. Estaban tapados con tierra arbustos y cubiertos de pasto. Al consultarle al vecino si era una bicicleta este le respondió que sí que era de su padre que había fallecido hacía más de 30 años y que estaba enterrada en estado de abandono desde 1968 . Diego se conmovió con la historia y cuando supo que el vecino había contratado un contenedor para tirarla junto a otros fierros viejos en una limpieza del terreno se animó a pedírsela. “Llevatela pibe” lo animó el vecino y a través de un paredón le pasó la bicicleta que en las manos de Diego se convirtieron en un manojo de caños oxidados tierra agua e insectos de todo tipo.

Lentamente la fue arreglando. No fue fácil: debió tirar las ruedas la cadena el piñón y el plato. Pero el cuadro manubrio pedales guardabarros y asiento fueron restaurados. “Esa bicicleta inglesa de 1941 que había estado cinco décadas enterrada que había fallecido con su dueño (Don Luis Dántola) empezó a tomar forma y vida. Los primeros recorridos fueron cercanos : a las playas de Berisso de Palo Blanco Bagliardi y Municipal. Despues comencé a visitar barrios de Berisso Ensenada y La Plata. Siempre con barbijo alcohol en gel y los cuidados necesarios. En poco tiempo había visitado todos los barrios del gran La Plata. Me transformé en un aventurero amateur cuando antes de eso la bici era algo que no existía en mi vida” enfatiza quien es padre de un hijo de 18 años está casado con Laura y a la vez es hijo de Domingo y Olga parte de una generación de inmigrantes en Berisso.

A los viejos fierros ingleses los bautizó como “Negrita” y dice que por estadísticas que pudo recopilar se trata de la bicicleta más antigua actualmente en el país en haber recorrido tantos kilómetros. Sus postales abarcan el Río de La Plata a lo ancho y a lo largo desde Punta Indio hasta Tigre todos los barrios porteños y los puntos sur norte y oeste del conurbano bonaerense capaz de entrar a la Villa 31 como a la Isla Maciel como de llegar a la puerta de la Quinta de Olivos a las ruinas de una estación de tren abandonada en medio de la llanura bonaerense a bares históricos o a circuitos culturales de los pueblos chicos. En todos y cada uno de ellos la “Negrita” es la testigo que encabeza los álbumes: ya armó cerca de 400 historias entre textos y fotos volviendo a enamorarse del oficio de contar historias.

En su mirada las aventuras más apasionantes parecen surgir de los sitios cercanos aquellos que por una u otra razón suelen ser olvidados por los mismos pobladores. Como una suerte de los diarios de motocicleta aquel mítico registro del Che Guevara Diego cuenta en su Facebook los detalles de su transformación personal en cada experiencia que vive. En su caso sale con lo básico: una botella de agua la SUBE por si debe hacer algún trasbordo en tren documentos y un kit para la bicicleta. “Lo primero que pensé con mi experiencia fue la cuestión del consumo. Vivimos en una sociedad del reemplazo inmediato de las cosas donde hay que comprar gastar y reemplazar todo el tiempo lo viejo por lo nuevo. Esta bicicleta estaba por ser destruida y volvió a salir al ruedo para contar nuevas historias. Intento divertirme ser feliz formarme y aprender que con poquito podemos pasarla bien”.

Dice que no busca romantizar la pobreza ni demonizar a las clases pudientes pero que con la bicicleta se propuso sobre todo entrar en asentamientos y villas para conocerlas de cerca para ir más allá del relato estigmatizante que algunos medios de comunicación suelen construir sobre sus habitantes. “Me encontré con historias de laburantes de gente amable que comparte lo poco que tiene. Siempre buscando el lado humano. En la Villa 21 los nenitos corrían detrás de la bicicleta me mostraban los distintos pasillos. Donde peor la pasé fue en Puerto Madero donde unos policías me pidieron documentos. Lo que parece bello es a veces donde peor lo pasás. Y lo que parece muy negativo es donde mejor la pasé”.

“Nuestro primer paseo del 2021 fue en bicicleta hasta Plaza Moreno de La Plata” posteó a comienzos de año pasado en su Facebook. En sus viajes suele armar un texto a modo casi de guía turístico. “Allí se encuentra la Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepción reconocida por El Vaticano como una de las 10 más importantes del mundo. Los primeros ladrillos comenzaron a levantarse en 1885 y la idea inicial era que sus 112 metros de altura permitieran que la Catedral sea admirada desde cualquier punto del trazado de la ciudad y alrededores. Tal es así que es el templo neogótico más importante del continente sudamericano y la construcción religiosa más alta de toda América”.

Luego en un paseo por el Bosque platense posó ante murales y estatuas de Carlos Gardel René Favaloro y Diego Maradona. “Probablemente junto con el Papa Francisco son los máximos embajadores culturales y héroes modernos que ha tenido la Argentina en los últimos 150 años. Cada uno en su área son mis mayores referentes. Le sumaría a Perón Evita el Che y el Pampa Larralde” cuenta Diego fanático de Villa San Carlos y trabajador del Astillero Río Santiago.

Su amor por el fútbol lo ha llevado además a ser turista ocasional de las canchas de la Liga Amateur Platense. Allí también encontró diferencias de clase. “Consideré que los clubes son un instrumento de representación identidad contención e integración y que la Liga me ayudaba a conocer mejor los barrios. Observé el crecimiento de muchas instituciones que hace veinte años estaban dando los primeros pasos algunas de las cuales sólo tenían fútbol infantil. Pero el saldo fue preocupante en barriadas populares que sobreviven el día a día con pocos servicios y calles intransitables. Hablando con ellos noté pocas expectativas de crecimiento social. Son personas que hacen lo que pueden para comer que merecen mejores condiciones de vida laburantes que se rompen el alma y por ahí no alcanza y habitan en casas precarias donde se padece el frío la lluvia o el calor. Sobre todo me dio tristeza ver a tantos pibitos trabajando lejos del goce que significa la infancia o adolescencia. Y ellos los que peor la pasan son quienes mejor me trataron ofreciéndome agua un inflador para la bici empanadas un choripán. Esa nobleza te llena el corazón”.

Diego es pragmático y no se anda con vueltas: dice que lo único que le interesa es continuar recorriendo los pueblos de Buenos Aires y mantener la bicicleta en estado para sus próximos trayectos.

Lo que empezó como una pequeña aventura para mejorar su estado físico y salud fue creciendo en pasos que tejió solo en el camino: primero conoció su pueblo más en detalle luego las ciudades cercanas y después se extendió hasta las grandes urbes. Hoy quiere seguir descubriendo historias cotidianas encontrar la singularidad en lo ordinario.

Sus registros lo llevan a pensar que ya recorrió toda la región del Capital Federal y el gran Buenos Aires y ahora desea conocer otras provincias como Santa Fe y Córdoba y sobre todo la Ruta 40: sería el primer argentino en hacerlo con una bicicleta de esa antigüedad.

“Me escribe gente alentándome en la experiencia para que no decaiga en mi aventura y en cada posteo la gente suma sus comentarios construyendo un relato colectivo. Como ciclista no me interesa hacer un ejemplo de andar en bicicleta ni querer romper récords ni sumarme a grupos profesionales que buscan la excelencia. Es simplemente darle vida a un objeto tan antiguo y tan sano como un rodado de dos ruedas que nos hace mejorar el cuerpo estar al aire libre en contacto con la naturaleza. Y sobre todo en contacto con la gente de a pie en un tiempo de hostilidad de contaminación ambiental de estrés de desconfianza en el vecino de temor a vincularse socialmente. Contagiar esa experiencia y descubrir nuevas historias en mi oficio de comunicador para mí ya es gratificante”.

Leer no es equivalente a un ejercicio disciplinario y mucho menos de tortura. Un libro debe ser interesante para ser leído disfrutado y recomendado. Mujer en papel Memorias inconclusas de Rita Macedo es además de interesante un libro muy honesto y generoso lejos de derrumbar ídolos solo los regresa a su dimensión humana.

Mujer en papel ha tenido cuatro ediciones y ha sido Libro del Año desde su debut en 2019 es decir ha sido uno de los libros más leídos en 2020 2021 y lo será este 2022. Un logro que no han tenido los textos de su papá textos experimentales hasta límites casi ilegibles cuando menos para mí. Los de él textos incluidos en planes de estudio…pero no disfrutados. ¿Quién lo hubiera imaginado? La hija supera al padre su libro es magnífico.

Por si no lo viste | Novela negra para gourmands

Claro las críticas a Mujer en papel también son interesantes: “no faltan la infidencia ni la maledicencia” ni “los deslices sintácticos” tampoco es “un libro de literatura es de memorias” (como si las memorias “femeninas” no fueran literatura) “es un libro triste lleno de culpas” “ajuste de cuentas de una hija abandonada”. ¡Para nada! Mujer en papel es un libro de dos mujeres madre e hija de su gran amor y de lo difícil de su relación.

Este año el próximo 6 de diciembre se cumplirán treinta años del suicidio de Rita Macedo. Cuenta Cecilia Fuentes que Mujer en papel tuvo una gestación de esas mismas tres décadas. Desde el mismo día en que la actriz mexicana salió de su casa en Galeana en San Ángel para dispararse dos veces porque no murió con el primer disparo hasta que su hija tuvo el libro en sus manos.

Como toda escritura Mujer en papel fue para Cecilia Fuentes Macedo un libro terapéutico y catártico por fin encontró a su verdadero papá y de paso valoró más a su mamá. Ahora los tres están en paz y nosotras tenemos un libro para leer y releer y tal vez animarnos a escribir nuestra propia biografía familiar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsdW5pdmVyc2FsLmNvbS9lbnRyZXRlbmltaWVudG8vMTE1OTY0L2FyaWFuYS1nb2RveS11bmEtbXVqZXItZXhpdG9zYS1tb2xlc3Rh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ariana Godoy: “Una mujer exitosa molesta”,"



















Godoy casi no da entrevistas; sin embargo la emoción de compartir con el público de su país permitió esta conversación con desde su apartamento en Carolina del Norte Estados Unidos donde vive hace más de seis años y comparte la escritura con su trabajo de maestra. Al igual que muchos venezolanos se fue por una oportunidad de trabajo pues ya llevaba varios años trabajando en un colegio público en el Zulia sin recibir ningún salario. En su estudio rodeada de bibliotecas de color blanco donde tiene los libros de sus compañeras escritoras en Wattpad no para de hablar es extrovertida y su humor tan peculiar hace difícil que uno no se conecte con una mujer que también ha tenido que vivir con el éxito y sus consecuencias: la depresión los prejuicios y los haters. Su mayor fortaleza dice han sido sus lectores y su pasión por la escritura.-Ya me he acostumbrado. Primero porque escribo en un género la literatura juvenil que tiene un estigma desde hace mucho tiempo; segundo por el hecho de ser mujer lamentablemente hay ciertos ámbitos del arte donde una mujer exitosa molesta y tercero lo hago en una plataforma online que tiene la etiqueta de ser mala literatura. Sin embargo muchas adolescentes se me acercan para decirme que empezaron a leer gracias a mis libros; también mamás: “Mi hija jamás había tocado un libro en la vida”. Así que a pesar de las críticas mi mayor logro es ser esa primera puerta para la lectura queremos que los jóvenes lean y empiecen a descubrir y disfrutar el mundo de la literatura. Estoy muy orgullosa de lo que hago y escribo.-Sí y más cuando no has estudiado nada relacionado. He visto cómo mis libros han llegado a las librerías del país eso me emociona mucho y es gracias al poder de los lectores que a veces subestimamos.-Nunca lo hice con la intención de tener una carrera como escritora; era algo que tenía oculto ni siquiera mi familia sabía que escribía hasta que una editorial Planeta publicó mi novela. Todo empezó cuando vi que todo el mundo escribía en la plataforma sin problemas revisé mis diarios y me atreví la gente poco a poco fue llegando y le gustaba mi trabajo. Doce años después aquí estamos.-Todo el mundo estaba escribiendo historias de vampiros así que me uní al tren. En esa época pensaba distinto no tenía idea de lo que estaba haciendo se nota en la trama. Soy muy autocrítica uno cuando escribe crece en cada página en cada capítulo. Hasta los momentos mi último libro es el mejor que he escrito pero esa opinión cambiará con los próximos.-Cuando empecé en Wattpad casi todo estaba escrito en inglés había pocos libros en español además estaba terminando la universidad así que me servía para practicar el idioma. Después me costó mucho escribir en español porque las estructuras gramaticales en ambos idiomas son muy distintas.-Quería ser sincera con mis lectores y mostrar mi lado humano ellos son mi familia. Empecé a crecer muy rápido me costó aprender que habrá gente a la que le gustará tu trabajo y otra a la que no y eso está bien es la función del arte y cada quien es libre de interpretarlo como quiera. Al principio sí te afecta y dudas es difícil manejar eso especialmente por mi salud mental. Puedes tener cien comentarios pero el negativo es el que te afecta. Enme desahogué casi toda mi experiencia la puse en el personaje principal es un libro al que le tengo mucho cariño. En mis libros hablo sobre el amor y el romance pero también toco temas serios como la salud mental el abuso sexual...-La productora Nostromo Pictures creyó en el proyecto y en el libro. Siempre tomaron en cuenta mi opinión. Me enviaron los guiones para que los leyera me consultaron sobre el casting. Yo ya vi la película que se rodó entre marzo y abril del año pasado y me parece que el trabajo quedó espectacular. El día del estreno sé que será una locura por cómo la van a recibir mis lectores el fandom y la gente.-No para nada. Nunca me imaginé que mis libros estuvieran publicados por una de las editoriales más grande del mundo o que aparecieran en la lista de los más vendidos al lado de gente que respeto mucho. Te preguntas: ""¿Lo merezco?"".

The planned acquisition of rocket engine firm Aerojet Rocketdyne has already drawn major scrutiny owing to allegations that it will give Lockheed an unfair competitive edge in the highly-concentrated missile defense propulsion and hypersonic development market.

Aerojet Rocketdyne is an American rocket and missile-propulsion manufacturer. It is also involved in the ongoing research to develop hypersonic weapons as well as a variety of other munitions targets and undersea systems.

According to the latest reports the US Federal Trade Commission which reviews mergers and acquisitions has postponed a vote on Lockheed Martin’s bid to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne for up to two weeks.

The vote was originally scheduled for midweek the report said adding that the delay would give the FTC additional time to analyze the merger’s conditions. Aerojet shares were up more than 3% in after-hours trading on January 11 as investors saw the delay as a good indicator for the proposed merger the report added.

The $4.4 billion agreement announced in late 2020 is Lockheed’s first major acquisition bid under new CEO Jim Taiclet. In October 2021 the company stated that the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2022.

Lockheed Martin the largest US defense contractor says it reached a deal valued at $4.4 billion to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne a supplier of engines to NASA’s Space Launch System moon rocket and United Launch Alliance’s Atlas Delta and Vulcan rockets. https://t.co/gWtjxvc03b pic.twitter.com/WYRphowIDZ — Spaceflight Now (@SpaceflightNow) December 21 2020

The deal is anticipated to reshape the US defense sector as it would allow the country’s top defense contractor to acquire a major provider of solid-fuel rocket motors. Aerojet’s customers include the Pentagon NASA Boeing Lockheed Martin Raytheon Technologies and the United Launch Alliance.

In June 2021 Aerojet successfully tested a full-scale advanced solid rocket motor as part of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s hypersonic missile program. If the acquisition goes through Lockheed Martin will also have a strong foothold in hypersonic missile development.

Concerns About The Deal

If federal antitrust officials approve this deal experts believe that it will trigger issues in the tactical and strategic offensive missile industries. It would also exacerbate rivalry in the missile defense area by transferring ownership of Aerojet’s solid rocket motor (SRM) production capacity to Lockheed.

SRMs the cutting-edge technology for pushing missiles toward their targets are employed in nearly all missile systems purchased by the US government. Following the Northrop Grumman acquisition of propulsion company Orbital ATK in 2018 Aerojet is the sole surviving independent manufacturer of this crucial propulsion technology.

It is said that Lockheed’s monopoly of Aerojet’s SRM technology would be troublesome since there are only three other businesses that are strong enough to compete against Lockheed as prime contractors for US government missile system deals. All major companies are dependent on Aerojet as a supplier of propulsion components for their solutions.

Raytheon Technologies in particular has openly expressed concern that the merger will force it to rely on a direct rival for most of the propulsion in its missile products. Aerojet Rocketdyne for example is a supplier of solid rocket motors as well as military technology like hypersonic engines.

Furthermore Aerojet is the sole manufacturer of the Divert and Attitude Control System an essential missile defense propulsion technology that allows interceptors to make quick and precise course modifications in order to kill incoming ballistic missiles.

Lockheed’s Forays Into Hypersonic Domain

The development of hypersonic missiles in the United States has accelerated in recent years since China and Russia have lately demonstrated their capabilities. Lockheed Martin is a key player in hypersonic missile technology.

In October 2021 the company opened a new advanced hypersonic missile factory in Courtland Alabama. A month later the Pentagon selected Lockheed Northrop Grumman and Raytheon to research and develop a missile system that would be able to defend the US against potential hypersonic weapons attacks by hostile nations.

Lockheed Martin’s chief financial officer Ken Possenriede earlier argued “vertically integrating Lockheed Martin’s missile manufacturing business with the propulsion supplier would improve the engineering process and reduce the fees that are charged to the government when products are bought from subcontractors.”

The potential acquisition of the Aerojet will undoubtedly boost the chances of Lockheed to fast-track the process as occurred in the instance of Northrop. Orbital ATK was the major provider of solid rocket motors and Northrop Grumman’s acquisition of the firm helped the corporation achieve a commanding lead in the competition for the Air Force’s next-generation intercontinental ballistic missile. Boeing dropped out of the missile program and Northrop won the race.

Raytheon also made similar claims that Lockheed Martin’s ownership of Aerojet would give them a significant edge in future DoD procurements of ballistic and hypersonic missiles. Aerojet would be the major propulsion provider for hypersonic missiles be it ramjet-powered air-breathing missiles or boost-glide vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpc2hmYXJtaW5nZXhwZXJ0LmNvbS9hbWVyamFjay1icmF6aWwtZm9yZXZlci1vY2VhbnMvdXMtZmlzaC1mYXJtZXItd2lucy1iaWdnZXN0LWV2ZXItY29uY2Vzc2lvbi1vZmYtYnJhemlsLzEzMTgyMTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US fish farmer wins biggest-ever concession off Brazil,"Forever Oceans will raise seriola rivoliana – known by several names including amberjack longfin yellowtail and in Brazil as ‘Olho de Boi’ or remeiro – in automated cages in two zones between 4.3-9.3 miles off the coast of the Brazilian state of Bahia.

Together the zones total an area three and a half times the size of Washington DC.

Forever Oceans’ chief executive Bill Bien centre left with mask and Brazil aquaculture and fisheries minister Jorge Seif Junior centre right.

“With a coastline of more than 8500 km Brazil is one of the main frontiers for fish production generating in addition to healthy food employment and income” said the country’s aquaculture and fisheries minister Jorge Seif Junior.

“This landmark agreement is historic for Brazil and will set the country on the path to the development of sustainable marine aquaculture.”

Space to grow

Forever Oceans’ chief executive Bill Bien said the agreement gave the Virginia-headquartered company the space to scale and grow rapidly and the opportunity to develop the largest offshore sustainable seafood capability in the world.

“We will bring our different approach to the waters of Brazil applying our expertise in aquaculture conservation and innovation to raise delicious and protein-rich fish in deep-ocean waters in a highly environmentally-friendly and sustainable way that’s good for people and the planet” added Bien in a press release.

Forever Oceans has a research and technology facility in Hawai’i and farms amberjack in offshore operations in Panama. It is also planning an offshore operation in Indonesia.

For the past decade Manila has been trying to modernize its run-down military equipment featuring Vietnam War-era helicopters and World War II naval vessels used by the United States.

The first of the 32 S-70i Black Hawks from a Polish firm owned by US defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin will begin to arrive next year Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said on Facebook.

The aircraft were needed for humanitarian assistance and disaster response he said.

“The lack of transport planes and helicopters have never been more acute during the pandemic and in the aftermath of Typhoon Odette” Lorenzana said using the local name of Typhoon Rai which left more than 400 people dead and caused widespread devastation when it hit the country in December.

“This was exacerbated by our aging Hueys that have become uneconomical to maintain.”

The government last year completed an order of 16 S-70i Black Hawks to replace the air force’s fleet of Bell UH-1H helicopters commonly known as the Huey after fatal accidents.

Many of them were acquired as surplus from the United States Manila’s longtime military ally.

The entire Black Hawk fleet was grounded in June after an S-70i helicopter crashed during a night-time training flight killing all six on board. An investigation found it “inadvertently entered a thunderstorm” and the pilot suffered “spatial disorientation or vertigo.”

As well as long-running insurgencies by communist and Islamist fighters the Philippines faces growing Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.

Lorenzana announced Friday the Philippines would buy an anti-ship missile system from India for nearly $375 million that would boost its defense capability.

That came weeks after the country ordered two new warships from South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries in a $556 million deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QveC0yNGMtaHlwZXJzb25pYy1haXJjcmFmdC0xOTcwcy0xOTkzOTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The X-24C: Hypersonic Aircraft of the 1970s,"Here’s What You Need to Remember: Had the X-24C been successful in testing America would likely have leveraged scramjet technology in more platforms.

Today scramjet propulsion is the subject of continued study as it appears to be one of the most promising methods of powering hypersonic weapons and aircraft. So you may be surprised to learn that Lockheed was actually pursuing the idea of scramjet-powered hypersonic aircraft more than four decades ago.

Hypersonic is a term used to refer to vehicles that travel at speeds in excess of Mach 5.

By the end of 1968 the rocket-powered X-15 program had run its course leaving the U.S. Air Force without any hypersonic aircraft in testing or development. That’s where Kelly Johnson’s team at the legendary Lockheed Skunk Works entered the picture.

Taking on the role of lead contractor Lockheed worked side by side with the Air Force’s National Hypersonic Flight Research Facility and NASA to develop and field two hypersonic test aircraft with each vehicle slated for 100 flights. The decision was made to equip this new “L-301” program’s aircraft unofficially dubbed the X-24C with a new LR-105 rocket engine found at the time in the Atlas series of rockets. The LR-105 would launch and accelerate the X-24C to hypersonic speeds not unlike the rocket engine in the X-15. From there a second hydrogen-fueled air-breathing ram/scramjet (supersonic-combustion ramjet) engine mounted on its belly would take over.

Scramjet Propulsion and Hypersonic Velocities

The scramjet engine would propel the X-24C at sustained speeds in excess of Mach 6 reaching intended peak speeds that were higher than Mach 8 or more than 6130 miles per hour. The aircraft itself resembled the lifting body design leveraged by the Martin Marietta X-24A and B programs that tested unpowered reentry flight characteristics.

That scramjet propulsion concept is still widely considered to be the most likely candidate for hypersonic aircraft to this day. A normal jet engine uses a compressor section (fan blades) to compress air to be mixed with fuel and ignited but at hypersonic velocities that compressor becomes a hindrance slowing airflow to subsonic speeds as it passes through.

A scramjet in its simplest form uses the immense pressure created by air flowing into the engine at supersonic speeds to handle compression making it a far more efficient means of propulsion at such high velocities. According to NASA scramjets can be good for speeds up to “at least Mach 15” and NASA scramjets have been successfully flight tested at speeds as high as Mach 9.6 (in the X-43A experimental unmanned hypersonic aircraft).

Had the X-24C been successful in testing America would likely have leveraged scramjet technology in more platforms. And while hypothetical-history isn’t good for much more than conversation at dinner parties it seems awfully likely that with continued testing in this realm the U.S. wouldn’t now find itself lagging behind nations like Russia and China in fielding operational hypersonic weapons. China and Russia both have hypersonic weapons in service today with America hoping to follow suit in 2022.

But to extend that theorizing beyond missile technology Lockheed’s Skunk Works were legends in their own time in the 1960s and ’70s for fielding the most groundbreaking military aircraft the world had ever seen. If anyone could make a hypersonic aircraft leveraging a combination of conventional and scramjet propulsion work in the 1970s the guys who were making rocket-assisted F-80 fighters in the ’50s and the space-scraping SR-71 in the ’60s probably could.

But by the end of 1977 the L-301 program and its notional X-24C were canceled. Lockheed’s approach to hypersonics it seemed wouldn’t be the next revolution in aviation technology. Instead it was a different design floating around the very same Skunk Works offices that was about to change military aviation forever. But while hypersonic aircraft flying at the edge of space might have seemed awfully promising at the time this other program started out a bit more… hopeless.

Last weekend 8 and 9 January 2022 was a busy one for two of the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II squadrons based at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (AZ).

Both Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 122 Flying Leathernecks ('DC-xx') and Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 225 Vikings ('CE-xx') went out on mini-deployments.

On Friday 7 January 2022 four F-35Bs of VMFA-122 arrived at Hill AFB (UT) for training with the F-35As of the 419th Fighter Wing US Air Force Reserves.

On Saturday a total of eight Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) missions were flown by all four F-35Bs alongside fourteen local F-35As.The Flying Leathernecks departed Hill on Sunday morning 8 January 2022.

The four VMFA-122 F-35Bs that visited Hill AFB were: 169616/DC-03 169697/DC-05 169794/DC-07 and 169795/DC-08

Over at Gowen Field ANGB in Boise (ID) four F-35B Lightning IIs of VMFA-225 arrived on Friday 7 January 2022 for training with the local based A-10Cs of the 190th Fighter Squadron Idaho ANG. It was the first time that the A-10Cs of the 190th FS had an opportunity to train with the F-35.

For VMFA-225 the training was successful for several reasons. Lt. Col. Alexander “Steamer” Goodno Commanding Officer of VMFA-225 explains “First was to provide exposure to operating from an unfamiliar airfield. As the Marine Corps’ newest operational F-35B squadron we are pushing to get young pilots used to operating in and around areas where they may not be comfortable. Gowen Field provided us with exactly that: new airspace cold weather considerations unfamiliar area increased likelihood of flying in and out of weather; while still satisfying many of the security requirements needed for basing the F-35B out of home station. In addition with the 190th FS based there it also allowed us to work 4th and 5th generation aircraft integration while leveraging the great assets available to us within the Mountain Home Range Complex.”

Lt. Col. Goodno continues “Our training over the weekend focused on close air support (CAS) in a contested environment. Similar to the type of scenario that we will likely find ourself in when competing with a peer adversary we trained in scenarios where surface-to-air missile systems provided prohibitive interference; requiring the suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) capability of the F-35 to create a permissive environment whereby the A-10s were then able to take airspace authority as a forward air controller (airborne) and conduct CAS with both A10s and F-35s supporting in CAS roles. By executing a training scenario like this we increased exposure across both the 190th FS and VMFA-225 in 4th and 5th generation integration and joint service operations; specifically the capabilities that each aircraft brings to the fight and how each service approaches a given problem set. Through mission planning academics flights and debriefs we gained significant familiarity in where we can each maximize the other’s aircraft platform so as to be a more lethal and decrease time to kill on the battle field.”

The 190th FS and VMFA-225 flew three missions together after which the Vikings returned home again on Sunday 9 January 2022.

The four VMFA-225 F-35Bs that visited Gowen Field ANGB were: 169916 (unmarked) 169609/07 (unmarked) 169296/CE-04 and 169297/CE-05

Despite his mild almost professorial appearance the 40-year-old had developed a rock-star reputation for his daring and virtuosity and was known within the profession as “the Mutant” or “Lungs with Legs” on account of his remarkable strength and stamina. Anker though a gifted climber himself had spent most of his career in the shadow of his best friend. But there was no resentment.

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021. After a fantastic start that had the Bulls leading the Eastern Conference in 2021-22 Ball averaged 13.0 points 5.4 rebounds 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals before a knee injury 35 games into the season.

His inactivity has caused his contract to become a blight on the Bulls' salary cap.

Ball was the No. 2 overall pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2017 NBA draft and eventually was traded to the Pelicans as part of the Anthony Davis blockbuster deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tdXNpYy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA1L2ZyZWUtbWFkb25uYS1jb25jZXJ0LWRyYXdzLWNyb3dkLW9mLTE2bS10by1icmF6aWxzLWNvcGFjYWJhbmEtYmVhY2jSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbXVzaWMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wNS9mcmVlLW1hZG9ubmEtY29uY2VydC1kcmF3cy1jcm93ZC1vZi0xNm0tdG8tYnJhemlscy1jb3BhY2FiYW5hLWJlYWNo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free Madonna concert draws crowd of 1.6m to Brazil’s Copacabana beach,"With the world-famous statue towering over it from Corcovado mountain Rio de Janeiro is well used to Christ the Redeemer. For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Italy opened with $1.4M at No.2 in the market; a strong run is expected. Korea started with $1.1M ranking No. 3 behind local blockbuster The Roundup: Punishment and Kung Fu Panda 4. Sunday evening was boosted by the national holiday on Monday with a view on a good run ahead. The weekend excluding previews is in line with Bullet Train and well above The Lost City.

Here are the Top 5 markets through Sunday: China ($131.3M) Mexico ($33.2M) UK ($17.5M) India ($15.2M) and Australia ($12M).

After crossing $500M global last weekend Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s Kung Fu Panda 4 pocketed another $7.7M for a running overseas cume of $331.7M. The performance excluding China is in line with Zootopia and above HTTYD3 and KFP2 at the same point. The international box office has also topped KFP3 and Sing 2 as well as Ice Age: Collision Course. Worldwide the total so far is $520M.

Notably China enjoyed 36% uplift in weekend 7 boosted by the Labor Day national holidays that ran from Wednesday to Sunday. With $50.2M as it heads into further extended play that will stretch to June 21 the fourquel has topped the market lifetimes of Incredibles 2 Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Despicable Me 2 Frozen Finding Dory Sing Toy Story 4 Moana and Minions: The Rise of Gru.

Interim President Jeff Ettinger’s budget for the next fiscal year proposes to slap a 4.5 percent tuition hike on in-state undergraduate students studying at the Twin Cities campus. If approved by the Board of Regents that would be the highest annual tuition increase for Minnesota residents since 2010.

Students at other campuses would also pay more money.

“Tuition increases always suck” said Blake Barrington a freshman. “I think sometimes the fault is on the university for spending it needlessly. There’s a lot of clubs and activities that the university funds that I don’t think are necessarily needed.""

Create a More Connected Minnesota MPR News is your trusted resource for the news you need. With your support MPR News brings accessible courageous journalism and authentic conversation to everyone - free of paywalls and barriers. Your gift makes a difference.

At least two members of the Board of Regents seem reluctant to embrace the proposed increase.

“I only learned that we were considering a tuition increase this weekend” wrote Robyn Gulley who represents the Second Congressional District in an email to MPR News. “I have not been convinced that increasing tuition for our students — compelling many to take additional loans or work longer hours to make tuition payments — will benefit our whole university more than it will harm our students. I expect to vote no on this proposed tuition increase.”

James Farnsworth a regent representing St. Paul hadn’t heard about the proposed tuition hikes until he read about in the newspaper on Friday.

“In general I’m not supportive of putting our budgetary pressures on the backs of our students right now” he wrote in an email. “But [I] haven’t digested the proposal enough to be knowledgeable comment on it.”

In real terms the total increase in tuition room and board and fees for Minnesota residents would raise costs by an additional $453 to $1552 per year depending on the campus. For Twin Cities undergrads who reside in-state tuition could increase by 4.5 percent to $15148.

The U has consistently raised tuition across campuses but in recent years has not exceeded annual hikes of 2-3 percent for locals. Proposed residential raises at other U campuses range from 1.5 to 4.5 percent and are anticipated to bring in $42.2 million in revenue.

“A large part of coming from in-state and going to the U is the fact that the tuition is a lot more affordable” said freshman Adella Mulawarman. “I’m curious to see if they go ahead and increase it if there will be a difference in how many in-state students decide to attend here.”

Thanks to scholarships Mulawarman got a break on tuition this year. But those scholarships are drying up and next year she’s worried about having to take out loans.

Tuition hikes could be incoming for out-of-state students too where the track record for an increasing price tag has been steeper. At the Twin Cities campus non-resident undergraduates could face a 5.5 percent tuition increase bringing tuition to $36296. A decade ago tuition was just over $19000 for non-residents.

In a Star Tribune Op-Ed last month regents Janie S. Mayeron Douglas A. Huebsch and Kenyanya urged state legislators to approve the U’s funding request to help cover the cost for students and employee pay.

“As a nonprofit public university our recurring operating fund request will minimize tuition increases for students and families who should not shoulder the burden of the state’s diminishing support” they wrote. “It will also help provide our 27000 faculty and staff members systemwide with fair compensation and the facilities they need to remain competitive in the workforce. They all deserve support by state leaders.”

Students who choose U housing may also have to anticipate higher room and board costs at all campuses. That change is “primarily driven by inflationary cost pressures” according to the proposal.

At the Duluth campus standard room and board costs could go up by 8.9 percent bringing the typical total to $10456 per year. In the Twin Cities that’s a 6.5 percent increase bringing room and board totals up to $13606.

A 6 percent increase is proposed at Morris 5.2 percent at Rochester and 2.8 percent at Crookston.

The attendance cost hikes are paired with proposed expense reductions of $13.7 million. The bulk of that reduction is planned through eliminating positions after employees leave and hiring replacement employees at lower salaries.

Additional expense reductions are proposed through scaling back in-person events and conferences reducing certain research and educational programs and shrinking food and supply budgets in some departments.

The public is welcome to comment on the proposal at the U Regents meeting Friday or online through the morning of June 7. The 12-member Board of Regents are expected to vote on the final budget in June."

Marriott Bonvoy Removes Air and Hotel Redemption Program

Another segment in the world’s least funny joke Marriott Bonvoy has removed yet another valuable piece of their once reasonably valuable loyalty program. The Air and Hotel redemption program was one of the few last bright spots in a program hell-bent on deeming itself worthless to participants. The Air and Hotel program allowed Bonvoy participants to redeem their points for category hotel stays and a bulk of miles for their preferred airline to package the entire trip together.

One of the off-peak charts looked like this before the rug was ripped from underneath its loyal guests:

Due to airline transfer rates the Marriott Bonvoy program conveys one mile/airline point per three Bonvoy points (before bonuses) made those category 1-4 redemptions free on the right side of the column with 110000 airline points distributed. Granted in most cases the hotel brands available in the 1-4 category are more likely to be an airport Fairfield Inn rather than a Ritz-Carlton but just another 60000 points (or 8571/night) would have opened up some relatively strong hotels like the Le Meridien Maldives.

None of that matters now.

On Wednesday January 12th 2022 Marriott International announced that one week later (January 19th 2022) the program would be terminated. Smart travelers can still burn their ever-declining Bonvoy points for flight and hotel vacation packages but the time to do so is vanishing quickly.

Latest In Long List of Value Reductions

For elite status holders still frequenting Marriott hotels… my sympathies. The hotel rewards program has done seemingly everything short of shutting down the program altogether to disincentivize loyal guests from wanting to continue to earn Marriott Bonvoy points. Here are just some highlights:

Established a new elite tier (Ambassador) requiring 100 nights and $20000 on hotel spend (excluding taxes and fees) with a dedicated Ambassador. Removed direct access to ambassadors Reduced the number of ambassador employees Service return times are more or less “we’ll get back to you” for these top tier customers

Introduced Peak/Off-Peak rewards for free nights increasing the cost for most desirable stays Not to worry they are doing away with award charts completely in 2023.

Breakfast benefits seem simple on paper but require a secret decoder ring to decipher when and where they are offered

Upgrades to the best available suite at check-in upgrades no longer state “best available” and in many cases are simply a larger room or a desirable floor if honored at all

“Guaranteed” late checkout is offered at 2-4 pm for elites but not at resorts or convention centers or if unavailable…

General devaluation of points

Most of these benefits do not apply to Ritz-Carlton even though those guests may have earned their Bonvoy status via Ritz-Carlton stays.

What’s Left of Marriott Bonvoy?

This will be the shortest section of this blog post. There’s not a lot of unique value left. Marriot Rewards was fairly competitive and even pioneered reciprocal status with airlines (United.) The Starwood Preferred Guest program was unquestionably the leader in the space and initially Marriott retained many aspects of this program.

There are some bright spots that remain. Bonvoy Moments (formerly SPG Moments) has come back and offers value. The ability to convert hotel certificates earned from credit cards to points is a nice benefit and one others should consider.

The last remaining benefit that really matters is the conversion bonus when transferring Bonvoy points to airlines. At present that bonus (a holdover from SPG) is a 20% bonus per 60000 transferred. For example if a remaining Marriott Bonvoy member transfers 60000 points to an airline the normal rate (3:1) puts 20000 miles/points into their airline account but with the 20% bonus the recipient will actually receive 25000 miles.

Conclusion

Marriott has complete disregard for its loyal members. Some deserve sympathy but that’s running out as they’ve had every indication that Bonvoy is no longer a program worth earning points. Some might be stuck due to their company commitments involvement in the Marriott Vacation Club or undying love for genuinely lovely properties that have done nothing to contribute to Bonvoy’s assault on its own program. However for those that find themselves traveling to major metro areas like Washington DC San Francisco London Mexico City Beijing or similar – it’s likely time to try a new chain.

What do you think? Is there a remaining value that I am missing? If you’re still loyal to Marriott why?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9uZXdzLzQxMDg0ODUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remington Hotels and TCOR Hotel Partners Announce New Management Agreement With Springhill Suites Austin ...,"Remington Hotels a leading third-party management company has assumed management of the SpringHill Suites Austin West/Lakeway by Marriott in Lakeway Texas.

Consumers buy pornographic videos of women eating women pretending to fuck their stepsons and women engaged in all sorts of other scenarios. For the past two years a new genre has taken Porn Valley by storm: scenes of men fucking women who are stuck. Take my recent foray into the genre. At the start of the video I pretend to get stuck in a dryer to seduce my fictional stepson then scream: “Oh Randy! Help me I’m stuck!” He runs in and says “Stepmom you are clearly not stuck in the drier; if you want to fuck you should have said so” then pounds me.

Other videos show women stuck in fridges cars garbage disposals and all different sorts of inanimate objects. The videos sound hilarious but in my opinion they exist for a serious reason: Mastercard Visa and other credit card-processing companies restrict what pornographers can sell especially in the genre of fake non-consent which has significantly decreased the amount of high-end content in that genre. Pornographers and consumers are trapped and trapped women videos set us free.

Mastercard has restricted pornographers for years. Although First Amendment laws protect the right to sell fictional films showcasing adult actors in scripted scenes of fake incest or non-consensual sex Mastercard and other financial service companies enforce strict rules about what types of porn consumers can buy with credit and debit cards. These rules range from which fingers I can put in my asshole (no thumbs!) to what types of objects I can insert in my vagina to what a son can and cannot call his mother figure. (Meanwhile Hollywood depicts incest and rape regularly.) In other words Mastercard restricts what you jack off to even if it’s legal for you to watch a woman get fisted.

When adult companies sell fictional non-consensual-themed videos they must add additional language to videos. Kink sometimes sells these videos showing disclaimers both before and after the videos explaining the films are fictional. Instead of tagging them “rape” they now might tag them “consensual non-consent.”

“ Pornographers and consumers are trapped and trapped women videos set us free. ”

Last year Mastercard and OnlyFans changed policies overnight. For most of us it’s not worth risking our relationship with credit card processors to sell fictional consensual non-consent films.

On top of this we’ve all heard from viewers and though their tastes remain as carnal as ever they have mixed feelings about wanting to view fictional incest- or rape-themed content. A woman can have a rape fantasy without ever wanting to get raped and a man who likes stepmom porn probably doesn’t want to sleep with his mother. It’s make-believe. But in a country where you can’t tweet about listening to “Baby It’s Cold Outside” without sparking a viral debate people are wary of publicly talking about their fantasies. Everyone has grown more conservative. And when you’re masturbating you don’t want to remember your weird stance toward your fetishes. You just want to get off and relax.

I have begun filming these stuck women scenes with my fans in mind. Even when creating these videos I must tip-toe around Mastercard rules. If my stepson Randy comes behind me I can’t yell “I don’t want it!” or “Stop!” I must scream euphemisms like “Oh my goodness!” and “This seems wrong but I want it!”

I never thought I would feel more ridiculous than I do when I film regular stepmom scenes (personally stepmoms and rape fantasies are not the type of porn I want) but I laugh when I film these videos. At the same time I’m thankful these videos exist. Stuck women videos offer a way for performers to sell controversial fantasies without breaking Mastercard’s policies or triggering audiences’ self-loathing. Stuck women videos are playful consensual non-consent videos. They’re the fuzzy pink handcuffs of kinky porn compared to the spiked handcuffs of more controversial videos. And some days when I’m battling Mastercard weekly I too prefer the fuzzy pink handcuffs. The spikes are not worth the stress.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcmhsby5jb20vYXNhZC1zaWRkaXF1aS11bmV4cGVjdGVkLWxvc3Mtb2YtY2hpbGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asad Siddiqui Reveals Shocking Details Of His & Zara Noor's Unexpected Loss Of Child,"Celebrity couple Zara Noor Abbas and Asad Siddiqui who starred together in the TV serial Zebaish have been married since 2017. A shocking revelation was recently made by the husband who claimed that they recently lost a child.

The death of a child whether it is due to miscarriage stillbirth or at or after birth brings grief and that is what Zara and Asad had to cope with.

Image: Instagram

In an interview with Fuchsia Magazine Asad discussed how he and his wife tragically lost a child. “We lost a baby a while ago” he said. “It was not a miscarriage. Zara actually delivered a 5-6-month-old baby which I buried myself.”

“We named him Aurangzeb” he added. “It was a good time when we got to know that we are going to have a baby but unfortunately some complications occurred due to which we lost our baby. It was a very difficult time for us especially for Zara. She went through many breakdowns hormonal changes and much more.”

“I was quite depressed but I believe that everything happens with Allah’s will whatever he has written on our fate we will surely get it” he continued. “You never know maybe Allah has written something better for us.”

Have a look at the interview:

Actor Zara Noor Abbas recovered from covid in October last year and celebrated the victory with a photo dump of the things that kept her sane and occupied during her quarantine period.

“Past few days have been tough” she wrote. “Tougher than I thought actually. But you see; coping mechanisms of your body and mind tame you in a way you’d never imagine. Furthermore Allah only puts you in the tests as much as you CAN take – and then while going through it all you pat yourself and realize your inner endurance and strength was always a blow away” she continued.

“Forever grateful for my family for hanging in there with me. Some friends knew what I was going through. Thank you for your love and duas. Hoping for better times now. And trying to make each and every day count. In moments like these is when you realize that life is unpredictable and short. So live it!”

Being from a family where both her mother and aunts have become well-known in the entertainment industry Zara is sometimes called a parchi and in response to that she previously shared how she grew up as a typical middle-class Pakistani girl.

The Pharaohs have suffered a disappointing start in the competition with a 1-0 loss to Nigeria after a poor performance from the Pharaohs putting Carlos Queiroz the head coach and his players under so much criticism from the fans.

Queiroz's tactical approach to the match was not convincing for the fans back home who blamed the coach on the loss as the team was suffering for more than 70 minutes against an organized Nigerian side.

Egypt has a chance to revive their hopes in the competition and restore the trust of the fans against Guinea-Bissau in an encounter that happens for the first time in the history of the competition.

Guinea-Bissau has never tasted the winning joy in AFCON as their seven matches in the history of the competition ended in three draws and four losses.

The Bissau Guineans secured a draw in their opening match in the group against Sudan and they were the closer side to win the match after missing a penalty in the last 10 minutes of the game. They are expected to fight on Saturday to get their first-ever win against the record champions of the competition.

The Pharaohs hope to leave Garoua with three points in the bag as the team will head after the game to the capital Yaounde where they are set to face Sudan in the last group stage game.

The game will start at 9:00 PM ( Cairo Time).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydGluZ25ld3MuY29tL3VzL3NvY2Nlci9uZXdzL2FmY29uLXJlZmVyZWUtY2hhb3MtdHVuaXNpYS1tYWxpLWV4cGxhaW5pbmctd2hhdC1oYXBwZW5lZC8xa2M5YnplZnUyYXNiMXFyeWp2NGI1NnJicNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AFCON referee chaos: Explaining what happened at the end of Tunisia vs. Mali,"The 2022 Africa Cup of Nations group match between Tunisia and Mali ended in chaos after the referee twice opted to whistle the conclusion of the match before the 90 minutes of regulation were up.

Wednesday's match at Omnisport Stadium in Limbe Cameroon was a tense affair and it ended in explosive fashion as Mali emerged from the confusion as 1-0 winners. The Group E opener also featured two penalties and a red card.

An African confederation official has since spoken about what might have led to the issue but the fact remains that the referee opted to blow the full-time whistle early on two separate occasions before attempting to bring the teams back out for additional stoppage time which one team refused outright.

What happened at the end of Tunisia vs. Mali?

While the first half of Tunisia vs. Mali like many AFCON 2022 matches before it was uneventful and ended 0-0 the second half of action was far more entertaining.

Early in the half Mali earned a penalty after VAR review and 22-year-old Sarpsborg striker Ibrahima Kone deposited the spot-kick to put the Eagles in front.

As the half wore on the final 20 minutes exploded. Tunisia was awarded a penalty for a handball in the area and Wahbi Khazri stepped up to take it. Mali goalkeeper Ibrahim Mounkoro was up to the challenge producing a stunning diving save to keep the penalty out.

All this action is notable as we get to the events of the final five minutes of play.

In the 86th minute the referee inexplicably blew his full-time whistle and the Tunisia coaching staff was incensed all pointing to their watches. The referee realized his mistake and the match continued.

Moments later the referee controversially produced a straight red card for Mali's El Bilal Toure for what appeared to be an innocuous challenge. The referee went to the pitchside monitor for a video review of the incident and replays did show Toure step studs-up over the ball and into the shin of a Tunisia player. After review the referee stayed with his initial decision and Tunisia had a few more minutes with a man-up advantage to search for an equalizer.

But then with 89:40 showing on the clock still seconds from full-time and not yet into stoppage time the referee again blew his full-time whistle to end the match.

After two penalties two VAR reviews and a red card shown a healthy chunk of stoppage time would not only be expected but it would be necessary. Yet the official brought the match to a conclusion not only without any additional time but 20 seconds prior to the full 90 minutes of regulation. The Tunisia coaching staff exploded in anger and protested for minutes but it was to no avail. The match was over.

Fallout from the ending of Tunisia vs. Mali

The controversy did not end there.

Some time after the final whistle blew and the teams had exited the playing area the officiating crew realized its mistake. The referees attempted to bring the players of both teams back out onto the field.

It's official: Mali vs Tunisia will resume

Tunisia 🇹🇳 have refused to return to the pitch to play the final five minutes of the game so Mali 🇲🇱 have been declared 1-0 winners. #AFCON2021 — Usher Komugisha (@UsherKomugisha) January 12 2022

""He deprived us of concentration"" said Tunisia head coach Mondher Kebaier after Tunisia's 1-0 defeat as quoted by the AFCON official website via CNN. ""We did not want to resume because the players had already taken their baths deconcentrated and demoralized in the face of this gruesome situation.""

""The players were taking ice baths for 35 minutes before they were called back out again"" Kebaier continued. ""I've been coaching for a long time and never seen anything like it. Even the fourth official was preparing to lift the board [to show the stoppage time] and then the whistle was blown.""

As a result of the controversy the following match between Mauritania and Gambia was postponed by 45 minutes.

In addition Tunisia lodged an official complaint with the African confederation (CAF):

#TeamTunisia have filed a protest to CAF concerning referee Janny Sikazwe. CAF are expected to reply within the next 24 hours.



Grab your popcorn 🍿 — Owuraku Ampofo (@_owurakuampofo) January 12 2022

It's unlikely that Tunisia's complaint will garner more than a mea culpa from CAF after the officials did make an attempt to correct the mistake. From a sporting perspective the only possible options would be to either resume the final five minutes at a later date or replay the match in its entirety and neither would seem like a viable option.

What has the CAF said about Tunisia-Mali?

While many were speculating that the referee had an issue with his timekeeping device or lost track of the time after a hydration break the African federation made a shocking reveal on Thursday after an investigation into the incident. The update sheds some light on what may have occurred.

Head of officiating for CAF Essam Abdel-Fatah stated that the official Janny Sikazwe was suffering from heat stroke and dehydration during the closing stages of the match causing the error to occur. Abdel-Fatah confirmed that Sikazwe was hospitalized after the match for his condition receiving further treatment.

“The referee suffered from heat stroke and very severe dehydration which led to him losing focus and was taken to the hospital” Abdel-Fatah told MBC Egypt’s Al-Laib and quoted by The Independent. “It caused him to lose time in the 80th minute and he ended the match in the 85th minute. He returned after directions from the assistant staff and then returned to finish the match in the 89th minute.

“When the crisis occurred and the objections and control were lost in the match the fourth referee was the one who was going to complete the match [instead of Sikazwe] but one of the two teams refused.”

Temperatures at the stadium in Limbe Cameroon during the match on Wednesday reached 34 degrees Celsius or 93 degrees Farenheit.

The CAF has not yet released its decision on Tunisia's appeal.

Who was the referee in Tunisia vs. Mali?

Referee Janny Sikazwe is not new to controversy.

The Zambian international has been a FIFA-listed official since 2007 with the 2016 Club World Cup final the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations final and two 2018 World Cup matches on his resume. However not all those events went off without a hitch.

In the 2016 Club World Cup final between Real Madrid and Kashima Antlers Sikazwe made headlines as it appeared the official was preparing to show Sergio Ramos a yellow card before realizing he had already booked Ramos previously in the match and subsequently refrained from giving Ramos a second booking.

Sikazwe after the match explained that the confusion came from miscommunication with his assistant referee who spotted the foul with Sikazwe believing to have heard his assistant indicate a card should be shown before it was clarified that his assistant instead had said “no card” over the earpiece.

Just two years later Sikazwe was again under fire for an incident in a CAF Champions League match between Esperance de Tunis and Primeiro de Agosto. After Sikazwe awarded Esperance a controversial penalty early in the match and ruled out a Primeiro goal later a corruption complaint was lodged and Sikazwe was provisionally suspended although he was later cleared for lack of evidence.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9hZnJpY2EvNjAwMTEyNjPSAS9odHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvYWZyaWNhLzYwMDExMjYzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Afcon 2021: Ghana's Benjamin Tetteh and Mali's El Bilal Toure handed bans,"Ghana forward Benjamin Tetteh may not feature again at the Africa Cup of Nations after being handed a three-match ban.

Some football enthusiasts on Friday urged the Super Eagles to ensure victory against Sudan in their second match Group D of the African Cup Nations (AFCON).

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Super Eagles will take on Sudan Falcons of Jediane on Saturday at the Roumde Adjia Stadium Garoua Cameroon.

A cross section of the fans told NAN in separate interviews in Bauchi that it was imperative for the team to maintain the tempo of the first match between Nigeria and Pharoahs of Egypt.

They said that while the Eagles started on a good footing a lot of work needed to be done to ensure victory.

Mr Mahmood Aliyu a football enthusiast said there was the need for the players to keep up the spirit in their second group tie against Sudan.

Aliyu said that he had confidence in the ability of the Super Eagles to win the match considering the high spirit in the camp and good condition of players.

“The eagles had their recovery training session in Garoua ahead of Saturday’s encounter with Sudan so we are expecting good game” he said.

Another football enthusiast Mr Abbati Jahun said the Super Eagles currently top Group D with three points Sudan and Guinea Bissau have a point each while Egypt with no points at the bottom of the group.

“If the Eagles win the next game against the Falcons of Sudan and the result in the other fixture (Egypt versus Guinea-Bissau) is favorable.

“I understand that the Eagles vowed to maintain their winning momentum we are praying for that” he said.

Mr Nasiru Kobi North East Zonal Secretary Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) said Nigerians were expecting the Super Eagles to emerge victorious in the match against Sudan.

Kobi said the players need to improve on their finishing because their finishing in the last match was not fantastic.

He said that the Super Eagles should not be carried away by the last match against Egypt they should come out with full force and not underrate the Sudanese team.

“The Sudanese team is no serious threat to our progress however we need to be very careful in our defense” he said.

Mr Umar Said Chairman Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Bauchi State Council said that the match against Sudan would not be easy.

He said “with the experience of players we will count against them because the Super Eagles have quality players.

“Considering our first game with highly rated Egyptians the Eagles shouldn’t relent and underrate the Falcons of Sudan” he said.

Also Bello Ayuba a football player urged the Eagles not to loose focus in the match against Sudan and Guinea Bissau.

“The Super Eagles should take the match seriously they shouldn’t loose focus to think the next game will be easy they have to win it” he said

For his part Sabastine Emma commended the interim Coach Augustine Eguavoen over the good coordination against Egypt especially the team set up.

He said the players demonstrated great skills and determination in the opening match against Egypt and urged them to sustain the tempo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQvMjQtaG91cnMtYmVmb3JlLXR3ZWV0aW5nLWtvaGxpLWhhZC1pbmZvcm1lZC10ZWFtLXRoYXQtaGUtd2FzLXN0ZXBwaW5nLWRvd24tNzcyNDk5Mi_SAYkBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0LzI0LWhvdXJzLWJlZm9yZS10d2VldGluZy1rb2hsaS1oYWQtaW5mb3JtZWQtdGVhbS10aGF0LWhlLXdhcy1zdGVwcGluZy1kb3duLTc3MjQ5OTIvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,24 hours before tweeting Virat Kohli had informed team that he was stepping down,"Virat Kohli resigns as Test captain: Hours after India’s Test series loss against South Africa on Friday Virat Kohli had ended the post-match team meeting at the Newlands dressing room with an announcement and a request. To the surprise of those in the dressing room Kohi said that he had decided to step down as India’s Test captain. He also asked his teammates and the support staff to keep the news to themselves. Those at the meeting said the captain said “I ask a small favour please don’t share with anybody outside the dressing room”.

About 24 hours later on Saturday evening like so often in the past Kohli broke the news on social media. “Everything has to come to a halt at some stage and for me as Test captain of India it’s now.”

This marked the end of Kohli’s journey as a skipper as he had earlier relinquished T20I captaincy followed by the selectors’ decision to remove him from ODI leadership.

“It’s been 7 years of hard work toil and relentless perseverance every day to take the team in the right direction. I’ve done the job with absolute honesty and left nothing out there. Everything has to come to a halt at some stage and for me as Test Captain of India it’s now” Kohli wrote in his Twitter post.

At the post-match press conference after India’s series defeat in Cape Town on Friday Kohli looked unusually downbeat. The wind of change was blowing in Indian cricket with Rohit Sharma’s appointment as white-ball captain and his promotion to Test vice-captaincy. Before going to South Africa Kohli had taken on the BCCI openly contradicting Board president Sourav Ganguly on the captaincy issue. Later chief selector Chetan Sharma appeared before the press and corroborated Ganguly’s version. Following Ravi Shastri’s departure as the Indian team head coach Kohli also had lost his biggest backer in the dressing-room.

But unlike his statement in September last year when he spoke about giving up T20I captaincy to manage his workload Kohli’s post on Saturday didn’t touch upon any cricketing issues.

“There have been many ups and also some downs along the journey but never has there been a lack of effort or lack of belief. I have always believed in giving my 120 percent in everything I do and if I can’t do that I know it’s not the right thing to do. I have absolute clarity in my heart and I cannot be dishonest to my team” he wrote.

BCCI congratulates #TeamIndia captain @imVkohli for his admirable leadership qualities that took the Test team to unprecedented heights. He led India in 68 matches and has been the most successful captain with 40 wins. https://t.co/oRV3sgPQ2G — BCCI (@BCCI) January 15 2022

When Kohli took full-time charge of the Test team in Australia in 2014-15 after MS Dhoni’s shock decision to call it quits mid-series India were languishing seventh in the ICC rankings. From there to taking the team to No. 1 in the world rankings and staying there for five years had been a spectacular turnaround. Overhauling the fitness culture and forming a four-pronged pace attack capable of taking 20 wickets in any conditions would be his biggest legacies as India captain. The 33-year-old led India in 68 games and won 40 becoming the country’s most successful Test captain in the process. He presided over India’s first-ever Test series win in Australia and led the team to a 2-1 lead in England last summer before the fifth Test was postponed due to a Covid outbreak in the Indian camp.

Controversies followed him until his last Test as captain when South African skipper Dean Elgar’s DRS reprieve prompted Kohli to take his frustration to the stump microphone. He was criticised for his on-field behaviour but Kohli was always like that leading with passion taking the aggression to the opponents and wearing his heart on his sleeve.

As captain he fell out with Anil Kumble when the latter was the head coach. Shastri was brought back upon his insistence and together they wrote a golden chapter in Indian cricket. Little wonder then that Kohli’s post had a special mention for Shastri.

“To Ravi Bhai and the support group who were the engine behind this vehicle that moved us upwards in Test Cricket consistently you all have played a massive role in bringing this vision to life” he wrote.

Kohli offered his heartfelt thanks to Dhoni also. “Lastly a big thank you to MS Dhoni who believed in me as a Captain and found me to be an able individual who could take Indian Cricket forward.”

Test captaincy came to him almost without notice. His stepping down too was sudden. Did he keep the BCCI in the loop? A WhatsApp message to Ganguly asking if there was a conversation was left unanswered. Kohli in his statement thanked the cricket board. “I want to thank the BCCI for giving me the opportunity to lead my country for such a long period of time and more importantly to all the teammates who bought into the vision I had for the team from day one and never gave up in any situation. You guys have made this journey so memorable and beautiful.”"
MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L2NvdWxkLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWZvdXJ0aC1yb3VuZC1pb2wtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWZpbmQtaGlzLXdheS10by10aGUtc3RhcnRpbmctbGluZXVwLWluLTIwMjQtbmZs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

The SNP said it does not comment on such matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vbWNjb3JtaWNrLXJlY2FsbHMtcG9wdWxhci1mcmVuY2gtcHJvZHVjdC0xMzMwNDg1NzQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McCormick Recalls Its Popular French's Product Due To Potential Food Poisoning,"The bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) may be growing on the product.

Simply Recipes / McCormick

McCormick & Company Inc. has voluntarily recalled a batch of French's Original Crispy Fried Onions due to the potential growth of Staphylococcus aureus (Staph). The recall was initiated on March 18 and reported by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) on May 2.

The recalled products are:

720 pouches of 26.5-ounce French's Original Crispy Fried Onions

UPC: 041500959030



3456 units of six-ounce French's Original Crispy Fried Onions

UPC: 041500220208

Neither the company nor the FDA disclosed when the recalled products were sold to customers which batches were recalled and if they have a specific best-by date.

The recalled products were distributed to Arizona and Illinois. The FDA recall reports do not disclose whether the products were further distributed to stores beyond these two states or whether the recalled products were removed from store shelves.

What Is Staphylococcus Aureus?

The FDA explains that Staph is a bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning. Food contaminated with Staph may not smell or taste bad or look spoiled. Though the bacteria can be killed by cooking the toxins may still be able to cause illness.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) symptoms develop within 30 minutes to eight hours after consuming the contaminated food. Though severe illness is rare Staph food poisoning may cause nausea vomiting and stomach cramps.

What To Do If You Have the Recalled Products at Home

Check your pantry for the recalled products many of which have a long shelf-life. Do not eat any of the recalled products. You should discard them.

For Amber Roze McCormick known to many in pro wrestling DangerKid it took 30 years to reach that destination. The celebration isn’t to be compromised.

McCormick came out as a trans woman Saturday in an emotional Instagram post in which she detailed the last year that led to this moment.

“I can confidently say I’m living my best life and am growing into the best version of myself” McCormick said. “I am able to sit here and be proud of the growth I’ve managed to achieve and continue to.”

Get off the sidelines and into the game Our weekly playbook is packed with everything from locker room chatter to pressing LGBTQ sports issues. Weekender * Weekly Newsletter * Promotions and Partner Emails * Sign Up

The multi-time tag team champion explained that transitioning genders had been a goal she set for herself one year prior during a period of great personal and professional change.

McCormick who previously came out as nonbinary genderfluid in 2021 began undergoing HRT treatment last September and never looked back.

“On this day I can’t help but be moved to tears realizing that I wrote down ‘transition’ under a list of goals and thinking back to how I was feeling on this day one year ago” McCromick said. “I am not even close to where I want to be but the progress I’ve made I didn’t think was possible.”

The post came three months after the last time pro wrestling fans saw McCormick in the ring. Her final match as DangerKid (for the foreseeable future) saw her and longtime tag team partner close friend and fellow out pro wrestler Aiden Aggro clash in a 49-minute match at Maine-based Limitless Wrestling’s Jan. 20 event.

The match itself was framed as the end of the 10-year partnership between the team collectively known as MSP. She detailed how her and Aggro “spilled our hearts out to each other” and worked together to build the angle that would see their paths diverge.

That night brought an end to a furious run for MSP including tag team title reigns in Chaotic Wrestling New South Pro Wrestling and Blitzkrieg Pro Wrestling among other promotions along the east coast. The duo was also a staple of “EFFY’s Big Gay Brunch” and Pro Wrestling VIBE events that highlighted LGBTQ pro wrestlers in recent years.

McCormick explained that she needed to get out of wrestling for reasons associated with her transition and otherwise. “The mental and physical anguish that ten years of being in wrestling does to a person was too much for me with everything else I had going on” she said. “I don’t know if my days in wrestling are officially over but for now the time away has been exactly what I needed.”

Putting aside whether fans ever see her in the ring again the expressions of love confidence and affirmation that inundate McCormick’s declaration point to a higher achievement than a championship: finding happiness and comfort within one’s self.

Outsports congratulates Amber Roze McCormick for showing the power to live out and proud a second time over and continuing to show that Courage is Contagious."

One of the top sellers at McDonald’s in Japan during the colder months is its hot pies. This winter there’s more than just apple to choose from on the menu as the chain is also giving us a taste of Canada and Belgium with the Canadian Maple Custard Pie and the Belgian Chocola Pie.

▼ The Belgian pie (right) has been appearing for a limited time in winter since 2020 but this is the first time for it to step out with a Canadian companion.

We headed out to try the new desserts when they were released yesterday and picked up a cheeky serving of their new limited-edition chicken nuggets as well. So let’s get straight to the tasting starting with the Canadian Maple Custard Pie.

As the name suggests this is a custard pie that contains Canadian maple syrup which is enough information to set our mouths watering immediately. Upon opening it in two however we were able to really appreciate the true beauty of the pie with its generous slathering of maple syrup glistening enticingly in the light

The ratio of syrup to custard was much higher than expected but when we bit into it it turned out to be perfectly aligned with the entire pie which had a slight saltiness in the pastry. The casing was beautifully crispy and the vanilla custard filling was deliciously moreish. However we have to say this was a very sweet pie. While it might be too sweet for some we can imagine it would send sweet-tooths straight to sweet heaven.

▼ Next up time to try the Belgian Chocola.

Whereas the maple custard pie was super sweet this one was super rich. Again the crispy pie pastry was fantastic and the chunky chocolate filling here was faultless. This was an incredibly delicious pie and we can totally understand why it makes its return to the menu as a decadent winter sweet year after year.

After polishing off the two pies we reached for our box of nuggs that had been patiently waiting in the wings. These new Peppercorn Garlic Spicy Chicken McNuggets are said to be the first new nuggets to be released by the golden arches in Japan for three and a half years!

Opening our box of nuggets revealed them to be coated in a nicely seasoned batter. Popping one into our mouth we were surprised to find that this crunchy fried coating was so well seasoned with black pepper that it immediately awakened our taste buds even without any dipping sauce.

The taste of black pepper was clearly pronounced and utterly delicious. Adding a dollop of the included Garlic Soy Sauce Mayonnaise only made each morsel even more tasty creating a smooth creaminess and garlic hit in every bite.

▼ The garlic hit was just right so as to not overpower the peppery profile.

The spicy nuggets were actually a great way to finish off this feast of winter flavours as the spices helped to cleanse the palate from the creamy sweetness of the pies.

All these winter items will be on the menu for a limited time until early February with the pies priced at 150 yen (US$1.32) each and the spicy chicken nuggets priced at 200 yen.

Hopefully the treats will go some way towards sweetening the deal for McDonald’s customers in Japan who are currently dealing with the temporary loss of hash browns and medium and large-sized fries.

The Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl. The first Iowa Caucus was conducted.

And 15-year-old Stan Neal of Hagerstown began a career with the best-known fast-food company in the world — a career that has only now concluded.

In his 50 years with McDonald’s Neal rose from crew worker to become a franchisee who owned 25 McDonald’s restaurants in Maryland and West Virginia — including all the stores in Washington County.

Neal has opted to retire now having sold all his stores to new owners. But his loyalty to the brand is evident in the memorabilia filling his Hagerstown office.

“It’s been a good company for me” he said. “McDonald’s is a good brand. And it’s been very rewarding over the years. It’s been stressful and it’s been challenging but you know it’s been rewarding.”

Lots of teenagers get their first gig at McDonald’s or other fast-food enterprises but most move on. So what kept Neal under the golden arches?

“Back when I started back in 1972 there wasn’t a whole lot of jobs in Washington County” he said during a recent interview. “If you had a decent-paying job something that might have been a career you didn’t leave it because there wasn’t a whole lot of jobs.

“I lived up in the West End of Hagerstown. We were a very poor family. I got the opportunity to go start working at McDonald’s … and I never left. I’ve been there ever since.”

He worked his way up from the “crew” to manager then supervisor. Under the tutelage of the Levine family who owned the Hagerstown McDonald’s stores Neal eventually purchased a franchise of his own — in Altoona Pennsylvania.

He’d worked for Murray Levine for 18 years before Levine’s son Mark took over the family’s business Golden M Co.

“Back in 1990 I got the opportunity to buy my first store through a special program McDonald’s had” he said.

“Mark really helped me get to where I was at to become an operator” he said and last year Neal bought the McDonald’s stores Golden M still owned in Hagerstown.

At that point he owned all the McDonald’s stores in Washington County and in Cumberland and Frostburg. He also had three in Martinsburg West Virginia as well as stores in Shepherdstown Ranson Berkeley Springs Moorefield Romney Petersburg and Keyser West Virginia.

During his 50 years in fast-food he’s chronicled plenty of changes in the McDonald’s operations.

“It’s more demanding more hectic today” he said.

In decades past he found it easier to find employees.

“Back in the ’70s ’80s and part of the ’90s you’d get all the people you want to work for you today” he said. “Today it’s like pulling teeth trying just to get the stores operating every day.

“We were at the point that we were borrowing people from different stores just to keep the stores operating.”

Technological advances brought sweeping change to the restaurants’ operations. When he started he noted cash registers were equipped with a mechanical crank that could be used to operate them if the power went out.

“Now everything’s computerized. And in the same way equipment — more up-to-date technology.”

Kitchen timers have been replaced by programming.

The customer base has changed as well. In the past the restaurants targeted kids he said with Ronald McDonald and in-store play areas.

“We still try to get the kids’ business but we don’t do the Ronald shows and stuff like that like we used to.”

Neal in fact spent five of his years with McDonald’s running the regional Ronald McDonald program seeing to the needs of the chain’s familiar mascot.

Millennials sometimes prefer other chains Neal observed — brands that don’t necessarily specialize in burgers and fries. While McDonald’s retains loyal customers who grew up with the brand younger customers have more choices now.

“In my personal opinion if you don’t take your kids to McDonald’s they don’t grow up like we did years ago — it was a thing back then” he said.

Changing with the times has been the biggest challenge over the years Neal said. Nevertheless he said “all my stores have been very profitable.”

The rewarding part he said involves people — whether helping with the Ronald McDonald House program or helping his own employees.

“We had programs that if they got in trouble and needed money we’d lend them money interest-free; bonuses to help them and their families out” he said.

“The thing I’ll miss more than anything is the employee I had working for me because I had real good long-term employees.”

Neal and McDonald’s gave back to the communities too hosting fundraisers for schools donating to nonprofits and sponsoring Little League teams. Neal personally donates money to Clear Spring High School each year and helps pay for fireworks displays.

And if he had it to do over would he change anything?

“I can’t really say there would be anything I would do differently” he said. “You know I’d do it all over again.”

So what’s on his agenda now?

Travel and family.

Neal is a widower with four children but he has a fiancé and wants to see a little more of America. In anticipation he bought a new motor home to transport him to the West and the South. He wants to see Mt. Rushmore. Head down to Florida. Visit Tennessee.

“I’ve had several (recreational vehicles) over the years but I never got to really use ’em like I wanted to” he said.

Now he’ll have time to travel. And maybe grab his favorite meal on the McDonald’s menu — a Big Mac diet Coke and fries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL21jZG9uYWxkcy1zdG9jay1kZWxpdmVyeS1kcml2ZS10aHJvdWdoLWxveWFsdHktcHJvZ3JhbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Stock: The Fast-Food Giant Has a Secret Weapon,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/mcdonalds-stock-delivery-drive-through-loyalty-program on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL21jZG9uYWxkcy1zdG9jay1kZWxpdmVyeS1kcml2ZS10aHJvdWdoLWxveWFsdHktcHJvZ3JhbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L21jZG9uYWxkcy1sb2NhdGlvbnMtY3V0LWhvdXJzLXN0YWZmaW5nLXNob3J0YWdlc9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L21jZG9uYWxkcy1sb2NhdGlvbnMtY3V0LWhvdXJzLXN0YWZmaW5nLXNob3J0YWdlcy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's locations have cut hours by 10% due to staffing shortages: CEO,"McDonald's and its franchisees have cut operational hours in response to a lack of employees at a number of its U.S. locations because of coronavirus staffing shortages.

The Golden Arches similar to many restaurants around the country have struggled with consistent employee attendance during the COVID-19 surge brought on by the omicron variant as infections reach record levels. Restaurant industry data shows a dip in sales at the end of December.

Chris Kempczinski McDonald's Corp. CEO who assumed the role back in November 2019 says adjusting during these times is one of many priorities for the company's growth and well-being.

The pandemic hurt McDonald's flourishing breakfast business after a decline in morning commuters. It was able to bounce back after American cities allowed for drive-thru lanes to remain open. The fast-food chain's sales returned to pre-pandemic levels by March 2021.

Over the past two years the company has embraced celebrity partnerships with rappers Travis Scott and Saweetie and Korean pop group BTS. While new menu items from these partnerships only lasted for a limited time the promotions helped to boost sales past pre-pandemic levels.

As far as the safety of employees McDonald's has provided COVID tests McDonald's franchises for employees but has no way to track whether someone has contracted the virus or not. Kempczinki says that should be the responsibility of a healthcare agency.

McDonald's and its franchises employ close to 800000 people in the U.S.

The Supreme Court said no to the mandate earlier this week.

In a time where 2021 was dubbed The Great Resignation due to a record-breaking year for Americans who quit their jobs McDonald's works to pivot and make the necessary adjustments. As of now Chris Kempczinki says he'll continue to plan for the future of the company but doesn't bank on longevity as leader of the company.

""I’d say I’m a little bit more Zen about just everything that goes into the job"" he says.

Medtech giant Medtronic took more than three years to replace and start recalling insulin pumps with defective retainer rings after first becoming aware of the problem according to an FDA warning letter sent to the company in December and recently made public.

The company also failed to investigate more than 800 complaints about defective updated retainer rings from diabetes patients who were using the product. It also failed to promptly notify the FDA within 30 days after discovering that issues with the device could lead to serious injury or death.

""In summary your corrective actions are still in process and you have not yet conducted effectiveness checks to ensure the updated procedures and required employee training will prevent reoccurrence of the identified deficiencies"" the FDA said in the letter.

The company did not dispute any details in the FDA's warning letter but made the case that it is making necessary improvements in its diabetes business.

""We take these issues very seriously and hold ourselves to the highest standards of quality and patient safety"" said Pamela Reese a spokeswoman for Medtronic. ""We are addressing the observations noted in the warning letter while also working to strengthen our broader quality systems and processes.""

While FDA warning letters are relatively common one expert said the recent one to Medtronic raises very serious concerns.

""In looking through this letter I think this is on the very high level of serious severe violations by Medtronic"" said Dr. Michael Carome director of the health research group for the Washington D.C.-based Public Citizen a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.

""The violations as described would have put patients at risk for potential serious harm"" Carome said. ""The violations are very serious and what makes them the most concerning is a pattern that spans years and multiple violations over that period.""

The FDA letter detailed that Medtronic started an internal investigation in June 2016 as it was receiving more complaints about clear retainer rings breaking in its MiniMed 600 series insulin pumps. A plan to alert customers to the issue in 2016 was scrapped.

Medtronic did not introduce redesigned pumps with black retainer rings until August 2019 and did not begin notifying customers of retainer ring failures until November 2019 when it announced a recall.

The FDA letter adds that Medtronic did not adequately assess the serious risk to patients of the medical device failures.

According to its letter: ""FDA determined that there was a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to the pumps manufactured with the clear retainer ring would cause serious adverse health consequences including severe hypoglycemia which can result in loss of consciousness seizure; severe hyperglycemia ... or death.""

The FDA also noted that during the company's original recall of its MiniMed 600 series pumps it told customers who didn't notice any damage could keep using the original pumps. The FDA's letter noted ""after redesigning the retainer ring to prevent further risk you failed to adequately remove the pumps containing the older less robust ring from the market.""

In an updated recall in October the company announced that any insulin pump with a clear retainer ring could be returned and replaced with a pump that has the updated black retainer ring at no charge. A total of 463464 MiniMed devices have been recalled.

In a letter to customers at the time Medtronic said: ""Serious injuries and deaths have been reported with the use of the MiniMed 600 series insulin pumps but have not been directly correlated with damaged clear retainer rings based on information available to Medtronic and review with independent clinical experts.""

The FDA issued the letter to Medtronic on Dec. 9 the company disclosed receiving it on Dec. 15 providing a general overview. The detailed letter became public on the FDA's website after Dec. 28.

The FDA inspected Medtronic's facility in Northridge Calif. — the headquarters of Medtronic's diabetes business — from June 7 through July 7 last summer. The FDA's letter indicates that Medtronic sent five responses to the agency's findings from July 28 through Dec. 3.

The FDA's warning letter also indicates that Medtronic did not investigate more than 800 complaints about defective black retainer rings largely because it claimed that the issue was being addressed by a previous investigation of clear retainer rings. The company now acknowledges it should not have done so.

Meanwhile a law firm in Toronto has launched a proposed class action lawsuit for Canadian users of MiniMed600 series of insulin pumps. The claim filed in October seeks $225 million Canadian dollars in damages. The action is specifically for Canadian users of the insulin pumps. Under Ontario law affected family members can also claim damages.

Reese the company's spokeswoman said the lawsuit ""is at a very early stage and the company will defend against the claims vigorously. Medtronic believes its actions regarding these devices have been appropriate.""

The company's diabetes division changed leadership amid the insulin pump issues. Medtronic veteran Sean Salmon was tapped in October 2019 to lead the diabetes business.

""Since joining the Diabetes Operating Unit Sean Salmon has been actively working to strengthen the business including the quality systems and overall approach to quality management. This began with the initiation of the Class 1 recall of the retainer ring in 2019"" Reese said.

In December 2020 Salmon added a second post president of the cardiovascular portfolio while retaining his leadership role in the diabetes business.

In a statement at the time Medtronic CEO Geoff Martha said ""I am confident in his ability to continue the turnaround of our diabetes business.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5c21lZGljYWxkZXZlbG9wbWVudHMuY29tL25ld3MvbWVkdHJvbmljLWFmZmVyYS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1jYXJkaWFjLWFibGF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medtronic acquires Affera,,,,,,,,,,

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."
META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvY2lhbG1lZGlhdG9kYXkuY29tL25ld3MvbWV0YXMtZGV2ZWxvcGluZy1hbmQtZXRoaWNhbC1mcmFtZXdvcmstZm9yLXRoZS11c2Utb2YtdmlydHVhbC1pbmZsdWVuY2VyLzYxNzIzOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta Is Developing an 'Ethical Framework' for the Use of Virtual Influencers,"With the rise of digital avatars and indeed fully digital characters that have evolved into genuine social media influencers in their own right online platforms now have an obligation to establish clear markers as to what’s real and what’s not and how such creations can be used in their apps.

The coming metaverse shift will further complicate this with the rise of virtual depictions blurring the lines of what will be allowed in terms of representation. But with many virtual influencers already operating Meta is now working to establish ethical boundaries on their application.

As explained by Meta:

“From synthesized versions of real people to wholly invented “virtual influencers” (VIs) synthetic media is a rising phenomenon. Meta platforms are home to more than 200 VIs with 30 verified VI accounts hosted on Instagram. These VIs boast huge follower counts collaborate with some of the world’s biggest brands fundraise for organizations like the WHO and champion social causes like Black Lives Matter.”

Some of the more well-known examples on this front are Shudu who has more than 200k followers on Instagram and Lil’ Miquela who has an audience of over 3 million in the app.

At first glance you wouldn’t necessarily realize that this is not an actual person which makes such characters a great vehicle for brand and product promotions as they can be utilized 24/7 and can be placed into any environment. But that also leads to concerns about body image perception deepfakes and other forms of misuse through false or unclear representation.

Deepfakes in particular may be problematic with Meta citing this campaign with English football star David Beckham as an example of how new technologies are evolving to expand the use of language as one element for varying purpose.

The well-known ‘DeepTomCruise’ account on TikTok is another example of just how far these technologies have come and it’s not hard to imagine a scenario where they could be used to say show a politician saying or doing something that he or she actually didn’t which could have significant real world impacts.

Which is why Meta is working with developers and experts to establish clearer boundaries on such use – because while there is potential for harm there are also beneficial uses for such depictions.

“Imagine personalized video messages that address individual followers by name. Or celebrity brand ambassadors appearing as salespeople at local car dealerships. A famous athlete would make a great tutor for a kid who loves sports but hates algebra.”

Such use cases will increasingly become the norm as VR and AR technologies are developed with these platforms placing digital characters front and center and establishing new norms for digital connection.

It would be better to know what’s real and what’s not and as such Meta needs clear regulations to remove dishonest depictions and enforce transparency over VI use.

But then again much of what you see on Instagram these days is not real with filters and editing tools altering people’s appearance well beyond what’s normal or realistic. That can also have damaging consequences and while Meta’s looking to implement rules on VI use there’s arguably a case for similar transparency in editing tools applied to posted videos and images as well.

That’s a more complex element particularly as such tools also enable people to feel more comfortable in posting which no doubt increases their in-app activity. Would Meta be willing to put more focus on this element if it could risk impacting user engagement? The data on the impact of Instagram on people’s mental health are pretty clear with comparison being a key concern.

Should that also come under the same umbrella of increased digital transparency?

It’s seemingly not included in the initial framework as yet but at some stage this is another element that should be examined especially given the harmful effects that social media usage can have on young women.

But however you look at it this is no doubt a rising element of concern and it’s important for Meta to build guardrails and rules around the use of virtual influencers in their apps.

Honestly it makes perfect sense online merchants and platforms such as Facebook Marketplace account for both a lot of money on the platform and provide a lot of the user interaction that makes social media platforms flourish. Meta’s also been exploring newer and newer avenues in order to improve e-commerce on the platform. Facebook’s been looking into integrating AR technology with online purchases allowing users to try products on before purchasing them. Instagram’s added in multiple purchasing features such as linking products in pictures or allowing creators on the platform to sell their own merchandise and branded content. WhatsApp’s built entire features for business accounts allowing startups to more easily engage in customer service. Of all the features and add-ons that Meta keeps experimenting with which have been a lot e-commerce is something that’s doing very well for itself across all social media platforms that it owns.The policies that Meta has set aside for sellers on the platform are generally defined under the umbrella term of Commerce Policies. These pertain to all sales that fall under Meta's different outlets i.e. Marketplace WhatsApp Shops and Product Catalogues. Furthermore the infographic specifies that other sets of policies may also apply to sellers operating on such platforms. Commercial Terms for example apply to all examples of these platforms being used for marketing or business purposes. Merchant Agreements to sellers setting up shop in Marketplace or by using Commerce Manager. Advertising Policies apply to any and all ads that are sold on Meta's platforms and should be familiarized with by more than just sellers.Read next: Meta’s NPE Team Has Managed To Shut Down Yet Another App Adding Far Too Many Gravestone In Far Too Little Time,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHktam91cm5hbC5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9lbnRlci10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Enter the Metaverse,"It is no coincidence that the metaverse as a practical project emerged out of the experience of the Covid-19 pandemic. The concept is older tracing its origins to such science fiction classics as Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash but the last two years have transformed it into an actual business proposition capable of dictating a name change for Facebook (now Meta) and moving billions of dollars in capital markets.

The great migration to digital during the pandemic showed the enormous advantages of being able to work and live within an artificial secondary universe. In this universe the laws of space and time no longer apply or at least they can be bent enhancing human powers in ways still to explore: an end to long commutes and the achievement of measurable increases in productivity; the ability to participate in meetings and conferences on different continents and on the same day; and children still able to attend school even amid the worst public-health emergency in a century.

Unfortunately the limits of digital experience were no less apparent. A lot gets lost when human interaction takes place on a screen. The results of remote schooling have so far proved mixed at best. A digital work environment soon revealed itself as considerably more exhausting than the real counterpart. Human beings are built for the kind of immersive interaction that takes place in the physical world where all five senses get involved. Some of our mental abilities including memory suffer markedly when we are reduced to disembodied egos on Zoom. As for entertainment digital experiences are still so far from the actual fun of going to a restaurant or a music concert that nothing one tried on the Internet during the lockdowns measured up.

The immediate appeal of the metaverse is that it promises to marshal the virtues of digital life while addressing many of its shortcomings. Instead of business meetings on Zoom imagine entering a digital room and talking to our colleagues around a virtual table or even walking together in an electronically conjured garden. I imagine the metaverse as a virtual world with some of the characteristics of a city. There will be virtual malls where users can move from store to store and buy the products that will later be delivered to their physical homes—a big improvement in digital shopping over the flat webpage. There will be virtual beaches where we can meet our friends to chat and play much like what Fortnite already offers today only much better. There will be concerts and art galleries. Is there a reason to travel physically to Venice to visit the Biennale instead of jumping into the metaverse and enjoying all the art and video installations with the latest fully immersive technology? Traveling to exotic locations could happen while we sit in our own living room. It’s easy to imagine the growth of a new digital economy where creators will be less dependent on mediators of all kinds. Barriers to entry will likely be lower and audiences potentially much larger than in the real world.

The metaverse has to be highly concurrent: this artificial world has to be continuously updated from the inputs of its millions or potentially billions of users. The only way a virtual experience can rival the real thing is if it acquires the same flux and complexity. It’s not enough to encounter a prepackaged version of reality. One wants to travel to a virtual Biennale in order to see what others are preparing for us in real time; ideally too one wants to arrive with thousands of other people with whom it would be possible to interact and with whom one could share the event. It should be possible to acquire some of the artworks in both physical and virtual formats. Virtual objects once acquired must be preserved within the metaverse. One should be able to carry them to other digital spaces without sacrificing their virtual authenticity in a world where “virtual authenticity” is not a contradiction in terms.

Return to the virtual malls above. Users visit a virtual car dealership where they can buy a model to be delivered to their physical homes. They will want to test the car virtually and they may also be interested in buying a virtual twin to drive in the metaverse. The virtual and physical worlds might become increasingly integrated.

An immersive three-dimensional environment expresses the vision of a metaverse more fully and more naturally than other interfaces but it isn’t the innovation’s most important feature. What truly distinguishes the metaverse is its autonomy from the physical world. The metaverse exists on its own. It has a life of its own. It creates a genuinely alternative world. As Mark Zuckerberg does not tire of pointing out the metaverse cannot be compared with the Internet because it aims to place us within the digital experience inside an embodied Internet on a more or less unending basis. One accesses the Internet. One enters the metaverse.

The difference matters. To see why consider how the relation between user and the digital environment gets turned on its head. With the Internet the user remains sovereign dictating when and how digital interactions take place. In the metaverse the user finds himself entirely surrounded by the platform and the quality of the experiences will frequently depend on whether he or she accepts that fact.

Zuckerberg notes that nothing will prevent us from using non-virtual technologies to enter the metaverse at least in part. There are obvious practical limits to the deployment of virtual-reality headsets for example. If your metaverse avatar is scheduled to attend a musical concert but you happen to be riding the subway in the physical world at the time it should be possible just to listen to the concert on an app in your phone using regular headphones.

But the metaverse needs to be fully persistent and continuous. If the ambition of the metaverse is to constitute an artificial world capable in time of rivaling the real one experiences there must acquire meaning with reference to other experiences in the metaverse not just those taking place in the real world. And this means that the metaverse should never really disappear even when a user momentarily withdraws into real life. The metaverse must persist or perdure.

This is not to say that 3-D technology will not be a significant element of the metaverse. Once it is established that the metaverse aims to create a persistent and continuous environment it makes sense to develop that environment in ways that make it genuinely capable of rivaling the physical world. Three-dimensional technology is a part of that as are payment services games currencies and networks.

Aspects of the metaverse have been around for a while already. How to interpret the advent of social media if not as the first stage of the metaverse? Consider Twitter. It has some of the characteristics of an artificial world starting with high density and including persistence and continuity helping to explain its extraordinary success. Technically Twitter is rather primitive a predominantly verbal medium of low bandwidth. From a conceptual perspective however it has been a revolution: a new world that users enter rather than contemplate and that continues to exist and develop in their absence. Log out go to sleep and when you wake up all kinds of developments responses and interactions will have occurred.

I am reminded of the story of a New York executive who posted an ill-considered tweet right before boarding a flight to South Africa a few years ago. While she was flying presumably without Internet service the tweet was retweeted thousands and thousands of times every hour; she was fired from her job lost all her friends and saw her life collapse like a house of cards. She had disconnected from Twitter but the beast kept growing and moving even in her absence. What makes Twitter addictive is its actual resemblance to the physical world in the power of its autonomous operations while being relatively free of many of its constraints.

The simplicity of Twitter’s artificial world has created difficulties for its revenue model—there is only so much one can do to monetize it. Imagine now a Twitter that you could enter in virtual reality with advertising hanging on the walls of a virtual room where messages are exchanged. One can think of a metaverse version of Twitter that features virtual stadiums where your social media followers will congregate to hear your speeches or where you could launch your own entertainment programs.

Many current social developments are early manifestations of what the metaverse will likely bring. As social media laid down the initial infrastructure for alternative realities we witness how conspiracies of all kinds and other social games start to erupt. Many can be better understood as analogues of video games elaborate programs where participants take on different roles or avatars and must follow complex rules determining how the game should be played and how to perform the tasks for which social points may be awarded. As the metaverse expands phenomena of wholesale dissociation from reality are bound to multiply. We may soon face a choice between building a rich metaverse and improving the real world just as reality faces new crises ranging from pandemics to climate change. Even economic growth may eventually bifurcate between two concepts one valid in the metaverse and the other in physical reality.

One day the Internet arrived seemingly from nowhere and we got used to thinking that it would be forever. It now seems clear that we are on the cusp of a successor: the metaverse. Much has been written about a clash of titans between Facebook and Microsoft to decide which will control the new virtual world to which humanity as a whole is supposed to migrate. Usually though market forces follow state forces: Is there a geopolitical race for the metaverse?

One of China’s main think tanks recently published a report on the implications of the metaverse for national security—perhaps the first such reflection. The main conclusion is not that we shall soon be fighting wars in the metaverse but something much more plausible and relevant. The report sees three immediate impacts of the metaverse. First it will be a driver for technological innovation and in some cases in areas adjacent to military interests: simulation graphics artificial intelligence wearables robot technology and brain-computer interface. The second will be to move the digital ecosystem and the digital economy to new technological platforms—e-commerce will no longer take place on current platforms for instance. Third the metaverse will start to integrate the needs of the virtual and physical worlds as we saw above realizing an old ambition of the Internet age.

The report anticipates that the metaverse could have deep consequences for the global distribution of power. It “will trigger a new round of reshuffling” in the global technological order. Some companies and countries will lose out; others might have an opportunity to rise. That happened already with the Internet economy when Europe could not help falling behind the United States and China was able to resist the imperium of the large American platforms only from a purely defensive posture.

According to the Chinese think tank American authorities may hope to use the metaverse revolution to push U.S. companies to a new and unassailable position of global dominance while taking advantage of the new technology to promote American culture and American values globally. That Meta has taken the lead is seen as particularly ominous.

It is easy to see why many might regard the concept of the metaverse as excessively influenced by Western ideas. The metaverse is before everything else a method of escapism. Each individual gains the freedom to pursue his or her own most personal fantasies in the metaverse. It is as if the common world fragmented into millions or billions of private universes. Science fiction writer Liu Cixin argues that the metaverse is like a drug—one so powerful as to break our connection with the world around us. As he put it humanity is now at a fork in the road: in one direction lies the exploration of outer space; the other leads inward toward virtual reality the “dead end of entertainment.”

How could the Chinese Communist Party not regard the project as a threat? The historical mission of a revolutionary party is to call the masses to a common project and to transform the physical world as needed to satisfy this objective—not to encourage an escape to an artificial universe. Renowned blockchain expert Yu Jianing author of a new book in China called Metaverse has insisted that the metaverse must never become a virtual economy but only a tool “empowering the real economy.”

I do see one way to reconcile the metaverse with CCP interests. Rather than using the metaverse to invent purely imaginary worlds it would be possible to use it to create altered versions of the real world. In this sense the Chinese Internet is already a kind of metaverse a virtual-reality machine giving us a vision of the world from which certain elements have been excised.

The concept reminds me of phenomena I have written about in a different context: China’s vast global Belt and Road infrastructure-and-investment initiative. Even in its formative stage the Belt and Road is an exercise in the opacity of power. There is an exoteric doctrine of the initiative—and then an esoteric practice where deals are agreed upon often with no written evidence and where hierarchy resembles that of security-clearance levels of access. Some participants know only the broadest strokes of the plan sufficient to defend it and to communicate with lower levels. Others know nothing. Only a few can see months or years in advance. The metaverse would offer a range of similar possibilities to the Chinese regime. By forging different levels of virtual reality it could establish different levels of access for different groups while ensuring a much tighter grip on how access is distributed.

The metaverse represents the most recent battle between human freedom and the constraints of reality. It could also become a battle to define reality itself.

From sneakers sketched in the virtual world and produced in the real one to designers who preview clothes on avatars before making them the barrier between digital and tangible is blurring.

Online platforms that are precursors of the metaverse vision for the internet’s future are already serving as workrooms to develop products destined for sale in real life.

Online is “a place of openness to test things virtually and recreate an extremely precise connection with the real-life experience” he added.

The clamour over virtual goods comes amid feverish predictions that the metaverse – a virtual reality version of the internet – will eventually replace the web of today.

In recent months a growing number of brands have been trying to establish a presence on buzzed-about platforms from Roblox to Fortnite for fear of missing out on a major tech and societal shift.

How users interact with online goods – what they flock to and what they ignore – offers a relatively low-risk and low-cost opportunity for firms to develop products.

This is part of an underlying trend of exploiting data collected online “to develop better collections to do better forecasting” said Achim Berg partner at management consultant McKinsey.

The coronavirus pandemic has helped shrink the distance between virtual and real by pushing many designers to create online being unable to meet physically the consultant added.

RTFKT studio and Seattle artist FEWOCiOUS created 621 pairs of virtual sneakers matching each digital pair sold with real-life shoes for customers to pick up six weeks afterwards.

At the end of February 2021 RTFKT studio together with Seattle artist FEWOCiOUS launched a limited edition of 621 pairs of virtual sneakers. One aspect of the operation was to match each digital pair sold that day with tangible shoes which each buyer could pick up six weeks later.

“We think that emotional bond to physical objects is still important and can increase the attachment” to digital products Benoit Pagotto one of the founders of RTFKT which was acquired by Nike in December said.

The Aglet app which mixes virtual sneakers and augmented reality has created its Telga shoes similarly to heavyweights Adidas or Reebok.

Now it plans to make real sneakers said the company’s CEO Ryan David Mullins who said the first batch of 500 had already been sold before production even began.

“Once you can quantify the demand within these platforms it makes it much easier to build the channel into the physical world to manufacture them” he said.

Aglet is starting to work with younger designers for whom the cost of entry to building their own physical brand can be too much. “But starting to design it virtually is much easier” Mullins said.

Another variation of the growth online is the high-end fashion platform Farfetch which in August launched a formula that allows people to pre-order Balenciaga Off-White or Dolce & Gabbana items that are only digital.

The site has collaborated with the studio DressX which designs virtual clothes to achieve a rendering that is as convincing as possible.

The pieces are manufactured in the workshop according to the pre-orders a set-up that is more attractive for high-end brands than for ready-to-wear behemoths.

This can also help avoid overproduction and unsold goods which have become an environmental concern.

Not all however are convinced by the vision of turning the digital into reality. “Digital pieces can be worn collected and traded in the metaverse so there’s no need for physical counterparts” said The Fabricant a virtual fashion house.

The Dutch company still sees the permeability between the two worlds as a good thing when people choose “to bring the aesthetic of the virtual world into their physical lives.”

“In the end it’s about desirability” said Berg. “If it is desirable in that (virtual) space why wouldn’t it be desirable in another space?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMTYvd2FsbWFydC1pcy1xdWlldGx5LXByZXBhcmluZy10by1lbnRlci10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLmh0bWzSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wMS8xNi93YWxtYXJ0LWlzLXF1aWV0bHktcHJlcGFyaW5nLXRvLWVudGVyLXRoZS1tZXRhdmVyc2UuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart is quietly preparing to enter the metaverse,"In this article WMT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

Walmart appears to be venturing into the metaverse with plans to create its own cryptocurrency and collection of non-fungible tokens or NFTs. The big-box retailer filed several new trademarks late last month that indicate its intent to make and sell virtual goods including electronics home decorations toys sporting goods and personal care products. In a separate filing Walmart said it would offer users a virtual currency as well as NFTs. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Walmart filed the applications on Dec. 30.

In total seven separate applications have been submitted. In a statement Walmart said it is ""continuously exploring how emerging technologies may shape future shopping experiences."" It declined to comment on the specific trademark filings. ""We are testing new ideas all the time"" the company added. ""Some ideas become products or services that make it to customers. And some we test iterate and learn from.""

""[The filings are] super intense"" said Josh Gerben a trademark attorney. ""There's a lot of language in these which shows that there's a lot of planning going on behind the scenes about how they're going to address cryptocurrency how they're going to address the metaverse and the virtual world that appears to be coming or that's already here."" Gerben said that ever since Facebook announced it was changing its company name to Meta signaling its ambitions beyond social media businesses have been rushing to figure out how they will fit into a virtual world.

Twice Super Bowl champion Eli Manning is an expert at silencing critics from gridiron to the stands of his third-grade daughter’s basketball game.

The mild-mannered four-time Pro Bowler defined an era of New York Giants football cutting a contrast to the National Football League’s big personalities before retiring in January 2020 with a long list of franchise records.

Today the quarterback turned girls’ basketball coach is letting his hair down enjoying the relative anonymity afforded by a face mask and stands empty of critical parents.

“You don’t have the parents yelling at you because their kid’s not playing enough” Manning 41 told Reuters. “I was like ‘No I don’t do emails. I don’t accept any criticism. Like we’re going out there. We’re playing.’”

It is the kind of flair that even his avid fans might not have seen in his playing days during which he pulled off one of the greatest upsets in professional sport to beat Tom Brady’s undefeated New England Patriots at the Super Bowl in 2008.

“I didn’t want my fans to think I did anything else besides football” said Manning. “I just wanted them to think that’s all I did … And to some degree it was a little true.”

Two years after retirement he has all but shed that mindset singing along to Olivia Rodrigo’s Gen Z anthem “good 4 u” in a raucous post-season ad campaign for Frito-Lay and PepsiCo with other larger-than-life NFL figures including Terry Bradshaw and enjoying the popularity of the “ManningCast” show he launched last year on ESPN2 with his brother Peyton.

“I definitely had a different side of me that my team mates knew” he said. “They kind of saw me get to relax or I could let my hair down a little bit.

“And so yeah I think now it’s kind of all that - I don’t have to hide something… you’re just kind of a little bit more relaxed and willing to kind of put yourself out there a little bit more.”

Manning predicts more success for MVP candidate Aaron Rodgers this post-season with the quarterback’s Green Bay Packers getting a week’s rest courtesy of a first-round bye.

“I just don’t know who’s going to go into Green Bay and beat them at home” said Manning who sees the Tennessee Titans taking the AFC.

“I feel like even though they (Packers) are the number one seed they’re still an underdog. No one’s really giving them a chance and I think they like that” said Manning.

“They’re not blowing guys out but they find ways to win. And I think just having that quality is a great thing to have in the playoffs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjYxOTgwL21ldGxpZmUtYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC1sYXVuY2hlcy1tb2JpbGUtYXBwLXRvLWhlbHDSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5kaGFrYXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL2FtcC9idXNpbmVzcy8yNjE5ODAvbWV0bGlmZS1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLWxhdW5jaGVzLW1vYmlsZS1hcHAtdG8taGVscA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MetLife Bangladesh launches mobile app to help people manage serious illnesses,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/261980/metlife-bangladesh-launches-mobile-app-to-help on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjYxOTgwL21ldGxpZmUtYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC1sYXVuY2hlcy1tb2JpbGUtYXBwLXRvLWhlbHDSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5kaGFrYXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL2FtcC9idXNpbmVzcy8yNjE5ODAvbWV0bGlmZS1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLWxhdW5jaGVzLW1vYmlsZS1hcHAtdG8taGVscA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzE1L2FudG9uaW8tYnJvd24tY2hhbmdlcy10dW5lLW9uLXRvbS1icmFkeS10cnVlLWZyaWVuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Antonio Brown changes tune on Tom Brady: 'True friend',"Antonio Brown has reversed field on his recent jabs directed at Tom Brady.

After saying last week that his former Patriots and Buccaneers quarterback was only his friend because “I’m a good football player” and “he needs me to play football” Brown said Friday that he has since spoken with Brady and indicated their relationship is fine.

“Listen I love Tom. That’s my guy. Don’t get it twisted” Brown 33 told TMZ Sports outside a Beverly Hills restaurant. “A lot of words were taken out of substance.

“Tom is one of my true friends in the midst of adversity that was there for me so don’t get it twisted about nothing with Tom Brady. He’s a GOAT. Great player. Great teammate. Don’t let my distractions or what’s going on with me take away from that.”

Brown who was released by the Buccaneers after stripping off his jersey and leaving the field at MetLife Stadium against the Jets on Jan. 2 added that he clarified with Brady the comments he made about the seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback on the “Full Send Podcast” on Jan. 7.

Asked by TMZ if he’d root for Brady and the Buccaneers in their playoff game Sunday against the Eagles Brown replied “of course” and said he’s “rooting for the best team.”

The seven-time Pro Bowl receiver also revealed that he’ll need offseason surgery “soon” on the ankle injury he has claimed was at the root of his sideline disagreement with Tampa Bay coach Bruce Arians.

When asked if he hopes to continue his NFL career in 2022 and what he’d say to possible interested but hesitant teams Brown answered “Of course. I’d say once I get healthy I’ll be ready to go.”

“Obviously I could have handled my emotions better.” he added “but sometimes under anger you might not handle yourself the right way.”

As at January 7 global companies raised more than $100 billion worth of bonds as financiers worked in an effort to lock in the low borrowing costs before the expected rise in benchmark interest rates.

While the early-January rush is traditional this amount of new deals may by an early indicator of the issuances expected early this year. Banks and other financial issuers dominated the deals with a number of foreign institutions raising funds in the US markets.

New bonds have been issued by blue-chip names such as MetLife (life insurance company) and Caterpillar as well as pandemic-hit companies such as cruise operator Royal Caribbean. Having said this there are indications that investors may have pulled back on some orders for new bonds after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s (‘Fed’) December meeting were issued last week.

In one of my articles back in October 2021 it was indicated that central bankers insisted that the surging inflation was purely transitory or temporary. However the December meetings held by the Fed the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) suggested that central bankers are worrying that this period of high inflation has become ‘persistent’.

This worry saw the ECB and the Fed sharply scale back their bond-buying programmes and there seems to be a clear shift across the global economy towards a more hawkish outlook on inflation.

While countries like the UK and Norway already raised interest rates to 0.25 per cent (from 0.1 per cent) and to 0.5 per cent (from 0.25 per cent) respectively rising inflation and a tightening job market may indicate that the Fed might also follow this path. In fact in a note published last week Goldman Sachs’ chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote that they expect “to see hikes in March June and September and have now added a hike in December for a total of four in 2022”.

In 2022 we are expecting new bonds to be issued on the local stock market - Noelle Micallef

On the other hand back in November ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the ECB is very unlikely to raise interest rates in 2022 as inflation remains too low. Further confirming this point Governing Council member Klaas Knot indicated that the ECB will be ready for an interest rate hike in early 2023 after ending the remaining bond purchases by the end of 2022.

In 2021 we also saw a number of local companies benefit from persistently-low interest rates. While 2020 was clouded with volatility and uncertainty brought about by the pandemic the vaccine roll-out and the economic recovery led to €242 million worth of corporate bonds being issued on the local stock exchange in 2021.

Meanwhile in 2022 we are expecting new bonds to be issued on the local stock market with the bonds already announced by Gap Group plc and AX Real Estate plc to commence trading in the coming weeks. While we are still far from 2016’s record high of just under €400 million new corporate bonds issued on the Malta Stock Exchange we do expect local companies to take advantage of the current interest rate market.

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is still uncertain for the upcoming year officials in charge of monetary policy downgraded the importance they attached to the coronavirus and its effects on economic activity.

The Fed ECB and the BoE have all highlighted the uncertainty brought about by the Omicron variant although none of them have indicated that it will be pivotal to policy in the coming months. But now it seems that the tightening cycle has begun and if these inflation rates continue to persist central banks will have to face bigger challenges in the near future.

With the fuss that Hrgovic’s promoter Kalle Sauerland has made about 43-year-old Luis Ortiz and Joseph Parker rejecting a fight against him it may have given him the false belief that he’s better than he is.

If Hrgovic loses this fight against Yoka it could upend his pro career before it’s ever gotten a chance to get started. There are more accessible routes to a title shot for Hrgovic than going through Yoka and it would be wise for his promoters to consider them before he suffers his first loss.

Hrgovic is a good fighter but he was exposed repeatedly by Yoka during his amateur days and shown to be robotic slow and one-dimensional.

Yoka to face the Boogeyman

“Filip Hrgovic has an opponent in that IBF eliminator against Tony Yoka'” said Chris Mannix on Boxing. “They’re engaged in negotiations. In the last six months we’ve had Michael Hunter turn down the chance to fight Filip Hrgovic.

“Hrgovic in our fighter meeting a couple of weeks back called Hunter a coward. He was pretty strong on that one.

“Recently it’s been Luis Ortiz who quickly declined to enter negotiations there [with Hrgovic] and it was Joseph Parker who declined [next].

“There were plenty of reasons why these guys won’t fight Hrgovic especially the last two because Ortiz and Parker can probably get something economically viable in the next six months before Hrgovic is.

“Does this surprise you that we’re going down the list in an IBF title eliminator and we stop at Tony Yoka who has done nothing to warrant an IBF eliminator opportunity?” said Mannix.

“It doesn’t because Filip Hrgovic is a high-risk low-reward type of proposition right?” said Keith Idec. “Luis Ortiz is not going to fight Filip Hrgovic. That makes no sense right?

“I mean he [Ortiz] could get closer to a world title shot but he was knocked down twice by Charles Martin [on January 1st]. Obviously he came back and landed a big shot [in the sixth] to win the fight.

“But he’s showing signs of whatever age he actually is. He’s not going to fight Hrgovic and I don’t blame Joseph Parker either [for not agreeing to fight Hrgovic].

“Joseph Parker has been in a lot of tough fights and wants to get back in position to fight for a title. Now he has to go through this guy? I don’t blame him. I wouldn’t do it either.”

Hrgovic’s so-called reputation for being the boogeyman in the heavyweight division was built on his wins over fluff opposition which is why the fans could be in for a surprise when they see him get beaten by Yoka.

Filip Hrgovic’s best wins as a pro:

Eric Molina – 39-years-old

Rydell Booker – 40-years-old

Kevin Johnson – 42-years-old

Amir Mansour – 49-years-old

Gregory Corbin

Mario Heredia

Sean Turner

Tom Little

Raphael Zumbano

If you know anything about boxing you’ll recognize that Hrgovic’s opposition as a professional has been atrocious from start to finish making it difficult to understand how he developed a reputation as a boogeyman.

To be a boogeyman in a weight class you must fight quality opposition and this writer fails to see one fighter that fits that description on Hrgovic’s five-year pro resume.

Hrgovic & Yoka have history

“There is some history. I think you have 11 and 14 fights respectively Hrgovic and Yoka” said Idec. “So there’s history between them. They fought three times in the amateurs. Yoka beat him and you were ringside for the semifinals of the super heavyweight tournament in 2016 in Rio [Olympics].

“So there’s a lot of history there and it’s an interesting fight. I give Tony Yoka a lot of credit because I’ve seen a lot more from Hrgovic as a pro than I have of Tony Yoka.

“So he would seem to me to be more prepared for the fight. So it speaks to Yoka’s confidence that he’s willing to take this kind of fight in what would be his twelfth fight.

“So there’s some intrigue there. You’d rather see this fight a little further down the line but kudos to both guys for being willing to do it. They have to come to an agreement.

“He’s [Yoka] only agreed to today so far is to enter negotiations so they have to get this deal done and everything. But if the money is there there’s no reason why they can’t fight.

CONFIRMED: @TonyYoka has formally accepted tonight in writing the challenge to fight @Filip_Hrgovic in a final IBF Final Eliminator for the Heavyweight World Championship – El Animal has found a dance partner 🔥 pic.twitter.com/LB0datFo4H — Kalle & Nisse Sauerland (@SauerlandBros) January 13 2022

“It’s an interesting fight between two very good young heavyweights. Joseph Parker can go fight someone else to try and edge closer to a world title shot and the same for Luis Ortiz” said Idec.

If Hrgovic doesn’t improve since the three previous times he fought Yoka in the amateur ranks he’s going to lose again. Hrgovic is an excellent fighter but he struggles against boxers with skills and Yoka is gifted.

It might be better for Hrgovic to go in another direction for a world title shot rather than face his old nemesis Yoka.

If Hrgovic loses this fight it could take him many years to come back from the defeat and he’s not young at 29.

Hrgovic’s promoters have brought him along too slowly resulting in him wasting the first five years of his pro career fighting lesser opposition exclusively and zero contenders.

Assuming Hrgovic loses to Yoka it could be another five years before he’s back to where he is now fighting in an eliminator. By that time Hrgovic will be 34 and likely not the fighter he is today.

Yoka-Hrgovic winner will need to wait

“One thing to remember in the grand scheme of eliminators. The winner of this fight [Yoka vs. Hrgovic] is not going to get a world title shot this year I would imagine” said Mannix.

“The IBF is way down in the queue for mandatories and you’re probably going to see a unification fight between Fury and the winner of Joshua and Usyk before the end of the year.

“So it’s not like you get this opportunity and bam heavyweight title shot coming this summer. You’re probably going to have to wait your turn for a while and take another fight or two fights in between” said Mannix.

Under a best-case scenario the Yoka vs. Hrgovic fight winner will need to wait until 2023 before they get a title shot for the IBF belt. When that time comes it’s possible that Tyson Fury could own the IBF title and he might choose to vacate the belt rather than face the Yoka-Hrgovic winner.

Fury can make more facing Anthony Joshua Oleksandr Usyk if he hasn’t fought them by 2023. Even if he has there’s more money for Fury in a rematch against either of those guys than in facing Yoka or Hrgovic.

“If you’re Parker he’s shown he can make some money” Mannix continued. “If you’re Ortiz you’re probably trying to cash put against Andy Ruiz or something. There are plenty more viable options.

“I think it’s a good fight Hrgovic against Yoka. I probably would have preferred Hrgovic against someone like Zhilei Zhang because maybe it’s a little more of a U.S fight then.

“Maybe we could do it in China in that area. Macao or something like that. That’s kind of a big event. Eddie Hearn has eye-balled big fights with Zhang over in China at some point.

“They’ve involved Anthony Joshua with those talks but I’d be kind of curious to see what kind of fan base he has over there in a big professional fight” said Mannix in talking about a fight that has no chance of happening due to Zhang’s low ranking [#13] with the IBF.

“And Zhilei Zhang is an older fighter [38] and is looking for this kind of opportunity” said Idec. “He got stuck in the pandemic and got stuck in China a couple of times.

“He trained here in New Jersey in a couple of towns from where I live. I’m very familiar with him and his story and everything. He [Zhang] can fight. He’s looking for the right dance partner so to speak.

“It would have been nice for him to get that opportunity but it looks like Eddie has to find him an opportunity elsewhere. He lives in a couple of towns away from me and it’s not a town where there’s a lot of Chinese people.

“There’s a lot of Italian people and he’s 6’6″. A lot of people think he’s a basketball player because he’s so tall.”

Zhilei Zhang would have been a poor choice for Hrgovic in an IBF title eliminator because he would be an obvious contest winner. Zhang is 38-years-old and recently fought to a controversial 10 round draw against journeyman Jerry Forrest.",,,,,,,,,

The measures have already confined tens of millions of people to their homes in several Chinese cities and contributed to a suspension of connecting flights through Hong Kong from much of the world for the next month. At least 20 million people or about 1.5 percent of China’s population are in lockdown mostly in the city of Xi’an in western China and in Henan Province in north-central China.

The country’s zero-tolerance policy has manufacturers — already on edge from spending the past two years dealing with crippling supply chain woes — worried about another round of shutdowns at Chinese factories and ports. Additional disruptions to the global supply chain would come at a particularly fraught moment for companies which are struggling with rising prices for raw materials and shipping along with extended delivery times and worker shortages.

China used lockdowns contact tracing and quarantines to halt the spread of the coronavirus nearly two years ago after its initial emergence in Wuhan. These tactics have been highly effective but the extreme transmissibility of the Omicron variant poses the biggest test yet of China’s system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL21pY3JvbnMtbmV3LW52bWUtbTItc3Nkcy1jYW4tcGFjay0ydGJzLWludG8tMjIzMC1mb3JtLWZhY3Rvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Micron's new NVMe M.2 SSDs can pack 2TBs into 2230 form factor,"Earlier this week in the unfortunate shadow of CES 2022 Micron released a 2TB M.2 2230 SSD which might just be the perfect upgrade for anyone out there interested in a beefier Steam Deck.

The reveal came during the announcement of Micron’s new 2400 SSD which uses what the company is boasting to be the ""industry's first 176-layer QLC NAND"". You can also find this new Micron NAND inside Crucial drives. Micron claims this means they can make SSDs smaller with greater performance. Those in this new series of 2400 SSDs have several configurable options when purchasing which include capacities from 512 GB to 2 TB as well as sizing options which include M.2 2042 2280 and of course 2230.

This is the first time we’re seeing a PCIe 4.0 SSD in the 2230 form factor with a capacity this large which is huge for portable PC Gaming. They also seem to be pretty great when it comes to power consumption keeping the highest capacity drive idling at 50% less than the previous generation coming in at under 150 mW which meets Intel’s lofty Project Athena goals.

The other impressive factor with these new tiny SSDs is a nice speedy sequential read speed of up to 4500MB/s. Micron says the new tech allows for 24% lower read latency and can offer up to 23% faster read times task depending. The write isn't so great ranging from 1800 to 4000MB/s depending on the storage. but given this feels like a gaming solution prioritising the read times is a smart idea. Most gamers aren’t too fussed about it taking a little extra time to install over getting nice fast loading speeds.

I wouldn’t be surprised if we see these cropping up in ultra slim gaming laptops in the near future and they sure do make a nice upgrade piece. For something like the Steam Deck that's set to release in February which specifically needs single-sided 2230 SSDs Micron’s newest efforts might be the only really viable option available at the moment. They might even work with Xbox Series X|S. That being said given there’s no mention of temperature real world examples we’d like to see these in action before recommending them outright.",,,,,,

April 2023 update – Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather. DEV-0586 is now tracked as Cadet Blizzard.

Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has identified evidence of a destructive malware operation targeting multiple organizations in Ukraine. This malware first appeared on victim systems in Ukraine on January 13 2022. Microsoft is aware of the ongoing geopolitical events in Ukraine and surrounding region and encourages organizations to use the information in this post to proactively protect from any malicious activity.

While our investigation is continuing MSTIC has not found any notable associations between this observed activity tracked as DEV-0586 and other known activity groups. MSTIC assesses that the malware which is designed to look like ransomware but lacking a ransom recovery mechanism is intended to be destructive and designed to render targeted devices inoperable rather than to obtain a ransom.

At present and based on Microsoft visibility our investigation teams have identified the malware on dozens of impacted systems and that number could grow as our investigation continues. These systems span multiple government non-profit and information technology organizations all based in Ukraine. We do not know the current stage of this attacker’s operational cycle or how many other victim organizations may exist in Ukraine or other geographic locations. However it is unlikely these impacted systems represent the full scope of impact as other organizations are reporting.

Given the scale of the observed intrusions MSTIC is not able to assess intent of the identified destructive actions but does believe these actions represent an elevated risk to any government agency non-profit or enterprise located or with systems in Ukraine. We strongly encourage all organizations to immediately conduct a thorough investigation and to implement defenses using the information provided in this post. MSTIC will update this blog as we have additional information to share.

As with any observed nation-state actor activity Microsoft directly and proactively notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised providing them with the information they need to guide their investigations. MSTIC is also actively working with members of the global security community and other strategic partners to share information that can address this evolving threat through multiple channels. Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown emerging or a developing cluster of threat activity allowing MSTIC to track it as a unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity. Once it meets the criteria a DEV is converted to a named actor or merged with existing actors.

Observed actor activity

On January 13 Microsoft identified intrusion activity originating from Ukraine that appeared to be possible Master Boot Records (MBR) Wiper activity. During our investigation we found a unique malware capability being used in intrusion attacks against multiple victim organizations in Ukraine.

Stage 1: Overwrite Master Boot Record to display a faked ransom note

The malware resides in various working directories including C:\PerfLogs C:\ProgramData C:\ and C:\temp and is often named stage1.exe. In the observed intrusions the malware executes via Impacket a publicly available capability often used by threat actors for lateral movement and execution.

The two-stage malware overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) on victim systems with a ransom note (Stage 1). The MBR is the part of a hard drive that tells the computer how to load its operating system. The ransom note contains a Bitcoin wallet and Tox ID (a unique account identifier used in the Tox encrypted messaging protocol) that have not been previously observed by MSTIC:

Your hard drive has been corrupted. In case you want to recover all hard drives of your organization You should pay us $10k via bitcoin wallet 1AVNM68gj6PGPFcJuftKATa4WLnzg8fpfv and send message via tox ID 8BEDC411012A33BA34F49130D0F186993C6A32DAD8976F6A5D82C1ED23054C057ECED5496F65 with your organization name. We will contact you to give further instructions.

The malware executes when the associated device is powered down. Overwriting the MBR is atypical for cybercriminal ransomware. In reality the ransomware note is a ruse and that the malware destructs MBR and the contents of the files it targets. There are several reasons why this activity is inconsistent with cybercriminal ransomware activity observed by MSTIC including:

Ransomware payloads are typically customized per victim. In this case the same ransom payload was observed at multiple victims.

Virtually all ransomware encrypts the contents of files on the filesystem. The malware in this case overwrites the MBR with no mechanism for recovery.

Explicit payment amounts and cryptocurrency wallet addresses are rarely specified in modern criminal ransom notes but were specified by DEV-0586. The same Bitcoin wallet address has been observed across all DEV-0586 intrusions and at the time of analysis the only activity was a small transfer on January 14.

It is rare for the communication method to be only a Tox ID an identifier for use with the Tox encrypted messaging protocol. Typically there are websites with support forums or multiple methods of contact (including email) to make it easy for the victim to successfully make contact.

Most criminal ransom notes include a custom ID that a victim is instructed to send in their communications to the attackers. This is an important part of the process where the custom ID maps on the backend of the ransomware operation to a victim-specific decryption key. The ransom note in this case does not include a custom ID.

Microsoft will continue to monitor DEV-0586 activity and implement protections for our customers. The current detections advanced detections and IOCs in place across our security products are detailed below.

Stage 2: File corrupter malware

Stage2.exe is a downloader for a malicious file corrupter malware. Upon execution stage2.exe downloads the next-stage malware hosted on a Discord channel with the download link hardcoded in the downloader. The next-stage malware can best be described as a malicious file corrupter. Once executed in memory the corrupter locates files in certain directories on the system with one of the following hardcoded file extensions:

.3DM .3DS .7Z .ACCDB .AI .ARC .ASC .ASM .ASP .ASPX .BACKUP .BAK .BAT .BMP .BRD .BZ .BZ2 .CGM .CLASS .CMD .CONFIG .CPP .CRT .CS .CSR .CSV .DB .DBF .DCH .DER .DIF .DIP .DJVU.SH .DOC .DOCB .DOCM .DOCX .DOT .DOTM .DOTX .DWG .EDB .EML .FRM .GIF .GO .GZ .HDD .HTM .HTML .HWP .IBD .INC .INI .ISO .JAR .JAVA .JPEG .JPG .JS .JSP .KDBX .KEY .LAY .LAY6 .LDF .LOG .MAX .MDB .MDF .MML .MSG .MYD .MYI .NEF .NVRAM .ODB .ODG .ODP .ODS .ODT .OGG .ONETOC2 .OST .OTG .OTP .OTS .OTT .P12 .PAQ .PAS .PDF .PEM .PFX .PHP .PHP3 .PHP4 .PHP5 .PHP6 .PHP7 .PHPS .PHTML .PL .PNG .POT .POTM .POTX .PPAM .PPK .PPS .PPSM .PPSX .PPT .PPTM .PPTX .PS1 .PSD .PST .PY .RAR .RAW .RB .RTF .SAV .SCH .SHTML .SLDM .SLDX .SLK .SLN .SNT .SQ3 .SQL .SQLITE3 .SQLITEDB .STC .STD .STI .STW .SUO .SVG .SXC .SXD .SXI .SXM .SXW .TAR .TBK .TGZ .TIF .TIFF .TXT .UOP .UOT .VB .VBS .VCD .VDI .VHD .VMDK .VMEM .VMSD .VMSN .VMSS .VMTM .VMTX .VMX .VMXF .VSD .VSDX .VSWP .WAR .WB2 .WK1 .WKS .XHTML .XLC .XLM .XLS .XLSB .XLSM .XLSX .XLT .XLTM .XLTX .XLW .YML .ZIP

If a file carries one of the extensions above the corrupter overwrites the contents of the file with a fixed number of 0xCC bytes (total file size of 1MB). After overwriting the contents the destructor renames each file with a seemingly random four-byte extension. Analysis of this malware is ongoing.

Recommended customer actions

MSTIC and the Microsoft security teams are working to create and implement detections for this activity. To date Microsoft has implemented protections to detect this malware family as WhisperGate (e.g. DoS:Win32/WhisperGate.A!dha) via Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint wherever these are deployed on-premises and cloud environments. We are continuing the investigation and will share significant updates with affected customers as well as public and private sector partners as get more information. The techniques used by the actor and described in the this post can be mitigated by adopting the security considerations provided below:

Use the included indicators of compromise to investigate whether they exist in your environment and assess for potential intrusion.

Review all authentication activity for remote access infrastructure with a particular focus on accounts configured with single factor authentication to confirm authenticity and investigate any anomalous activity.

Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) to mitigate potentially compromised credentials and ensure that MFA is enforced for all remote connectivity. NOTE: Microsoft strongly encourages all customers download and use password-less solutions like Microsoft Authenticator to secure accounts.

Enable Controlled folder Access (CFA) in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to prevent MBR/VBR modification.

Indicators of compromise (IOCs)

The following list provides IOCs observed during our investigation. We encourage customers to investigate these indicators in their environments and implement detections and protections to identify past related activity and prevent future attacks against their systems.

I unleashed Microsoft Woke as its right-wing critics might call it on some passages about gendered and genderless pronouns to see whether it could read for inclusivity better than a human can.

tl;dr: it can’t. But you knew this.

Here’s what happened. The following screencap comes from my book What’s Your Pronoun? Beyond he and she (Liveright 2020) which traces the history and politics of gendered and genderless pronouns.

Word highlighted men and women suggesting I replace them with a gender-neutral term like people to be more inclusive. But the claim I make in this paragraph is that common-gender pronouns in the 18th and 19th centuries (we call them gender-neutral or genderless pronouns today) were typically conceived as binary. Singular they used in English since the 14th century and early coined pronouns like E (1841) thon (1858) se (ca. 1874) heer (1911) hir (1920) and heesh (1930) typically included the two traditional genders masculine and feminine something that so-called generic he often failed to do. Early coiners though they strove for gender inclusiveness did not provide for anyone whose gender did not fit the traditional binary. Only in the later 20th century did the concept of genderless pronouns expand to include trans nonbinary and genderfluid people along with the binary masculine and feminine. Sometimes you just have to use words like men and women. So thanks MS Woke but no thanks.

The next example is from my discussion of pronouns in Virginia Woolf’s novel Orlando which appeared in 1928. About a third of the way into the novel Woolf describes the transition of her protagonist Orlando a thirty-year-old man (pronouns he/his/him) who falls into a deep and mysterious sleep and awakens some time later as a woman (she/her). Woolf captures the moment of Orlando’s transition in her narrative and in the rough draft she illustrates it grammatically as well. Over the course of several sentences she shifts Orlando’s pronouns from he and his to he/she and his/her and finally to she and her. As we see in the screencap the pronoun transitions get tricky once you get to the reflexive himself: “The sound of trumpets died away & Orlando stood for a moment in all his/her beauty stark naked. Then he/she dressed himself.”

Orlando starts out the book as he becomes he/she at the moment of transition and continues for the next 200 years as she (Orlando lives for a very long time). But Microsoft thinks Woolf could do better. Instead of he/she Word advises “A gender-neutral pronoun here would be more inclusive.” Maybe so but Word offers no gender advice for the reflexive pronoun himself. If Woolf took Word’s advice she’d wind up with “Then they dressed himself.”

Woolf did revise the passage but not in the way MS Word suggests. The printed version of Orlando leaves out this confusion of pronouns: “The sound of the trumpets died away and Orlando stood stark naked.”

Finally here’s a bit from a blog post I wrote about the new French genderless pronoun iel. We’ve seen Word’s context-insensitive takes on inclusivity. Here we see that Word’s grammar checker is not too good at grammar.

First a bit of history. Lo the first French genderless pronoun was coined in 1765 by Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve. It wasn’t until 1841 that an American Francis A. Brewster got into the pronoun coining game. Brewster wasn’t particularly “woke”—he was a recent Yale MD who didn’t like the work wrote a widely-ignored grammar book and wound up selling insurance. Not the profile of your typical 19th-century progressive. But Brewster did coin E the first gender-neutral English pronoun a word meant to include both women and men though—and this is tantalizing—Brewster called his new pronoun not common-gender or gender-neutral but “masculor feminine” from a Latin word meaning ‘hermaphrodite.’

Brewster’s use of masculor feminine is surely the first hint at fluid gender reference in an English grammar book so maybe Dr. Brewster was just a little bit woke after all. In contrast MS Woke seems to be asleep on the job. The utility parses was as a helping verb and advises me to call Brewster “waking” instead of “woke.” But that’s wrong. Woke is an adjective and was is the main verb not an auxiliary. The passage about Brewster ends with this sentence (not shown in the image above): “Brewster did quit doctoring—he wound up selling insurance.” Here Word makes another category error objecting to my use of wound up saying “these words work best when connected by a hyphen.” O Word do pardon me wound up is a verb not a noun.

So much then for Word’s “Grammar & Refinements.” Its suggestions are neither grammatical nor refined.

Inclusive language is a big issue today as it has been at various times in the past. Remember the debates over Ms. chair and waitron in the 1970s? The continual shifts in neutral terms to describe racial ethnic and religious groups? Shifting terms to describe physical and psychological illness and abilities? Inclusive language has always been controversial and today some staunch conservatives charge that it’s a form of thought-control. But language that excludes can be even more controlling. It's certainly more offensive. Yes the explicit goal of some writers is to be offensive—Have I offended everyone? is a staple of in-your-face stand-up comedy. But no writer wants to be inadvertently offensive and that’s where sensitivity reading helps the most.

So I’m all for sensitivity reading. I just don’t think Microsoft Word is sensitive enough to do that. Sorry if I’ve offended anyone in Redmond or on the internets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9taWNyb3NvZnQtYXp1cmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Azure review,"Azure is an interesting service for knowledgeable users who need Microsoft integration but everyone else will find cheaper and more streamlined CDNs elsewhere.

The CDN can be managed from PowerShell or .NET a big plus for many developers and sysadmins as well as via a REST API and Node.js.

Azure's Standard plan covers the basics: custom domain name support (cdn.mydomain.com) HTTPS support HTTP/2 geo-filtering (block access by country) load balancing and DDoS protection.

One not-so-common Standard Verizon addition is ""asset pre-loading"" which enables specifying objects to be cached before they're requested. The first request from each region then gets the file immediately without having to wait as it's fetched from the origin.

The full-fat 'Premium Verizon' plan extends the CDN with real-time stats and alerts advanced HTTP reports token authentication (hotlink protection) and a more powerful rules engine to change cache or header settings redirect URLs and generally play around with content delivery. Although other CDNs typically offer some of this functionality as standard Microsoft's implementation is impressive.

Getting a full picture of the CDN's capabilities proved more difficult than we expected as even some basic information isn't clearly presented on the site. Curious about the number of PoPs available with each network for instance? That's not disclosed for the Akamai plan Microsoft's own figures are only mentioned on the Locations page (118 PoPs across 100 cities) and the company recommends you ignore these anyway and try each of the plans to see which works best.

If you're interested in Azure then we'd recommend you start with the official CDN Comparison page look at the various features and follow the links to get detailed explanations. Check out the CDN Documentation page too. Search for features like purge or whatever else is a priority and make sure the plans deliver what you'd expect.

Pricing

Microsoft Azure CDN uses a pay-as-you-go scheme where you're charged for the level of bandwidth you use. As with Amazon CloudFront and many other CDNs data transfer prices vary depending on region they're using.

The Standard Akamai and Standard Verizon plans are priced similarly to Amazon CloudFront with charges starting at $0.081 per GB for North America Europe the Middle East and Africa ranging up to $0.233 for South America. Rates drop after the first 10TB depending on the amount you use so for example if you're in North America and use 150TB a month the last 100TB costs $0.056 per GB.

The Premium Verizon plan costs roughly twice as much for the first 10TB of traffic ($0.158 to $0.466 per GB) and again there are discounts if you use more.

Overall costs of even the Standard plans can be twice that of competitors like KeyCDN let alone budget services like Bunny (priced from $0.005/ GB.) They're cheaper than many high-end enterprise CDNs though and the integration with Microsoft technologies may make this a price worth paying for some.

If you'd like to get a feel for your costs the Azure site has a Pricing Calculator to help you figure out your monthly bill. Choose a plan enter a traffic estimate for each region and the total is displayed immediately. Keep in mind that tech support is priced from a $29 a month for trial use or $100 for 'for small or medium-sized companies with minimal business-critical dependence on Azure.' But if that's too much for you don't necessarily let it put you off as there's a vast and hugely detailed web knowledgebase available for free.

Alternatively sign up for Azure and you'll get $200 free credit for 30 days use. This could give you more than 1500GB of traffic enough to trial even the largest of sites and it doesn't automatically renew as a paid product so there's no risk.

Setup

The Azure web dashboard is complex crammed with features and functionality and the most expert user might initially struggle to find their way around. For example a left-hand sidebar covers 23 different areas (Function Apps SQL Databases Load Balancers Virtual Machines) each of which leads to its own management panel with yet more options.

(Image credit: Microsoft)

Typing ‘CDN’ in the Search box led us to the right area but even there terminology like ‘CDN profile’ and ‘resource group’ may seem unfamiliar. Our first attempt to create a CDN profile generated the error 'please ensure that Microsoft.CDN is listed as a registered Resource Provider in your Azure subscription' with no link to explain the issue further. Searching for the answer first got us a page recommending we run some PowerShell but then directed us to a portal solution which turned out to be quick and easy.

Play around for a while though and the system starts to make more sense. Create a CDN profile and you can add multiple zones. You're able to define their type (Storage Cloud Service Web App more) and URL. Each can have a sensibly-named CDN domain too like mytestdomain.azureedge.net.

An optional Dynamic Site Optimization feature accelerates performance with route and TCP optimizations and object prefetch and mobile image compression with Akamai. This isn't cheap with prices starting at $0.19 but the $200 of free credit means you can at least try before you buy.

Once you're set up Azure works much like any other CDN. Edit your code to use the ""mytestdomain.azureedge.net"" CDN URL (or add a CNAME record to use a custom domain name) with assets you'd like to cache and the system will load them on the first request and start serving them to visitors.

Access an Endpoint and you're finally able to explore Azure's CDN settings. These turn out to be flexible too far more so than much of the competition. You don't just click a button to turn compression on and off for instance – you're able to define exactly which MIME types you'd like optimized.

It's easy to decide how the service treats URLs with query strings too (page.ashx?q=this). In a click or two you can choose to bypass caching for queries (the asset is grabbed from the origin each time) cache the first request and always serve that asset or treat every request as a unique URL (page.ashx?q=this and page.ashx?q=that would be cached as separate assets each with their own time to live).

Geo-filtering is well-handled with no need to learn coding techniques or create scripts. Instead you're able to specify individual files or folders then allow or block them from your choice of countries.

When you've collected enough data Azure also provides assorted reports and analytics to help you understand what's going.

Other tools are more cryptic and the interface doesn't always offer much upfront help in figuring out how they work. You'll also run into Azure's management features hugely powerful in themselves. Need to share control of the CDN with others in your business for instance? There's a vast Access Control system where you're able to create users groups and roles and define exactly who can do what.

If you think this sounds complicated then you're right. There is a vast amount of documentation available (this sample tutorial is a good example) and eventually you'll master the basics but beware: it might take a while.

Performance

Will Azure CDN deliver the speed you need? There's really no way to say for sure as there are so many variables to consider – the locations of your visitors the Azure plan you're using the size and types of files the web applications and whether you're using extras like Azure's Dynamic Site Optimization.

CDNPerf offers a starting point by comparing CDN response times experienced by real users across the globe. It's a single figure and can't offer any definitive verdict but still provides a basic view of how the edge servers compare.

As we write CDNPerf.com currently ranks Azure CDN a disappointing 16th out of 21 contenders with an average worldwide response time of 38.29ms.

There's a tiny consolation for Microsoft in that it still beat some big names including CDN.NET (42.49ms) Cloudflare CDN (51.34ms) and OVH CDN (59.93ms.)

But the reality is Azure CDN trailed a very long way behind the likes of 5centsCDN (24.15ms) Google Cloud CDN (24.51ms) and AWS CloudFront CDN (25.51ms.)

These figures are worldwide averages and sometimes a CDN performs much better (or worse) in particular countries or continents.

Azure CDN though was unspectacular just about everywhere with a best speed placing of 11th in Asia and a worst of 18th in Europe.

That's not exactly encouraging but as we mentioned above these results won't necessarily reflect what you'll see. If Azure's feature set is a perfect fit for your project then it could still be a smart choice.

Final verdict

Azure CDN is a must-see if you'll use other Azure services or might appreciate the .NET or PowerShell management features but its complexity and cost mean that less demanding users might be better off elsewhere.

Destructive malware capable of wiping data has appeared on dozens of computer systems at Ukrainian organizations including government agencies non-profits and technology organizations Microsoft has warned.

The disclosure is an added worry for Ukrainian government agencies after many of their websites were hacked this week and replaced with threatening messages to Ukrainians that their data had been compromised.

While it is unclear who was responsible for the dual cybersecurity incidents they come as Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukraine border and after talks between the West and Moscow have failed to deescalate the situation.

The “destructive” computer code represents “an elevated risk to any government agency non-profit or enterprise located or with systems in Ukraine” Microsoft said in a blog post Saturday.

Microsoft researchers said the computer code was designed to look like ransomware but that it lacked some of the common features of ransomware and was “inconsistent with cybercriminal ransomware activity.”

Scores of Ukrainian government websites were hacked between Thursday and Friday many of them apparently via a single software provider named Kitsoft.

The Kyiv-based firm said Friday it was helping government websites restore connectivity. Ukrainian officials have said no personal data was leaked in the hacks.

Serhiy Demedyuk deputy secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defense council told Reuters that Ukraine blamed a hacking group linked with Belarusian intelligence for the website hacks. CNN has reached out to the Belarusian foreign ministry for comment.

Russia-linked hacking groups have a long history of wreaking havoc in Ukraine. The US Justice Department has blamed Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency for cyberattacks in 2015 and 2016 that cut power in parts of Ukraine and for a crippling piece of malware known as NotPetya.

In 2017 NotPetya was unleashed on a Ukrainian accounting software firm but the malicious code spread to multinational corporations like shipping giant Maersk costing the global economy billions of dollars.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMTYvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWludmVzdG9yLWxhbWItc2Vlcy1jaGFuZ2UtYWZ0ZXItaGFyYXNzbWVudC1yZXBvcnQtdm90ZS5odG1s0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDEvMTYvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWludmVzdG9yLWxhbWItc2Vlcy1jaGFuZ2UtYWZ0ZXItaGFyYXNzbWVudC1yZXBvcnQtdm90ZS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft investor who pushed shareholder vote on harassment report says change is coming,"Natasha Lamb was shocked. It was November and Microsoft shareholders had just agreed with her proposal to push the software maker into issuing a public report on the effectiveness of its sexual harassment policies.

Microsoft opposed the measure and urged investors to vote it down. But the company lost and because of the decision Microsoft said on Thursday that it will review its policies and issue a report in the spring.

""It's so rare to get a majority vote"" Lamb a founding partner and portfolio manager at impact investment firm Arjuna Capital said in an interview after Microsoft made its announcement last week. Arjuna owns a stake in Microsoft worth close to $20 million according to a regulatory filing.

Lamb said she was pleased with Microsoft's commitment to hire a law firm to conduct an independent assessment and look into executive level cases including one involving Bill Gates Microsoft's co-founder and former CEO.

In the past these sorts of shareholder proposals were as much for show as anything and almost never passed. But support for such initiatives is becoming more common as investors focus on environmental social and governance (ESG) matters and look for companies that are taking them seriously.

Issues such as harassment and social justice started gaining traction around the time of the #MeToo movement in 2017 and picked up momentum after the 2020 death of George Floyd while in police custody.

Asset managers like Arjuna are looking for more companies to talk publicly about their efforts to improve diversity and weed out bad actors just as they've long focused on revenue growth and profit margins. They're even voting against board members who they see as standing in the way of progress.

In the 12 months that ended in June 29 environmental and social shareholder proposals won majority support up from 16 the prior year according to an analysis from advisory firm FTI Consulting .

""They are getting higher levels of support the 'E' and the 'S'"" said Darla Stuckey CEO of the nonprofit Society for Corporate Governance and a former assistant secretary at American Express .

Big money managers are driving the pressure campaigns a trend that started two to three years ago according to Lamb.

""Historically Vanguard State Street BlackRock  all those folks didn't vote on ESG issues"" Lamb said. ""They just voted with management. And that has changed. Those folks reach out to me now and want to ask questions and talk about the proposals.""

That's helped Arjuna's growth.

""Client demand is changing and more people are reflecting on what needs to change in the world and how they want to put their money to work and we're seeing inflows because of that"" Lamb said.

Microsoft is one of the companies that's been in Arjuna's sights. Last year reports surfaced that Gates had pursued a sexual relationship with an employee in 2000. The shareholder proposal also alluded to a 2012 class-action lawsuit against Microsoft in which 238 employees alleged sexual harassment."

The president’s chief medical advisor and his wife had $10.4 million in investments at the end of 2020 newly-released records show.

That sum — including $2.3 million in unrealized gains — was held in various mutual funds.

Fauci’s 2020 financial disclosure was released publicly Friday night by Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) who Fauci had called a “moron” after he inquired into Fauci’s financial disclosures during a Senate proceeding Tuesday.

“Dr. Fauci was completely dishonest about his financial disclosures being open to the public” Marshall said in a statement. “Dr. Fauci must be held accountable to all Americans who have been suing and requesting for this information but don’t have the power of a Senate office to ask for it.”

Fauci’s 2020 filing — not previously available to the public — details the finances of the nation’s highest-paid federal employee who reportedly made $434312 in 2020 and is on track for a $350000 annual pension upon retirement.

In a mix of trust and retirement accounts he and his wife hold Atlas large-cap mutual funds Pimco’s investment-grade bond fund and a tax-exempt municipal debt fund.

Other holdings include the Pax Ellevate Global Women’s Leadership Fund — which invests in companies highly-rated for “advancing women through gender-diverse boards senior leadership teams and other policies and practices” — and the Matthews Pacific Tiger Fund which focuses on East Asian nations in particular China but excluding Japan.

The filing also disclosed between $250000 and $500000 in a money-market account and between $50000 and $100000 in a 529 tuition account.

Fauci also reported a stake worth between $1000 and $15000 in Jackson Fillmore a trattoria in San Francisco within the district of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “The pasta dishes at Jackson are simple and straightforward but taste like they are made with love” an Infatuation reviewer wrote.

On the income side Fauci was paid between $100000 and $1 million in royalties by McGraw-Hill. And he reported $8100 in honoria and travel reimbursements for virtually appearing at three galas including the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation’s “Ripple of Hope.”

He also got $5198 from the Partnership for Public Service after being named the non-profit’s 2020 federal employee of the year.

Fauci’s finances received new scrutiny this week after Fauci said the “misinformed” Sen. Marshall only had to “ask for” his 2020 disclosure which he said was available to the public.

Fauci’s employer the National Institutes for Health turned over the documents to Marshall on Friday in response to a strongly-worded letter.

But Fauci’s salary for 2021 and 2022 still have yet to be released according to Adam Andrzejewski of OpenTheBooks.com.

The conservative non-profit Judicial Watch sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — NIH’s parent — for documents related to Fauci’s financial affairs in October 2021. HHS has proposed beginning monthly releases starting on Feb. 1 according to court papers.

Thomas Fitton president of Judicial Watch accused the NIH of playing a “shell game” with Fauci’s records.

His 2019 financial disclosure was released by NIH in 2020 after a Freedom of Information Act request from a reporter.

But NIH has never explained the redactions in the 2019 disclosure — or why it processed that document under FOIA when it told media outlets last week including The Post that Fauci’s 2020 filing would need to be requested from the federal Office of Government Ethics through another process.

This world-class partnership will see an unmissable promotion rolling out across key OREO products both on-pack and off-pack as well as a unique Batman-embossed biscuit to drive real excitement in store from mid- January.

Shoppers simply scan the QR code on pack for their chances to win instant cinema tickets daily as well as the star prize of a VIP trip to Gotham City at Warner Bros. World in Abu Dhabi. Core OREO packs will be transformed for the promotion with biscuits that are embossed with Batman’s image and an exciting new Gotham skyline wrap to grab consumers’ attention from the shelf.

These promotional packs will be available from mid-January onwards ahead of the film’s release on the 4th March 2022. The campaign follows previous activations from the OREO brand featuring other iconic figures such as Lady Gaga and Super Mario which helped to drive relevance for the globally-leading range. The collaboration with Batman is set to be the brand’s biggest partnership of its kind with significant social digital PR OOH and in-store support behind the campaign.

Rafael Espesani Senior Brand Manager for OREO at Mondelēz International says: “‘The Batman’ is one of 2022’s most highly anticipated releases and so we wanted to create something really exciting for OREO-lovers and Batman fans across the UK combining the two global icons of popular culture and generate excitement in store. This promotion sees the ultimate crossover bringing the Gotham skyline to the biscuit fixture and driving incremental sales for retailers while offering a playful twist to the film.”

The limited-edition packaging and embossed biscuits will roll out across OREO 154g Original OREO 154g Original PMP OREO Twin Pack and OREO 66g from mid-January. Retailers should stock up on OREO’s biggest selling packs to make the most of this unmissable promotion.

The new acquisition adds six craft beer companies to the collection at Monster. Along with DEBC the Monster portfolio instantly expands through the simultaneous procurement of Cigar City Oskar Blues Perrin Brewing Squatters and Wasatch.

Monster–most popularized for its energy drinks–now deep dives albeit virginally into the liquor realm through the CANarchy acquisition.

“This transaction provides us with a springboard from which to enter the alcoholic beverage sector” said Monster’s Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Hilton Schlosberg. “The acquisition will provide us with a fully in-place infrastructure including people distribution and licenses along with alcoholic beverage development expertise and manufacturing capabilities in this industry.”

This latest development is another chapter in the CANarchy chronicles. The Craft Brewery Collective is still embroiled in a lawsuit with DEBC Founder John Reardon fired in 2020 after CANarchy purchased a majority of DEBC in 2018.

Reardon claims that he was not compensated by CANarchy as agreed (as part of the original 2018 sale).

The lawsuit claims that CANarchy did not promote and distribute a healthy supply of Deep Ellum Brewing products causing sales of the brand to slump and Reardon not to get the earnouts that he maintains he deserves.

In a statement Monster disclosed that the transaction with CANarchy will be completed during the first quarter of 2022. CANarchy will function independently from the energy drink division of Monster.

Venture firms in particular are placing huge new bets on the crypto market: FTX the crypto exchange just launched a $2 billion fund competing with similarly sized funds from a16z ($2.2 billion) and Paradigm ($2.5 billion) last year. On the other side however Jamie Dimon says “cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value” and called bitcoin “worthless.”

There are a couple of different things going on here. The VCs are focused on the Next Big Thing and believe that the blockchain technologies behind digital currencies smart contracts and NFTs will lead to a whole new architecture for the Internet and a wave of important new businesses that could become the next Google Amazon or Meta. They are raising these big funds or have already raised them with the intention of placing lots of bets on what they hope this future will look like.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAxLTE1L2V2ZW4tYWZ0ZXItYmlnLXByaWNlLWN1dHMtdGhlc2UtdGVjaC1zdG9ja3MtYXJlLW5vLWJhcmdhaW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Even After Big Price Cuts These Tech Stocks Are No Bargains,"Why did this happen?

Can they really replace a human financial advisor?,"d3sign

Robots want to be your next financial advisor. Not too long ago that notion may have smacked of sci-fi whimsy — ""Star Wars"" cyborg C-3PO in a power suit on Wall Street perhaps. But robots or so-called ""robo-advisors"" may soon manage more than $1 trillion of Americans' wealth. These aren't actually tangible robots; they're algorithms companies have developed to automate digital investing. Plug some details (age savings goals risk comfort) into a computer or phone app and the algorithm assembles and manages a personalized investment portfolio just for you. More from Personal Finance:

New York's eviction ban expires Saturday. What renters need to know

Divorced? You can collect Social Security benefits from an ex-spouse But is a robo-advisor right for all investors? Is a human better-equipped for the task of money management and financial planning? ""It's suitable for some people and not for others"" Ivory Johnson a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington D.C. said of robo-advisors. ""If you play golf it's just a different golf club. ""Sometimes I use my 7-iron and sometimes I don't — it just depends on where I am.""

Robo-advisors for the everyday investor began popping up around 2008 the year after the iPhone made its public debut. Just over a decade later robo-advisors were managing about $785 billion according to Backend Benchmarking which specializes in research on digital advisors. Dozens of firms have built their own models to capitalize on popularity and an ascendant digital culture.

They include independent shops like Betterment Personal Capital and Wealthfront; traditional Wall Street brokerages like Fidelity Investments Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley; and those like Financial Engines that cater to 401(k) plan investors. Established players that have historically focused on an older wealthier client base can also leverage the technology to court a new class of younger investors who've shown an enthusiasm for the digital financial realm via online stock trading apps like Robinhood and for assets like cryptocurrency. ""They're everywhere now"" David Goldstone research and analytics manager at Backend Benchmarking said of robo-advisors. ""Just about every major bank and discount broker launched one in the past decade.""

Who's a good candidate?

Robots tend to be especially well-suited to newer investors who haven't yet built much wealth and who would like to outsource money management to a professional for a reasonably low cost according to industry experts. For one robo-advisors offer a low barrier to entry due to low or nonexistent account minimums. Acorns Fidelity Go Betterment and Ellevest a robo service for women let clients sign up for their baseline digital service without any prior wealth. Merrill Edge Guided Investing SigFig SoFi Vanguard Group and Wealthfront have minimums ranging from a few dollars up to $3000. Meanwhile traditional firms tend to manage money for clients with at least $250000 to invest Goldstone said. It's perhaps unsurprising that the average robo user skews younger. For example about 90% of the 470000 clients at Wealthfront are under 40 said Elly Stolnitz a company spokeswoman. Their average balance is about $60000.

I think it attracts people who want to delegate away management of their portfolio. Dan Egan vice president of behavioral finance and investing at Betterment

That demographic trend is also a function of a greater digital affinity among millennials and Generation Z who largely grew up as digital natives and may be more attracted to a robo service as a result. ""[Our users] want to be able to manage money the same way they manage other things like [online food delivery via] DoorDash"" Stolnitz said. Betterment also has an average user younger than 40 with a $55000 to $60000 account according to Dan Egan the firm's vice president of behavioral finance and investing. But age and wealth aren't the only factors at play he said. The company has clients in their 60s and 70s with multimillion-dollar portfolios; the oldest user is over 90. ""I think it attracts people who want to delegate away management of their portfolio"" Egan said.

Fees for that management are typically much lower than for a traditional financial advisor charging 1% a year on client assets. The typical robo charges 0.25% to 0.35% annually for their advice service — about a fourth of the cost Goldstone said. In dollar terms that means an investor with $100000 would pay the typical human $1000 a year for their services and $250 to the average robo. (Of course not all human advisors charge a 1% fee. Some have shifted to monthly subscription fees or one-time consultation fees for example.) Some robo-advisors like Charles Schwab and SoFi don't levy any advice fee; others like Fidelity and SigFig only charge on balances of more than $10000. Investments in the portfolio — often low-cost index mutual funds or exchange-traded funds — do carry an additional fee. Some firms invest clients in their name-brand funds which boosts their revenue via fund fees. They may also levy higher account minimums or fees for tiered service levels. ""If you don't have a lot of money you're in your 20s and 30s the portfolios are pretty damn good"" said William Whitt a strategic advisor at Aite-Novarica Group a consulting firm.

Using a purely digital service may come with trade-offs. While digital services do a good job of automating important investment functions (fund choice the stock-bond-cash mix and regular portfolio rebalancing for example) human advisors lament the relative inability of algorithmic programs to talk clients through situations on demand. Those may include the reasoning behind a specific strategy recommendation or handholding in daunting times like job loss or a cratering stock market. Financial planners also believe they're better suited for proactivity and delving into needs of some clients beyond money management — whether tax estate or business planning which may prove too complex or nuanced for an online questionnaire for example. ""We do a lot more than just investing"" said Johnson at Delancey Wealth Management. Helping a client choose whether to exercise stock options buy long-term-care or liability insurance or set up a business as an LLC or another type of entity are likely beyond the scope of a digital advisor Johnson said.

It's also a challenge to automate client psychology. The online questionnaires robo-advisors use to determine the best portfolio for a client can't probe answers and body language in the same way a human advisor might Whitt said. Even determining what makes a client happy — in essence the purpose behind their money — may be beyond the scope of robots according to some experts. ""Financial advisors can ask follow-up questions to fill out a picture and understand"" Whitt said. The Securities and Exchange Commission which conducted a recent review of robo-advice services also questioned whether they always recommended appropriate portfolios given clients' stated risk tolerance. (The agency didn't name specific firms it examined.) Of course not all human advisors are necessarily performing these functions appropriately either. Some may purely manage client investments without assessing goals or other complex financial-planning details — and in this case clients might get more value from a robo-advice relationship. ""I think there's value humans provide"" said Brian Walsh SoFi's senior manager of financial planning. ""But on the investment side I think robos have a huge advantage in being cost-efficient.""

Located in the Rio Grande Valley the county’s unique economic and cultural mosaic is attracting people and businesses to the region.

Home to approximately 424000 people Cameron County includes the cities of Brownsville and Harlingen and popular tourism destinations including San Padre Island and Port Isabel. The Rio Grande Valley offers a unique and unsurpassed quality of living with year-round warm temperatures stunning natural geography complete with beaches riverfront and resacas (ancient channels carved by the Rio Grande) top-notch institutions of higher education and an exceptionally low cost of living too. The county’s cost of living index is 72.5 compared to the U.S. average of 100.

As part of the four-county Rio Grande Valley Cameron County is poised for explosive growth. According to census data the Rio Grande Valley region is larger than 15 other U.S. states and territories and is expected to grow according to population estimates.

Boasting three higher education institutions — the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley Texas Southmost College and Texas State Technical College — Cameron County also offers ample opportunities for students to advance their skills and training.

In addition to offering its residents a high quality of life Cameron County’s business climate is thriving.

The Brownsville Borderplex region is home to various industries including advanced manufacturing heavy manufacturing aerospace automotive medical retail aviation international logistics and food processing. In addition several industries maintain a strong foothold in Harlingen including health and biotechnology automotive and industrial supply logistics and aerospace. South Padre Island’s miles of pristine shoreline tropical scenery wildlife and exciting attractions lure thousands of tourists to the county every year.

While mainstay industries are continuing to grow in the county several high-profile innovative companies including SpaceX Paragon and others have chosen to establish a base of operations in the county.

Mark Yates Director of Economic Development and Community Affairs in Cameron County said the region’s sky-high growth is inevitable as high-tech industries continue to expand throughout the county and the state. As a life-long resident that’s something he likes to see and is actively working to attract.

“People are starting to find out about us but we want the rest of the world to know what we have here. There’s a lot going on here” Yates said. “We’re a low-tax environment and we have no state income tax. We have plenty of land for development. When we have an industry that wants to move here we rally the universities and the workforce board to make sure we can respond to the needs of that industry. We have a few incentives for business including our Opportunity Zones the Foreign Trade Zone the Freeport Tax exemptions. We have qualifying tax abatement incentives and Tax Increment Financing Zones too.”

Small businesses are well-supported in Cameron County. The county’s Certified Development Coproration is working with local lending institutions to provide Small Business Administration loans. Yates said the county understands small businesses are the key to creating jobs and spurring economic growth in the county and broader region. “Our vision is that access to capital is the greatest barrier to small business start-up and sustainability” he explained.

International Connections

With “front door” access to Mexico two commercial airports and a deepwater port in the Gulf of Mexico the region offers a cadre of logistical advantages. Five international bridges cross into Mexico and offer dedicated commercial lanes that provide convenient access to Foreign Trade Zone 62 anchored at the Port of Brownsville. FTZ 62 is consistently ranked among the top three U.S. FTZs for exports. With 2300 acres available it is also one of the largest in the country and the largest in the state.

Across the border Matamoros Tamaulipas is a thriving manufacturing hub in Northern Mexico. The region is home to a cluster of 50 automotive companies and 150 manufacturing plants. This proximity makes Cameron County a central link in the supply-chain-logistics of the North America “Auto Alley.”

Additionally the population in the Brownsville/Matamoros metropolitan region is over 800000. Ramiro Aleman Director of Business Recruitment Retention and Expansion for the Greater Brownsville Incentives Corporation said Brownsville and the Rio Grande Valley have always maintained strong economic and cultural ties with Mexico.

“Mexican shoppers cross the border daily to shop and visit our tourist attractions like the Gladys Porter Zoo Brownsville Farmer’s Market and even events like the world-renowned Charro Days Festival a binational celebration of cultural and economic ties” said Aleman. “Also there are several companies mainly in the automotive sector that practice the “twin plant” system in which corporations have operations on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. This has long been a main economic driver in the area and continues to this day.”

Reaching Global Markets

Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño Jr. said the Port of Brownsville is one of the biggest economic engines in Cameron County highlighting the port’s limitless potential as one of the few that still have plenty of space for companies to grow into. Currently home to 273 companies including the largest steel movers in the county the Port is responsible for over 51000 jobs in the region and $3 billion in annual state economic activity.

The Port of Brownsville is the only deepwater port located on the U.S. Mexico border and handles a variety of cargo products including steel liquid breakbulk and dry bulk commodities. In addition the port has approximately 40000 acres of land available for development and 17 miles of waterfront access providing direct access to non-congested international bridge crossings and rail connections.

The Port of Brownsville is currently deepening the port’s ship channel from its current 42-foot draft to 52 feet. When complete the Port of Brownsville will become one of the deepest ports on the Gulf of Mexico and will be able to accommodate larger vessels.

Additionally the Cameron County Regional Mobility Authority (CCRMA) is beginning work on a new $16 million Port Connector Road that will be vital to the success of the Port of Brownsville as it continues to attract investments from companies in the space industry and the liquid natural gas industry. In addition to several other infrastructure improvement projects across the county CCRMA is also improving the flow of commercial traffic at the Veterans International Bridge which handles most of Cameron County’s international traffic between the bridge and the Port of Brownsville.

Meanwhile the Port of Brownsville is also becoming a base for shipbuilding and shipbreaking operations. In 2019 the Port of Brownsville facilitated shipbuilder Keppel AmFELS’s expansion at the port. The company constructs mobile drilling rigs and platforms at its 165-acre facility. On the opposite end of the shipbuilding spectrum SteelCoast LLC is part of the Port of Brownsville’s ship recycling operations a legacy industry that captures more than 85% of the U.S. Navy and MARAD ship recycling business. SteelCoast dismantles and recycles both military and non-military oceangoing vessels from around the globe. The company also dismantles decommissioned oil rigs trains rail cars and other industrial and commercial recyclable metals.

Thanks to a steady stream of naval contracts SteelCoast’s workforce is expected to triple this year to 240 a pronounced increment from the 77 dedicated employees the company had in the last year.

As supply chain issues continue to grip the West Coast assets like the Port of Brownsville are helping to encourage investments in the region. In addition to the Port of Brownsville the region offers two intracoastal canal ports in Harlingen and Port Isabel.

Amy Lynch Director of Public Relations and Marketing for the Port of Harlingen said the ports in Cameron County haven’t been affected by the global supply chain issues other ports are dealing with across the country.

“Our access to the inland waterways is one of our biggest strengths” Lynch said. “Come through the Port of Harlingen and you can reach as far as the Great Lakes. We have access to both the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway as well as the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. So don’t think of us in terms of just Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. We are a stop along thousands of miles of access to markets up along the Mississippi River.”

In November The Port of Harlingen reported a 29% increase in total tonnage for fiscal year ‘20-’21 with 3013124 tons of cargo shipped in and out of the port. Since 2017 The Port of Harlingen has experienced a 112% growth in cargo volume moving through the port. The largest impact on growth this fiscal year is the distribution of petroleum products going to Mexico and within the region and an increase in agricultural fertilizer.

“Fuel constitutes a major portion of our total tonnage and has made a significant impact on the Port’s growth” Port Director Walker Smith said. “However that growth is also making headway to allow us to diversify our capabilities of what we can bring into the area.”

Along with refined petroleum products The Port of Harlingen also transports aggregates; liquid fertilizer; dry fertilizer; agricultural products including grains cotton cottonseed and distiller’s dried grains with solubles; and raw sugar.

“Unfortunately during harvest the Cassava was affected by mosaic disease and I could not even make any sale out of it. I was only eventually able to make garri for my immediate family consumption out of the very few tubers I was able to salvage from the loss” Modu told FIJ.

Knowing he was close to the deadline of the loan repayment Modu called the company to beg for an extension of the deadline.

Message sent to Modu’s contacts

“Despite the explanation I gave to the agent about what happened to my produce she said I was lying and that I should pay the money immediately or they would deal with me” he said.

“I was frightened having heard that they usually send messages to people’s contacts to defame them. So I spoke to friends but no one was able to help.”

A few days after the deadline his contacts received messages from LCredit stating that he borrowed a loan and it was now overdue.

“After bearing the shame for days from family and friends who were contacts on my phone I made up my mind never to pay back a penny. They have done their worst already.”

But Modu would continue to get calls from the agents of the company.

“One Saturday their call came in as my son was playing a game on my phone. He innocently answered it and later handed the phone to me. When I saw that it was from LCredit I hissed and wanted to end the call but my wife encouraged me to hear what they had to say” he said.

“A lady said she was calling to remind me that I was still owing them. In anger I told her I was no longer willing to pay back a penny considering the humiliation I suffered in their hands.

Chat from another Lcredit agent to a debtor

“She apologised for the action stating that most of the messages the company send out are as a result of the level of pressure they get from their Chinese owners when it comes to loan recovery. She said ‘The pressure we get from our Chinese owners forces us to defame our debtors’.

“She also told me that their Chinese bosses don’t care about the means of recovery. All they care about is the result. If you can’t recover the money it will affect your employment status.

“Because of the polite way she spoke to me I have changed my mind. I will pay back the money but the repayment will only happen when I have the money. I won’t be pressured to pay it back. Not anymore.”

Findings revealed that LCredit is actually run by Cashigo International Ltd. a Lagos-based company headed by Yun Tao Cong a Chinese national.

FIJ also found that iMoney Xcredit and OKash other leading quick credit outfits in Nigeria are also run by Chinese owners.

FIJ recently reported how a quick loan outfit announced the obituary of its debtor despite a recent statement by the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) announcing the commencement of an investigation into privacy rights violations in the money-lending industry.

By Anna J. Park



Ahead of LG Energy Solution's massive IPO slated later this month the huge size of the global battery manufacturer is drawing towards it liquidity from around the local stock market as institutional investors are readjusting their investment portfolios to include the soon-to-be listed company.



While the battery company is set to receive retail investors' subscriptions for the IPO for two days this Tuesday and Wednesday the firm's institutional investor subscriptions have resulted in an all-time record high ― the competition rate of 2023:1 ― in the history of KOSPI-listed companies with orders standing at a whopping 15.2 quadrillion won ($12 trillion) worth of stocks.



Although the firm's market cap size based on the subscription price is around 70 trillion won its market cap is expected to reach some 100 trillion won given the success of the IPO subscription rate.



The company is also expected to be included in various major global indices such as the FTSE MSCI and KOSPI 200 which will also draw a massive influx of passive fund money. This passive funds influx is expected to add fuel to the already-overheated demand for the stock acting as yet more pressure towards the stock's upward movement in a short-term period.



In response to such fervor major local institutional investors have been preparing their cash bullets to purchase the LGES stock by selling local stocks. Since the end of last year institutional investors net-sold over nine trillion won worth of local stocks ― 7.2 trillion won on the KOSPI market and 2.1 trillion won on the tech-heavy KOSDAQ market during the first two weeks of this month leading the downward trend shown in the local stock markets early this year.



During the period the KOSPI index fell by 3.26 percent and the KOSDAQ index declined by 5.46 percent which canceled out a ""January Effect"" ― a general stock market trend that shows a bullish run in the first month of a year.



Institutional investors' most net-sold stock item is Samsung Electronics the country's largest market cap company followed by SK hynix Naver Kakao Celltrion Krafton and LG Chem most of which are representative blue-chip companies.



Once completing the public offering LGES is expected to be one of the top three market cap companies on the KOSPI.



""In the short term LGES is expected to function as a 'black hole' which puts constraints on other large market cap companies included in the KOSPI 200 index"" Kim Yong-koo an analyst at Samsung Securities said explaining that institutional investors' recent selling spree through their program trading is mostly aimed at securing LGES stocks.



Concerns over rising interest rates in major countries are another factor along with the burden of the LGES IPO putting downward pressure on the local stock market and limiting stock prices.

He became prominent as the UK’s top-rated banking analyst throughout the 1980s.Smith is now best known for his hugely successful career as a fund manager having set up Fundsmith and managed its flagship Fundsmith Equity Fund since its inception in November 2010. The fund has become the most popular open-ended actively managed fund based in the UK.The fund has delivered an annualized return of 18.4 per cent between inception and the end of November 2021 far outstripping the MSCI World index which has a comparative annualized return of 12.8 per cent.In his book ""Investing For Growth"" Smith discusses investing lessons he learnt from the annual men's multiple-stage bicycle race ""Tour de France"".According to Smith investors have the knack of examining their portfolio performance in every reporting period as often as every quarter and sometimes exiting the stocks which underperform.He says it's as pointless to expect an investment strategy or a fund manager to outperform the market in all reporting periods and varying market conditions as expecting to find a rider who can win every stage of the Tour.He says investment performance has to be measured over some time period and a quarter is too short a period to judge performance reasonably.""To assess an investment strategy or a fund you need to see its results across a full economic cycle with both bull and bear markets"" he writes in his book.According to Smith any strategies which rely upon an element of market timing are the ones to be avoided.He says there is a lot of evidence to suggest that those investors who like to switch and change investment strategies invariably get the market timing wrong.""As the old saying goes there are only two types of investor: those who can’t time the markets and those who don’t know they can’t time the markets"" he says.According to Smith investment is a test of the endurance of investors and the winners are the ones who find a good strategy or fund and stick with it.Smith says investors should have a high quality concentrated portfolio of 20-30 resilient global growth companies which are held for the long term.As per him investors should follow a simple three-step investment strategy which is-1. Buy good companies2. Don't overpay3. Do nothingSmith shared some of the secrets of his success and key investing principles in his book. Let's look at some of them-Smith says that investors should look to invest in companies that break the rule of mean reversion that states returns must revert to the average as new capital is attracted to business activities earning supernormal returns.According to Smith investors should find companies with brand names high market shares patents licenses distribution networks installed bases and client relationships as together these define a company’s franchise and its ability to outperform competitors.“We seek to invest in businesses whose assets are intangible and difficult to replicate"" he says.According to Smith in order to gain superior returns it is not enough for companies to earn a high unlevered rate of return.He says investors should try to find businesses with a high degree of certainty of growth from reinvestment of their cash flows at high rates of return.""The businesses we seek must have growth potential. Our definition of growth is that they must also be able to reinvest at least a portion of their excess cash flow back into the business to grow while generating a high return on the cash thus reinvested"" he said.Smith says investors should invest in companies that earn a high return on their capital on an unleveraged basis in recognition that sometimes credit is withdrawn.According to Smith investors should avoid investing in industries which are exposed to rapid technological innovation and therefore obsolescence. This approach renders many sectors uninvestable.Smith says the ideal holding period for a good investment should be indefinite which means investors should hold the stocks in their investment portfolio for a long time.Smith says investors should try to avoid timing the market as it can lead to huge unnecessary losses.Smith says without deploying a consistent high-conviction approach over time it is hard for any investor to beat the benchmark for their target sector.According to Smith too many investment managers have abandoned focused stock picking. He says investors should pick great businesses for investment with high conviction.“Investors are their own worst enemy.” He says the average equity fund investor significantly underperforms the average equity fund due to their tendency to buy funds at the top and sell them at the bottom of market cycles.Smith's timeless lessons can help investors understand the importance of rational and emotionally disciplined investing where often the best course of action is to do nothing.From Smith's investing principles it is easy to see why he has found so much success in the investment world. If investors follow these investing tips it can be very beneficial for them to achieve superior returns in the long run.(Disclaimer: This article is based on Terry Smith's book ""Investing For Growth"")",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzdGVjaC5jby56YS9uZXdzL3Byb3BlcnR5LzU0OTU5OC93aGF0LXRvLWV4cGVjdC1mcm9tLXRoZS1wcm9wZXJ0eS1pbmR1c3RyeS1pbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtaW4tMjAyMi1pbmNsdWRpbmctY29udGludWVkLXNlbWlncmF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What to expect from the property industry in South Africa in 2022 including continued semigration,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://businesstech.co.za/news/property/549598/what-to-expect-from-the-property-industry-in-south-africa-in-2022-including-continued-semigration/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzdGVjaC5jby56YS9uZXdzL3Byb3BlcnR5LzU0OTU5OC93aGF0LXRvLWV4cGVjdC1mcm9tLXRoZS1wcm9wZXJ0eS1pbmR1c3RyeS1pbi1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtaW4tMjAyMi1pbmNsdWRpbmctY29udGludWVkLXNlbWlncmF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

{% sfr %}

Brian Withers: Atlassian. TEAM is the ticker. They were just named a leader by Forrester (NASDAQ:FORR) for its enterprise service management tools. These tools are in the same zone as ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). ServiceNow is in the leader zone as well. ServiceNow was actually founded and focused on this product and customer set. This is great news for Atlassian shareholders and a recognition that its move into the IT service management space is paying off. In its investor meeting over a year ago the company laid out three pillars which was focused on first agile development tools for software engineers which is where the company started. Work management and it calls it for all for non-tech and technical and this IT service management which is a natural extension of its work in the software engineering teams. Today 35000 customers depend on Jira service management for their product support needs. A quote from the press release ""Atlassian received the highest possible scores in 18 of the 22 evaluation criteria. The report list usability ecosystem Atlassian Suite integrations as its greater strength noting that Atlassian is a good fit for organizations looking for a comprehensively integrated service management platform to bring together development operations and business teams."" I love that this company's products are being recognized as exceptional especially in this new area for growth.

Toby Bordelon: Brian I looked at the stock chart over the past year. Atlassian hasn't gotten crushed as much as some of the other SaaS companies have. Stock's down over time for sure but it's not as much as you might think given the gloom and doom we hear about tech companies SaaS and general financial media. My question for you is what makes Atlassian different and why has it held up better? Can it continue to do so?

Withers: That's a great insight Toby. The stock actually is up if you look over the last 12 months 41% but it's down as well with other tech companies 25% from its high. I think it's different because of its broad range of products. For instance it competes with Asana (NYSE:ASAN) for work management. It competes with ServiceNow on IT service management and it competes with tools like JFrog (NASDAQ:FROG) for code release. Why have three different companies with three different focuses when you can consolidate as a customer all of these street functions with Atlassian tools? In fact Forrester recognized this in their report and said Atlassian's strategy centers around a comprehensive digital product pipeline coupled with an effective land and expand customer acquisition model. This strategy receives the strongest score in this evaluation. That's what I really like about it its umbrella of services and products.

It's up roughly sixfold over the past 24 months and many times more over its lifetime.

Bitcoin's market cap has ballooned to roughly $820 billion more than a third of all value among cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's rate of appreciation may slow down at this large size making a bear market possible for Bitcoin in 2022 if investors cool off toward it.

Meanwhile technology is creating value in the broader cryptocurrency space including data analytics company Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) launching Foundry for Crypto. While Bitcoin's track record of gains is impressive Palantir's stock could outpace Bitcoin in 2022. Here's why.

Is Bitcoin due for a soft year?

Bitcoin is up more than 29800% over its lifetime showing just how ridiculously good of an investment it's been for early investors. The price has continued multiplying up by roughly six times over the past two years but just 20% over the past 12 months.

Bitcoin is currently down after setting an all-time high in late 2021. To be sure nobody can predict the price action of cryptocurrencies. But Bitcoin doesn't have earnings or free cash flow like stocks do which can be a compass of sorts for valuing them. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are mainly a function of supply and demand.

Suppose investors begin shying away from ""buying the dip"" because of Bitcoin's negative price momentum. In that case investors could see a soft 2022 for it and other cryptos especially after the massive price action seen from 2020 and 2021.

Foundry for Crypto can help the industry

Cryptocurrencies have become popular for several reasons; they operate on blockchain technology a type of ledger that publicly tracks each transaction as an ongoing chain so that people can't change it.

Blockchain technology means that cryptocurrencies are decentralized; they aren't managed by a single party like how the government controls the U.S. dollar. The unregulated nature of cryptocurrency is a plus for many crypto investors but there could be hurdles that slow down how decentralized currencies are adopted by society.

For example the cryptocurrency space has become a Wild West of sorts where scams are rampant and coin ""pump and dump"" schemes typically leave investors with losses after the founders abandon the project once they make money.

Palantir's Foundry is a software-as-a-service data platform that interacts with data to help users make actionable decisions. It can integrate data perform analytics build models map and track decision-making. It's almost like Iron Man's power armor; it doesn't function by itself but it makes a superhero when combined with the user.

Palantir launched Foundry for Crypto to gain exposure to the growth of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. Foundry for Crypto lists offerings including anti-money laundering fraud detection intelligence for decentralized applications and analytics across blockchains. It's still very early and Palantir will need to elaborate on the program's progress over the coming quarters and years. Still Foundry could prove a valuable tool in a space where security and regulation are lacking. Cryptocurrency is still speculative but some estimate that it could grow into an enormous field which could be a massive opportunity for Palantir over the long term.

Why Palantir could soar in 2022

Bitcoin isn't the only asset coming down from a big run; Palantir's stock has struggled too amid a marketwide sell-off of tech stocks. Shares are currently near 52-week lows falling from $45 per share to under $17.

Palantir's price-to-sales ratio has declined on a forward basis from nearly 48 to under 17 because the company's revenue keeps growing while the share price drops. Meanwhile free cash flow has turned positive over the past year a great sign that the business is on a path to profitability. Adjusted free cash flow was $119 million in Palantir's most recent reporting period the third quarter of 2021 up from a negative $53 million in 2020.

The stock's reduced valuation could be a great buying opportunity as the business is turning a corner producing free cash flow. Management has maintained a long-term revenue growth projection of at least 30% per year over the next four years.

If the market begins favoring fast-growing companies again Palantir's improving financials and signs of continued growth in future quarters could make it a big winner in 2022.

The current tensions have ratcheted upward due to the advent of the streaming wars and the new business models the deep-pocketed players have developed. While Disney recently settled a compensation spat out of court with actor Scarlett Johansson after shifting her starring vehicle “Black Widow” out of theaters and onto its platform within days the Writers Guild won a wider victory over the talent agencies last year phasing out packaging fees and cutting agency interest stakes in affiliated production companies to just 20% going forward.

Attention around the means of rewarding talent further spiked thanks to a modestly priced South Korean series that stormed the world last fall with an initial 142 million viewers for Netflix (and still counting): “Squid Game.”

Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk when confronted with the leaked $891 million Netflix-generated revenue metric laughed: “I’m not that rich. It’s not like Netflix are paying me a bonus.” Hwang is now being happily rewarded with a second series — no doubt armed with a bigger budget (and therefore higher fees etc.) than the original’s $21.4 million price tag.

Popular on Variety

The hot industry topic right now is over frontend and backend remuneration including how an array of definitions ranging from gross and adjusted gross points net profit points royalties residuals and control and ownership of copyright and associated underlying intellectual property rights are being played out (or indeed ridden over) given the surge of deep-pocketed streamers. The stakes are colossal: Pre-pandemic the global content industry was valued at around $70 billion; now the streamers are chasing 2 billion subscribers in a market worth more than $140 billion in 2022 alone.

The debate is also in the throes of becoming politically charged far beyond the shores of Hollywood given the long arm of the E.U.’s Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) which governs E.U.-wide coordination of national legislation on all audio-visual media and the French industry’s regulatory position over streaming platforms’ terms of trade which is entering its final stages of negotiation.

“We’re dealing with three worlds” says Peter Klass of Hollywood accountants GHJ Advisers. “There’s the transactional performance-driven model that studios have used to reward talent; then there’s the post-cash break-even net profit split for indie titles. But what is the upside offered to talent in the streaming model? Titles never leave a platform if they’ve been commissioned and are owned by that platform. There’s no upside down the line.”

Klass argues that the streaming model is now a high- volume business “that is tending to hit a lot of singles but there’s almost no chance of home runs. But even with hits talent is not getting life-changing compensation anymore. Streamers are buying out participation by slightly overpaying everyone. Studio post-cash break [even] participations aren’t worth anything anymore in real terms save for a few outliers and first-dollar grosses are gone. It’s a slightly better model for film if the costs are controlled than TV or episodic content. There’s more long-term upside but only if you are still controlling or influencing the revenue streams.”

Dissecting Klass’ three sectors more closely it is timely to recall Schuyler Moore’s concluding statements on contingent payments — such as deferred cash payments for rights or services or gross or net profit participation — to talent and licensors in his book “The Biz.” Moore Greenberg Glusker entertainment law partner says “the amusing aspect of the participations process is that film companies by gradually making the concept of contingent compensation almost meaningless have shot themselves in the foot. What used to be a valid and necessary means for spreading risk in a risky industry is now discounted as a joke. The result is that talent demands money upfront or a gross participation … film companies would be far better served if they return to a realistic and fair approach to contingent compensation which would result in a drastic reduction in fixed film costs and the spreading of risk. Participations would be paid on successful films where it can be afforded and unsuccessful films would not be the devastating blows that they are today.”

Today’s irony is that the streamers mindful of the intensely competitive market for talent and high-end packages have been paying “premiums” typically somewhere between 10% and 20% when fully funding while taking the backend off the table. The premium is eaten into by financing costs given the streamers’ oft-delayed payment terms to producers unless the producers are fully cash flowing. It’s also preyed upon by agents ever eager to place their clients (including actors and directors but rarely writers and producers) higher up the payment waterfall. Observers warn that talent and their representation should be careful what they wish for. Sylvester Stallone’s pugnacious demand: “I want mine now!” has to an extent been taken literally by the streamers who are effectively squaring off the backend (and acquiring the underlying IP in perpetuity wherever possible arguably mirroring the studios’ IP demands over decades) in return for more money upfront.

That won’t last. As Matt Brodlie former Disney Plus and Netflix executive and now a co-president of Upgrade Prods. points out: “The streamers are very aware that they are wasting a lot of money by paying upfront as most movies are not financially successful and yet they are paying out as if everything is a hit. That’s not a good business model but how do they fix this without revealing too much of their internal business? It’s a big internal debate right now.”

Many lawyers managers and agents consulted had no beef with the premium trade off. “For us it’s great. They pay upfront and can’t cheat you to hell” says Moore. “You can’t tie a film’s performance to subscriber metrics. It’s too hard to glom onto a subscription model. This won’t change until there’s a serious shake out.”

Agents outside Hollywood concur: “I’d always prefer to go for the money up front. Net profits are like a hypothetical insurance but 99.5% of the time you don’t get them” says Julian Friedmann chair of London literary agency Blake Friedmann.

International producers with long memories are mindful of the challenges of indie financing appreciating the money upfront.

“You need to be somewhat zen-like” says Number 9’s Stephen Woolley. “You’re well-paid up front and get nothing later. The rare phenomenon of a hit is the only downside. And a lot of people are benefitting from streaming in other ways: cherished projects that have been in development for anything from five to 15 years are now getting made.”

Others are more equivocal about the binary-like terms on offer. Veteran producer-financier Christopher Tuffin who is launching an international sales finance and production company at the top of the new year in partnership with several of the largest non-studio distributors around the world believes in a more nuanced approach when choosing the right home for a project. “If you’re non-entrepreneurial and looking to get as much up front as possible and nonplussed by algo-rithms and moral certitude then the streamers offer a safe reliable ecosystem to thrive within governed by some of the most talented executives in the game. However if you’re looking to build wealth and/or explore boundless storytelling then working with a streamer would be akin to creative sharecropping. You don’t own the land or even decide what is grown on it you just get to eat off it.”

Hungry creative talent relegated to a position of “for hire” is a deeply perplexing development to senior industry players who have watched aghast at the erosion of rights and revenues: “We are experiencing the ‘Uberfication’ of the industry” says Oscar-nominated writer and producer James Schamus. “The new eco-system with a distribution network that is now financ-ing producing and distributing belies a fundamental political battle between labor and capital. It’s not about intervention and regulating. That won’t be enough. It’s about breaking it up but is the political will there?

“From a U.S. talent perspective there is a cascade of consequences in play across the spectrum from major talent to workers” he continues. “First there has been a convergence in negotiation between top-line talent and the studios which has resulted in the elimination of participation in

the downstream value of our work in return for upfront so-called ‘premiums.’ This has hollowed out the traditional framework for residuals that have been hard won by unions through collective bargaining.”

Schamus points to the indie model’s structure for sharing success. Money up front transfers net revenues away from any waterfall under the indie Collection Account Management Agreement (CAMA) structure and the subsequent sharing between not just the producer and talent but also the financiers: “Now in return for an upfront fee talent across the board is saying goodbye to sharing profits. The challenge is that we are [facing] a system where the efforts of the creatives and the calculation of value added by their content is tricky. How do you work out how a particular movie or show contributed to the stock price since there are no longer traditional metrics once used as proxies to account some sort of value — whether box office grosses or Nielsen ratings? That’s why I think we’re in danger of being ‘Uberfied’ in the film and TV business. Rideshare drivers get virtually nothing now even as costs for riders have increased because the corporations running the apps have effectively monopolized their markets.”

Schamus is far from alone in his concerns. “Think about this: As a writer of novels of plays of musicals I own my copyright but I don’t as a screenwriter” says showrunner and producer James A. Duff (“The Closer” “Major Crimes”). ”We are highly paid servants. Producers may be thrilled to not rock the boat but they will be struggling with the long-term consequences. We all should think of who comes after us.”

And not all talent is equal. “It’s OK for the top 2% — leading showrunners and so on — to be paid big premiums but the other 98% are facing a very different set of rewards” says Nick Marston chair of literary agent Curtis Brown.

There’s also another area impacted by streamers says John Sloss of the sales and advisory firm Cinetic Media: “The nature of content with the streaming model has changed the value of rights. The streamers are less deep library players — content is not that valuable after a few years — so rather than negotiating for back-end you may be better off using whatever leverage you have to limit the license term. The streamers should be more willing to share data as they’re largely from the tech industry which prizes transparency. The next five years is going to be the most competitive period so maybe it makes sense for a group of reps to encourage one of the streamers to break the unwritten rules and agree to a performance-based metric as a basis for back-end.”

Supporting the concept of sharing the spoils and rewarding success one of the leading talent agents who talked off the record says “It seems inevitable that a streamer will pursue this strategy given the fierce competition for filmmakers creators and projects. Furthermore the new buyers seem less preoccupied with traditional studio precedents and tend to be more comfortable with disruptive dealmaking as it suits them to gain market position. We’re likely to see experimentation with compensation models moving forward as streamers continue to develop their internal metrics for success and solidify their philosophies for how best to compete for talent and consumers.”

The agent adds that “although we continue to see significant upfront payments the lack of a success-based model is an ongoing challenge … particularly for artists who don’t have leverage at the initial point of creation. In some cases you can make up the difference through renegotiations for subsequent seasons sequels etc. but it doesn’t address the loss of traditional studio backends.”

But right now the status quo is akin to a land grab with agents and reps focused on the feeding frenzy the table offers upfront right now.

“People are caught up with the notion that a streamer deal is going to be super profitable so they try to build in clauses for talent to that effect if and when such a deal comes about” says Moore. “It does not change anything and the money from any deal should simply go into the pot and be shared as part of the profits.”

Sloss concurs convinced that if a film sells down the line “there’s no reason why those monies should not go into the CAMA and be shared as per the contracts.”

Not all producers are happy with the upfront-only model. “Taking away success and a potential payday runs against the psychology of producing because we’re essentially gamblers” says Good Gate Media’s John Giwa-Amu an award-winning Welsh-based company in Blighty. “As an entrepreneur I’d prefer the chance to win big with harder odds than work for hire for a flat wage. Also I’d still be working on my own rather than with my team right now if it wasn’t for the fact that I get a fat tail of payments down the line from royalties which in turn help build my business.”

Other leading European executives agree. “We need a system that rewards success” says Banijay’s head of scripted Lars Blomgren. “A lot of streaming services seem to be about a high-volume of content driving new commissions. For us we’re an IP-driven company which we create and control and we want to be able to live from it. The streaming model is a challenge — sometimes we can justify working for hire if the premiums are good enough but it’s not our preferred business model.

“For us it’s a question of incentivizing producers and the talent which if done effectively makes a huge difference to the whole system and the quality of the productions.”

One of the key issues at stake that a veteran international trade broker who requested anonymity is perplexed about is the streamers’ approach to producers equity in development. “The lack of bargaining power in the turnaround provisions of current negotiations is acute. Consider the independent producer’s equity in time and financial investment it takes to build and package a project including a bible visuals key attachments screenplay [or at least pilot draft for a series] and you have to question whether producers and writers are recouping their development costs in full and really getting a premium for that investment on set up and execution?”

The agent likewise identifies with the challenges facing indie producers in today’s fast changing market: “It’s incredibly difficult to be an independent producer right now. Historically there was more overhead available for term deals which would provide financial stability for producers. The buyers seem to have reallocated that money towards other areas of focus. Beyond that it’s incredibly difficult to achieve the type of outlier success — financial or even in terms of perception — that allowed producers of the past years in film to brand themselves as destinations for projects and future opportunity.”

With the notable exception of France few territories have an answer. Philippe Carcassonne prolific Paris-based producer points out that the French can finance from their own public funding support system.

“My current 13-year-old company has produced roughly 20 films generating several millions of euros in reference funds [aka government backing for producers via Fonds Soutien]. Of course they’re not all due to the producer — but on average 25% to 50% [depending whether we’re several co-producers sharing or not] do flow back my way allowing me to develop control and retain rights and offering a fundamental advantage. Add in the protection over two TV airings and the rights returning to the French producers as a general business standard and we’re working on a different playing field.”

Indeed as Paris-based Duff points out in a concluding note “None of the streamers have suggested renting the copyright for a few years and then reupping if they want to keep the show. There will be no big payouts like ‘Friends’ or ‘Seinfeld’ ever again unless we develop a new way in which to keep platforms from exploiting their positions of power to own and distribute the creative work of their collaborative artists. We cannot count on the platforms to do the right thing. We will have to demand that they do the right thing.”

This week a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against Netflix brought by a grieving father who said the TV show ""13 Reasons Why"" was to blame for his 15-year-old daughter's death by suicide in April 2017.

But John Herndon of Livermore California plans to appeal the decision he said during an interview with Insider.

""We disagree with the district court's decision and we do intend to appeal"" he said. ""We appreciate the district court's consideration of the issue.""

Herndon has accused Netflix of using sophisticated algorithms to ""target highly vulnerable children"" including his daughter Bella and alleges that kids were ""directly manipulated"" into watching dangerous content court documents show.

Netflix disputes this saying in court filings that restrictions on programming would result in self-censorship.

'This is a tragic case'

Bella Herndon was a 15-year-old girl who loved writing short stories reading voraciously about Greek mythology and spending time with her family and tight-knit group of friends.

""She was very intelligent inquisitive and very quick"" her father told Insider. ""She and I were like best buddies.""

When Bella died by suicide in April 2017 he said it came ""completely out of the blue"" and was a ""total surprise"" to their family. Bella had been seeing a therapist who had advised him that everything was looking ""very well"" Herndon added.

It was only on the day of her funeral he said that he became aware that she had been watching Netflix's ""13 Reasons Why"" — a controversial teen drama that revolved around the suicide of the main character Hannah Baker.

Bella's school friends approached the late teenager's father in the church and explained that she watched the show in her final days. ""I had no idea"" Herndon said. ""The kids were extremely open and honest about how they felt about it and how they believed that it affected Bella.""

Herndon concluded that Bella had died ""as a result of the tortious acts and omissions of Netflix that caused or at least substantially contributed to her suicide"" according to a class-action lawsuit filed in August.

""This is a tragic case"" US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said on Tuesday per The Hollywood Reporter. ""But ultimately I don't think that it survives.""

Insider reached out to Netflix for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

The show was accused of glorifying suicide

The teen drama which ran for four seasons between 2017 and 2020 was accused by critics and mental-health professionals of glorifying suicide.

""13 Reasons Why"" based on a book of the same name originally (and controversially) included a graphic three-minute suicide scene in the last episode of season one.

""The show before Netflix modified the content gave a very detailed walkthrough of how this girl went about committing suicide"" Herndon said. ""The way that she did it was particularly abhorrent to me as a father and as a reasonable person.""

In July 2019 Netflix edited the scene out.

""But it was too late — the damage had already been done"" Herndon told Insider. ""All of the medical research that we've looked at so far has just pointed to the fact that this is not content that you would show to a young audience.""

A 2019 study found that teen suicides increased in the months after the show first aired.

Herndon maintains that what he alleges Netflix did is immoral. ""As parents we do everything every single day to teach our kids the difference between right and wrong"" he said.

""I think this show and there are others like it are the complete antithesis to the moral rules and laws that we were all raised to understand.""

Herndon said he would continue to speak up about what happened to his daughter in the hope of raising awareness about the dangers of harmful content promoted to children.

""All of this is to bring to the attention of the world that this kind of activity is something as parents and as a society that we need to address."""

The change comes as the Corps overhauls its manpower and retention policies in order to improve retention and create an older smarter force.

On the enlisted side prospective new Marines currently are given a list of contracts they qualify for primarily based on armed services vocational aptitude battery or ASVAB scores.

While many can become Marines with a good enough physical test and ASVAB score the actual job they get is based more on when they happened to ship to boot camp than on actual aptitude.

In 2022 the Marine Corps will give recruits a wider variety of tests better outline who is likely to make it through boot camp and who is most likely to have a long successful Marine Corps career.

Though the rollout will begin in 2022 it likely will not be fully operational until 2024 Maj. Bob Jankowski with Marine Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs told reporters Nov. 22 2021.

“Better aligning Marines to an (military occupational specialty) that aligns with both their interests and abilities will have positive impacts on retention” Jankowski said.

The Marine Corps is still working out how to best implement the tool on the enlisted side. It likely will be a hybrid method that sees some Marines sign an umbrella contract while others sign a job specific one.

Officers also will take extra tests that will be used to guide them through their preference ranking at The Basic School.

The new officers will have a chance to discuss the results to ensure they are ranking their preferences based on their strengths and desires.

“We’re actually given them an opportunity to have a best fit for them in the assignment where they would be happier” Bohm said. “And if you’re happier in your assignment not just doing what dad told you to do or because you didn’t know any better but something you’re actually best suited for and would be happier doing that’s going to help our retention efforts as well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvZGF2aWQtc3BhZGUtaXMtc2VsbGluZy1oaXMtbG9uZ3RpbWUtc3dhbmt5LWxhLWhvbWUtZm9yLTI3NS1taWxsaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Spade is selling his long-time swanky LA home for $27.5 million - realestate.com.au,"David Spade is saying goodbye to his longtime Beverly Hills home which he has lived in for two decades.

This becomes relevant as pharmaceutical companies are driving responses to Covid-19 which until now have endangered public health rather than optimizing it. The traditional media have been complicit willing to spread their propaganda a false official narrative that leads the public astray and fosters fear based on lies.

BlackRock and Vanguard form a secret monopoly that also owns just about everything they can think of. In total they own 1600 U.S. companies which in 2015 had combined revenues of $ 9.1 billion. When you add the third-largest global owner State Street their combined ownership encompasses nearly 90% of all S&P 500 firms.

Vanguard is the largest shareholder in BlackRock. Vanguard itself on the other hand has a unique structure that makes its property more difficult to discern but many of the oldest and richest families in the world can be linked to Vanguard funds.

What do The New York Times and most other legacy outlets have in common with Big Pharma? Answer: They are largely owned by BlackRock and Vanguard Group the two largest asset management firms in the world. Furthermore it turns out that these two companies form a secret monopoly that also owns just about everything you can think of.

“The shares of the largest corporations in the world belong to the same institutional investors. They all own each other. This means that “competing” brands such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi are not competitors since their shares belong to exactly the same investment companies mutual funds insurance companies banks and in some cases governments … Smaller investors are owned by larger investors.

The visible top of this pyramid shows only two companies whose names we have seen often: Vanguard and BlackRock… The power of these two companies is beyond your imagination. Not only do they own a large portion of the stocks but also the shares of investors in those companies. This gives them a complete monopoly… A report by Bloomberg affirms that both companies in the year 2028 together will have investments amounting to US $ 20000 million. That means they own almost everything.”

Who are the Vanguards



The word “vanguard” means “the leading position in an army or fleet advancing into battle” and “the leading position in a trend or movement.” Both are apt descriptions of this world behemoth owned by globalists pushing for a Great Reset the core of which is the transfer of wealth and property from the hands of the majority to the hands of the very few.

Interestingly Vanguard is the largest shareholder in BlackRock (March 2021). Vanguard itself on the other hand has a “unique” corporate structure that makes its ownership more difficult to discern. It is owned by its various funds which in turn are owned by shareholders. Apart from these shareholders it has no outside investors and is not listed on the stock market.

“The elite that owns Vanguard apparently don’t like being the center of attention but of course they can’t hide from who’s willing to dig. Oxfam and Bloomberg reports say that 1% of the world together owns more money than the other 99%. Worse still Oxfam says that 82% of all money earned in 2017 went to this 1%…. In other words these two investment companies Vanguard and BlackRock have a monopoly on all the industries in the world and in turn belong to the richest families in the world some of whom are royalty and who have been very rich since before the Industrial Revolution”.

While it would take time to sift through all Vanguard funds to identify individual shareholders and therefore Vanguard owners a quick look suggests that Rothschild Investment Corp. and Edmond De Rothschild Holding are two such stakeholders. Keep the Rothschild name in mind as you read as it will appear again later.

The Italian Orsini family the American Bush family the British royal family the Du Pont family the Morgans Vanderbilts and Rockefellers are identified as owners of Vanguard.

BlackRock and Vanguard own Big Pharma



According to Simply Wall Street as of February 2020 BlackRock and Vanguard were the two largest shareholders in GlaxoSmithKline holding 7% and 3.5% of the shares respectively. At Pfizer the ownership is invested with Vanguard being the largest investor and BlackRock the second largest shareholder.

Keep in mind that stock ownership indices can change at any time as companies buy and sell on a regular basis so don’t get hung up on percentages. The bottom line is that BlackRock and Vanguard individually and combined own enough stock at any given time that we can easily say that they easily control both Big Pharma and centralized legacy media and more.

It matters because pharmaceutical companies are driving responses to Covid-19 all of which so far have endangered public health rather than optimizing it and traditional media outlets have been complicit willing to spread their propaganda an Official false narrative that has and still is misleading audiences and fostering fear based on lies.

To have any chance of correcting this we must understand who the central actors are where the damaging dictates are coming from and why these false narratives are being created in the first place.

As noted in Global Justice Now’s December 2020 report “Big Pharma’s Horrifying Story” we simply cannot allow pharmaceutical companies “which have a long history of prioritizing corporate profits over corporate health. people” continue to dictate Covid-19 responses.

In it they review the shameful history of the world’s top seven pharmaceutical companies that are now developing and manufacturing gene-based drugs and “vaccines” against Covid-19 while the mainstream media has helped suppress information on older drugs. readily available that have been shown to be highly effective against infection.

BlackRock and Vanguard own the media



When it comes to The New York Times in May 2021 BlackRock is the second largest shareholder with 7.43% of total shares just after The Vanguard Group which owns the largest share (8.11%).

In addition to The New York Times Vanguard and BlackRock are also the two main owners of Time Warner Comcast Disney and News Corp four of the six media companies that control more than 90% of the US media landscape.

It goes without saying that if you are in control of so many media outlets you can control entire nations through carefully orchestrated and organized centralized propaganda disguised as journalism.

BlackRock and Vanguard together form a hidden monopoly on global asset holding and through their influence over centralized media have the power to manipulate and control a large part of the world’s economy and events and how the world sees everything.

Given that BlackRock announced in 2018 that it has “societal expectations” of the companies it invests in its potential role as a lynchpin in the Great Reboot and “build back better” plan cannot be overlooked.

This information demonstrates how competition is “undermined by owning shares in competing companies” and “blurs the lines between private equity and government affairs by working closely with regulators” and it would be hard not to see how BlackRock and Vanguard facilitate the Big Reboot and the so-called “green” revolution both of which are part of the same wealth theft scheme.



BlackRock and Vanguard own the world



That claim will be even clearer once you realize that this duo’s influence is not limited to Big Pharma and the media. Importantly BlackRock also works closely with central banks around the world including the United States Federal Reserve which is a private not a federal entity. It lends money to the Central Bank acts as an advisor to the Central Bank and develops the Central Bank software.

BlackRock and Vanguard also own shares in a long list of other companies including Microsoft Apple Amazon Facebook and Alphabet Inc. From 2017’s “These Three Companies Own America” ​​on The Conversation it would be nearly impossible to list them all.

A global monopoly few know about



How can we link BlackRock and Vanguard and the globalist families that own them to the Great Reboot? Barring a public confession we have to analyze the relationships between these gigantic globalist-owned corporations and consider the influence they can exert through those relationships. As Lew Rockwell noted: “When Rothschild’s Lynn Forester wants the United States to be a one-party country (like China) and does not want voter identification laws passed in the United States so that more electoral fraud can be perpetrated to achieve that end.

What do they do?



Forester holds a conference call with the world’s top 100 CEOs and tells them to publicly denounce the passage of Georgia’s anti-corruption law as ‘Jim Crow’ and order his obedient CEOs to boycott the state of Georgia as we saw with Coca- Cola and Major League Baseball and even Hollywood star Will Smith… In this conference call we see shadows of the Great Reset the 2030 Agenda the New World Order.

The UN wants to make sure like [World Economic Forum founder and CEO Klaus] Schwab that by 2030 poverty hunger pollution and disease no longer plague the Earth… To achieve this The UN wants the taxes of western countries to be divided by the elite mega-corporations to create a completely new society. For this project the UN says we need a world government that is the UN itself. “

It seems then quite clear that the alleged solutions for the Covid-19 pandemic was orchestrated to bring about this New World Order the Great Reboot. At the center of it all is the “heart” into which all streams of global wealth flow: BlackRock and Vanguard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vd3RvbG92ZS5jb20uYXUvY2VsZWJyaXR5L2NlbGVicml0eS1uZXdzL2FiYmllLWNoYXRmaWVsZC1icm9va2UtYmx1cnRvbi1pbnN0YWdyYW0tNzA2NjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbie Chatfield reveals where she stands with Brooke Blurton after the Bachelorette refollowed her following feud,"Abbie Chatfield has weighed in on the status of her friendship with Brooke Blurton following their very public falling out.

The nine-time Australian Open winner will not be detained or deported overnight although he will be under detention this morning when he attends the office of his lawyers ahead of the hearing tomorrow morning.

Officials said the world tennis No. 1 who is unvaccinated for Covid-19 may pose a risk to the community dashing his hopes of competing for his 21st grand slam.

The cancellation means Djokovic would be barred from a new Australian visa for three years except in compelling circumstances that affect Australia’s interest.

The decision to again cancel his visa over Covid-19 entry regulations raises the prospect of a possible second court battle by the Serbian tennis star to be allowed to stay and play in the Open starting on Monday.

A source close to Djokovic’s team confirmed to Reuters that he is considering the decision and weighing his options with video yesterday purportedly showing a car – believed to be carrying the player – arriving at his lawyer’s officers.

Djokovic the Australian Open defending champion was included in the tournament’s draw on Thursday as top seed and was due to face fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic for his opening match probably on Monday or Tuesday.

The saga has intensified global debate over rights of choice for vaccines raised questions over Australia’s bungled handling of Djokovic’s visa and become a tricky issue for Prime Minister Scott Morrison as he campaigns for re-election.

Morrison said yesterday his government cancelled Djokovic’s visa to protect Australia’s hard-won gains against the Covid-19 pandemic.

‘’Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected’’ Morrison said in a statement.

Immigration Minister Alex Hawke used discretionary powers to again cancel Djokovic’s visa after a court quashed an earlier revocation and released him from immigration detention on Monday.

‘’Today I exercised my power under section 133C(3) of the Migration Act to cancel the visa held by Mr Novak Djokovic on health and good order grounds on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so’’ Hawke said in a statement.

‘’This decision followed orders by the Federal Circuit and Family Court on 10 January 2022 quashing a prior cancellation decision on procedural fairness grounds.

‘’In making this decision I carefully considered information provided to me by the Department of Home Affairs the Australian Border Force and Mr Djokovic.

‘’The Morrison Government is firmly committed to protecting Australia’s borders particularly in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic.’’

Hawke’s decision comes just three days out from the start of the Australian Open where Djokovic had hoped to become the most successful male player of all time.

It will likely result in another round of court action by the 34-year-old Serb who has already won the Open nine times and throw the grand slam tournament into further disarray.

However legal experts say it would be difficult – if not impossible – for Djokovic to successfully challenge a visa cancellation decision made personally by the Immigration Minister.

Djokovic could be held in detention in Melbourne while the Open goes on without the world’s top ranked player creating a nightmare scenario for Tennis Australia.

Protests have been predicted and the federal government can expect an international backlash in response to its decision particularly from Serbia.

Melbourne’s The Age newspaper earlier yesterday cited a source in Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s Liberal Party as saying the government was ‘’strongly leaning’’ towards revoking the visa again.

While Morrison’s government has won support at home for its tough stance on border security during the pandemic it has not escaped criticism over the botched handling of Djokovic’s visa.

The tennis star a vaccine sceptic fuelled widespread anger in Australia when he announced last week he was heading to Melbourne for the Australian Open with a medical exemption to requirements for visitors to be inoculated against Covid-19.

Australia has endured some of the world’s longest lockdowns has a 90 percent vaccination rate among adults and has seen a runaway Omicron outbreak bring nearly a million cases in the last two weeks.

Djokovic was facing mounting criticism for his actions including from other tennis players set to take part in the Australian Open next week.

Greek world number four Stefanos Tsitsipas said Djokovic was ‘’playing by his own rules’’ and making vaccinated players ‘’look like fools’’.

‘’No-one really thought they could come to Australia unvaccinated and not having to follow the protocols … it takes a lot of daring to do and putting the grand slam at risk which I don’t think many players would do’’ Tsitsipas said in an interview with India’s WION news channel.

An online poll by the News Corp media group found that 83 percent favoured the government trying to deport the tennis star.

‘’Absolutely he should go. He hasn’t done the right thing and is being a bit cheeky about it’’ said Venus Virgin Tomarz (45) who lives in Melbourne.

‘’To be honest it’s political. But if what the media are saying is true – that he didn’t come with the right paperwork – he should be treated just like everyone else’’ said Jacob Coluccio (25) who also lives in Melbourne.

‘’It should never have come to this’’ said opposition Labor leader Anthony Albanese.

‘’They have never answered the question of how is it that that visa was granted in the first place if he wasn’t eligible because he wasn’t fully vaccinated.’’"

The change comes as the Corps overhauls its manpower and retention policies in order to improve retention and create an older smarter force.

On the enlisted side prospective new Marines currently are given a list of contracts they qualify for primarily based on armed services vocational aptitude battery or ASVAB scores.

While many can become Marines with a good enough physical test and ASVAB score the actual job they get is based more on when they happened to ship to boot camp than on actual aptitude.

In 2022 the Marine Corps will give recruits a wider variety of tests better outline who is likely to make it through boot camp and who is most likely to have a long successful Marine Corps career.

Though the rollout will begin in 2022 it likely will not be fully operational until 2024 Maj. Bob Jankowski with Marine Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs told reporters Nov. 22 2021.

“Better aligning Marines to an (military occupational specialty) that aligns with both their interests and abilities will have positive impacts on retention” Jankowski said.

The Marine Corps is still working out how to best implement the tool on the enlisted side. It likely will be a hybrid method that sees some Marines sign an umbrella contract while others sign a job specific one.

Officers also will take extra tests that will be used to guide them through their preference ranking at The Basic School.

The new officers will have a chance to discuss the results to ensure they are ranking their preferences based on their strengths and desires.

“We’re actually given them an opportunity to have a best fit for them in the assignment where they would be happier” Bohm said. “And if you’re happier in your assignment not just doing what dad told you to do or because you didn’t know any better but something you’re actually best suited for and would be happier doing that’s going to help our retention efforts as well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvZGF2aWQtc3BhZGUtaXMtc2VsbGluZy1oaXMtbG9uZ3RpbWUtc3dhbmt5LWxhLWhvbWUtZm9yLTI3NS1taWxsaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Spade is selling his long-time swanky LA home for $27.5 million - realestate.com.au,"David Spade is saying goodbye to his longtime Beverly Hills home which he has lived in for two decades.

This becomes relevant as pharmaceutical companies are driving responses to Covid-19 which until now have endangered public health rather than optimizing it. The traditional media have been complicit willing to spread their propaganda a false official narrative that leads the public astray and fosters fear based on lies.

BlackRock and Vanguard form a secret monopoly that also owns just about everything they can think of. In total they own 1600 U.S. companies which in 2015 had combined revenues of $ 9.1 billion. When you add the third-largest global owner State Street their combined ownership encompasses nearly 90% of all S&P 500 firms.

Vanguard is the largest shareholder in BlackRock. Vanguard itself on the other hand has a unique structure that makes its property more difficult to discern but many of the oldest and richest families in the world can be linked to Vanguard funds.

What do The New York Times and most other legacy outlets have in common with Big Pharma? Answer: They are largely owned by BlackRock and Vanguard Group the two largest asset management firms in the world. Furthermore it turns out that these two companies form a secret monopoly that also owns just about everything you can think of.

“The shares of the largest corporations in the world belong to the same institutional investors. They all own each other. This means that “competing” brands such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi are not competitors since their shares belong to exactly the same investment companies mutual funds insurance companies banks and in some cases governments … Smaller investors are owned by larger investors.

The visible top of this pyramid shows only two companies whose names we have seen often: Vanguard and BlackRock… The power of these two companies is beyond your imagination. Not only do they own a large portion of the stocks but also the shares of investors in those companies. This gives them a complete monopoly… A report by Bloomberg affirms that both companies in the year 2028 together will have investments amounting to US $ 20000 million. That means they own almost everything.”

Who are the Vanguards



The word “vanguard” means “the leading position in an army or fleet advancing into battle” and “the leading position in a trend or movement.” Both are apt descriptions of this world behemoth owned by globalists pushing for a Great Reset the core of which is the transfer of wealth and property from the hands of the majority to the hands of the very few.

Interestingly Vanguard is the largest shareholder in BlackRock (March 2021). Vanguard itself on the other hand has a “unique” corporate structure that makes its ownership more difficult to discern. It is owned by its various funds which in turn are owned by shareholders. Apart from these shareholders it has no outside investors and is not listed on the stock market.

“The elite that owns Vanguard apparently don’t like being the center of attention but of course they can’t hide from who’s willing to dig. Oxfam and Bloomberg reports say that 1% of the world together owns more money than the other 99%. Worse still Oxfam says that 82% of all money earned in 2017 went to this 1%…. In other words these two investment companies Vanguard and BlackRock have a monopoly on all the industries in the world and in turn belong to the richest families in the world some of whom are royalty and who have been very rich since before the Industrial Revolution”.

While it would take time to sift through all Vanguard funds to identify individual shareholders and therefore Vanguard owners a quick look suggests that Rothschild Investment Corp. and Edmond De Rothschild Holding are two such stakeholders. Keep the Rothschild name in mind as you read as it will appear again later.

The Italian Orsini family the American Bush family the British royal family the Du Pont family the Morgans Vanderbilts and Rockefellers are identified as owners of Vanguard.

BlackRock and Vanguard own Big Pharma



According to Simply Wall Street as of February 2020 BlackRock and Vanguard were the two largest shareholders in GlaxoSmithKline holding 7% and 3.5% of the shares respectively. At Pfizer the ownership is invested with Vanguard being the largest investor and BlackRock the second largest shareholder.

Keep in mind that stock ownership indices can change at any time as companies buy and sell on a regular basis so don’t get hung up on percentages. The bottom line is that BlackRock and Vanguard individually and combined own enough stock at any given time that we can easily say that they easily control both Big Pharma and centralized legacy media and more.

It matters because pharmaceutical companies are driving responses to Covid-19 all of which so far have endangered public health rather than optimizing it and traditional media outlets have been complicit willing to spread their propaganda an Official false narrative that has and still is misleading audiences and fostering fear based on lies.

To have any chance of correcting this we must understand who the central actors are where the damaging dictates are coming from and why these false narratives are being created in the first place.

As noted in Global Justice Now’s December 2020 report “Big Pharma’s Horrifying Story” we simply cannot allow pharmaceutical companies “which have a long history of prioritizing corporate profits over corporate health. people” continue to dictate Covid-19 responses.

In it they review the shameful history of the world’s top seven pharmaceutical companies that are now developing and manufacturing gene-based drugs and “vaccines” against Covid-19 while the mainstream media has helped suppress information on older drugs. readily available that have been shown to be highly effective against infection.

BlackRock and Vanguard own the media



When it comes to The New York Times in May 2021 BlackRock is the second largest shareholder with 7.43% of total shares just after The Vanguard Group which owns the largest share (8.11%).

In addition to The New York Times Vanguard and BlackRock are also the two main owners of Time Warner Comcast Disney and News Corp four of the six media companies that control more than 90% of the US media landscape.

It goes without saying that if you are in control of so many media outlets you can control entire nations through carefully orchestrated and organized centralized propaganda disguised as journalism.

BlackRock and Vanguard together form a hidden monopoly on global asset holding and through their influence over centralized media have the power to manipulate and control a large part of the world’s economy and events and how the world sees everything.

Given that BlackRock announced in 2018 that it has “societal expectations” of the companies it invests in its potential role as a lynchpin in the Great Reboot and “build back better” plan cannot be overlooked.

This information demonstrates how competition is “undermined by owning shares in competing companies” and “blurs the lines between private equity and government affairs by working closely with regulators” and it would be hard not to see how BlackRock and Vanguard facilitate the Big Reboot and the so-called “green” revolution both of which are part of the same wealth theft scheme.



BlackRock and Vanguard own the world



That claim will be even clearer once you realize that this duo’s influence is not limited to Big Pharma and the media. Importantly BlackRock also works closely with central banks around the world including the United States Federal Reserve which is a private not a federal entity. It lends money to the Central Bank acts as an advisor to the Central Bank and develops the Central Bank software.

BlackRock and Vanguard also own shares in a long list of other companies including Microsoft Apple Amazon Facebook and Alphabet Inc. From 2017’s “These Three Companies Own America” ​​on The Conversation it would be nearly impossible to list them all.

A global monopoly few know about



How can we link BlackRock and Vanguard and the globalist families that own them to the Great Reboot? Barring a public confession we have to analyze the relationships between these gigantic globalist-owned corporations and consider the influence they can exert through those relationships. As Lew Rockwell noted: “When Rothschild’s Lynn Forester wants the United States to be a one-party country (like China) and does not want voter identification laws passed in the United States so that more electoral fraud can be perpetrated to achieve that end.

What do they do?



Forester holds a conference call with the world’s top 100 CEOs and tells them to publicly denounce the passage of Georgia’s anti-corruption law as ‘Jim Crow’ and order his obedient CEOs to boycott the state of Georgia as we saw with Coca- Cola and Major League Baseball and even Hollywood star Will Smith… In this conference call we see shadows of the Great Reset the 2030 Agenda the New World Order.

The UN wants to make sure like [World Economic Forum founder and CEO Klaus] Schwab that by 2030 poverty hunger pollution and disease no longer plague the Earth… To achieve this The UN wants the taxes of western countries to be divided by the elite mega-corporations to create a completely new society. For this project the UN says we need a world government that is the UN itself. “

It seems then quite clear that the alleged solutions for the Covid-19 pandemic was orchestrated to bring about this New World Order the Great Reboot. At the center of it all is the “heart” into which all streams of global wealth flow: BlackRock and Vanguard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vd3RvbG92ZS5jb20uYXUvY2VsZWJyaXR5L2NlbGVicml0eS1uZXdzL2FiYmllLWNoYXRmaWVsZC1icm9va2UtYmx1cnRvbi1pbnN0YWdyYW0tNzA2NjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbie Chatfield reveals where she stands with Brooke Blurton after the Bachelorette refollowed her following feud,"Abbie Chatfield has weighed in on the status of her friendship with Brooke Blurton following their very public falling out.

The project which will be located north of Flagstaff is scheduled to begin delivering clean energy onto SRP’s power grid by December 2023.

“With SRP’s newly announced utility-scale renewable resources nearly 50% of the energy delivered to SRP customers by 2025 will be carbon-free” said Kelly Barr SRP’s Chief Strategy Corporate Services and Sustainability Executive. “Wind power from this project will bring more diversity to our resource mix which is growing rapidly in clean energy generation. Furthermore utility-scale wind power is a great complement to solar power generation as wind often blows at times when the sun is not shining.”

The Babbitt Ranch Energy Center represents SRP’s newest wind contract and will produce enough energy to power about 40000 typical residential homes.

“We are very pleased to continue working with SRP to deliver low-cost clean renewable energy to its customers” said Matt Handel senior vice president of development for NextEra Energy Resources the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and the sun. “The Babbitt Ranch Energy Center will also create a significant economic stimulus for the local community creating good jobs and millions in additional tax revenue.”

SRP was the first utility in Arizona to add wind power to its energy resource mix and still receives all energy output from the 127-MW Dry Lake Wind Power Project which was the first large-scale wind power facility built in the state.

With the Phoenix metropolitan area growing three times the national average SRP must continue to build new generation resources that help meet rising energy demand from customers while also supporting SRP in its long-term decarbonization goals. SRP is committed to reduce carbon intensity (from 2005 levels) by more than 65 percent by 2035 and 90 percent by 2050.

In June 2020 SRP issued a request for information (“RFI”) for up to 500 MW of wind resources. Following that process and discussions with NextEra Energy Resources as well as other developers SRP decided the NextEra-proposed Babbitt Ranch Wind Farm would be the most viable wind project that would be commercially operational within the required timeline to meet growing customer demand.

The contract for this wind farm project does not affect the amount of generation SRP is seeking through its current all-source request for proposals (RFP) which is seeking competitive proposals for up to 400 MW of peak generating capacity by summer 2024 and another 600 MW by summer 2026 for a total up to 1000 MW by summer of 2026.

The wind farm is scheduled to be operational and delivering energy to SRP’s power grid by December 2023 the utility said.

Barr said nearly 50% of the energy delivered to the company’s customers will be carbon-free by 2025.

SRP’s new wind-powered addition joins its 127-megawatt Dry Lake Wind Power Project located east of Payson which was the state’s first wind farm the utility said.

The utility company said it is seeking more power-generating possibilities as the Phoenix metropolitan area grows at three times the national average.

SRP said it is seeking up to 1000 megawatts of peak generating capacity by summer 2026 to meet the rising energy demand as the area grows.

JUNO BEACH — In the first project of its kind in Northwest Florida Florida Power & Light Company has finished replacing overhead power lines with more reliable underground lines to continue improving service and speed storm restoration for customers in a west Pensacola neighborhood.

FPL completed the undergrounding project for 131 homes in the Myrtle Grove community as part of a pilot to find cost-effective ways to put power lines underground. Trees and vegetation blowing into overhead power lines are a leading cause of outages particularly during severe weather. Putting power lines underground improves reliability during good weather and bad.

“Because of the huge old tree canopy there was often severe damage and power outages when hurricanes or major storms came through this neighborhood” said longtime Myrtle Grove resident Jo Eichelberger. “So you can imagine how thrilled I was to see the underground service come. Also I’m very particular about my yard and put a lot of time and work into it so I’m pleased that when the job was over you couldn’t tell they were here.""

Northwest Florida makes the switch: Gulf Power is transitioning to FPL on Jan. 1. Here's what customers need to know

Denise Kelly another longtime resident added: “I’m excited to get the new underground service. They were very professional and let us know everything they were going to do before they did it. In the past we would often get an outage when there was a storm. Even when it was taken care of as quickly as possible it’s much better not to have an outage in the first place.”

FPL plans to bring the benefits of undergrounding to more neighborhoods in Northwest Florida and throughout the entire FPL service area.

More than 500000 customers in Northwest Florida who were served by Gulf Power began receiving service under the FPL name on Jan. 1. The undergrounding program is one example of the benefits customers in Northwest Florida are already receiving as a result of the integration with FPL. Since joining the FPL family in 2019 the reliability of service for customers in Northwest Florida has improved by more than 50 percent.

The Clash is drivers’ version of a high school class reunion. It’s a chance to get together with the old gang though everyone wonders why the class secretary picked an out-of-the-way restaurant with expensive food inconvenient parking and a couple of drunks hanging out in the bar who may or may not have been part of the graduating class. Everyone throws a couple of bucks into the raffle but going home without the 28-inch flatscreen isn’t a deal-killer.

On the other hand Speedweeks is a homecoming weekend that seemingly goes on forever for which the participants are grateful. There’s a fair amount of partying and frivolity as people reconnect after some time away from the old place but there are always guys who are all business. They’re there to do make deals and money.

Of the two events atop the NASCAR Cup Series schedule it’s Speedweeks that matters most and the countdown is on for the Feb. 15 2022 start of the action with a pair of 50-minute practices. It will mark the first opportunity for many fans to see the Next Gen cars running wide open and dressed out in their new paint schemes.

While it’s true that racing begins Feb. 6 with the Busch Light Clash what fans see in that exhibition (it’s not a points race) figures to be a questionable representation of racing. Even with the final field cut to a more manageable 23 cars paving over the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum field with a quarter-mile asphalt track banked 2.5 degrees throughout isn’t conducive to real racing. And with the pits relegated to an area outside the stadium drivers cutting a tire a few laps into the 37.5-mile race a likelihood with cars running in such close confines might as well call it a day.

On the other hand Daytona Speedweeks is six glorious days culminating in the Daytona 500 the first points race of the season and one normally full of fireworks.

Here’s the rundown on the schedule accommodating six races across four divisions (all times ET):

Tuesday Feb. 15:

5:05-5:55 p.m.: First practice for NASCAR Cup Series teams.

6:35-7:25 p.m.: Second practice for NASCAR Cup Series teams.

Wednesday Feb. 16:

8:05 p.m.: NASCAR Cup Series qualifying (two rounds).

Thursday Feb. 17:

4:35-5:25 p.m.: Practice for NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.

5:30-6:20 p.m.: Practice for ARCA Racing Series.

7 and 9 p.m.: NASCAR Cup Series Duels (two 150-mile races).

Friday Feb. 18:

1:30 p.m.: ARCA Racing Series qualifying.

3 p.m.: NASCAR Camping World Truck Series qualifying.

4:35-5:25 p.m.: First practice for NASCAR Xfinity Series.

6-6:50 p.m.: Third practice for NASCAR Cup Series.

7:30 p.m.: NASCAR Camping World Truck Series NextEra Energy 250.

Saturday Feb. 19:

10:30-11:20 a.m.: Final practice for NASCAR Cup Series.

11:35 a.m.: NASCAR Xfinity Series qualifying.

1:30 p.m.: ARCA Lucas Oil 200.

5 p.m.: NASCAR Xfinity Series “Beef It’s What’s For Dinner 300.”

Sunday Feb. 20

2:30 p.m.: NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500 (200 laps)

Michael McDowell is the defending champion of the Daytona 500 Austin Cindric won the 2021 Xfinity opener at Daytona and Ben Rhodes started the truck series season with a trip to victory lane.

By the way Daytona International Speedway officials have announced that grandstand admission tickets and RV parking for the Daytona 500 officially sold out more than a month ahead of the Daytona Speedweeks opener.

Many regard Michael Jordan as the greatest of all time. Jordan won six championships with Chicago Bulls which included two three-peats. He was influential in globalizing and commercializing the game of basketball and its stakeholders. In fact he himself signed the historic Nike deal that helped him become a billionaire now.

His Airness‘ net worth is roughly $1.6 billion currently. During his 14-year-old NBA career he earned around $93 million from salaries. However now despite his retirement he earns around $100 million per year through several endorsements and investments. Jordan signed the historic Nike deal back in 1984 for $250000 upfront and his own sneaker line.

Until 2019 the Nike Air Jordan brand made around $3 billion and MJ made $1.3 billion of that amount. The 1984 deal changed the landscape of the sneaker industry and made Nike one of the biggest sports brands in the world. However American rapper Master P has called out Jordan for not having any stake in Nike.

Master P calls out Michael Jordan for not owning a stake in Nike

Master P the singer of ‘Ice Cream Man’ recently expressed his opinion on Michael Jordan’s Nike deal. He said that Jordan ‘built’ Nike and transformed it into what it is now.

“If you look at Michael Jordan’s career. Even though he’s a billionaire now. But he had a million-dollar deal to which I’m thinking what if he got a percentage of Nike back in those days” Master P said.

“Because he built that company turned it into an empire. We was wearing converse back in the day. We wasn’t wearing Nike was wearing converse and Adidas. And if you look at it Michael Jordan he trademarked his name that turned him into a multi-billionaire. But imagine if he had shares in that company. Imagine if he had stock in that company. Imagine if they gave him a percentage for what he what he’s doing.”

It was an interesting opinion from Master P. It’s no secret that Nike has made billions since landing Jordan in 1984. While Jordan has made his name in the business and investment industry post-retirement he would have made much more if he had any ownership in Nike.

By Ko Dong-hwan



Pitching tents hours before the opening of Nike stores so as to be the first to get inside customers sprinted into the stores like a mad mob. A witness to the scene at Shinsegae Department Store in Daegu said it was ""scary to see them running like zombies.""



The commotion happened on Jan. 14 when Nike's Air Jordan 1 Low G sneakers landed at some 30 Nike stores nationwide in limited quantities. The shoes sold for 179000 won a pair.



Shinsegae Department Store Daegu stocked 100 pairs of the shoes while other stores also only carried a limited number. All on the same day members of an online community of sneaker lovers called ""Nike Mania"" shared news of having witnessed people getting into fights in front of stores in Daegu or Yeongdeungpo District in Seoul running inside a store in the city of Uijeongbu and the shoes being sold-out from a store in Ilsandong District.



While some may have just liked the shoes and bought a pair purely for themselves the Michael Jordan sneakers were also being bought for another purpose: so that customers could later resell the shoes for much higher prices.

Special to The Desert Sun

There are many ways to say “thank you” and the Literary Society of the Desert (LSD) found an exceptional way. In December the organization hosted a pre-season celebration at the Coachella Valley Repertory (CVRep) Playhouse for sponsors patrons and benefactors showcasing author Mitchell James Kaplan and his award-winning novel ""Rhapsody"" the story of George Gershwin.

The “thank you” to sponsors and donors was with heartfelt appreciation. The society a longtime gem in desert life was brought to an abrupt end when sponsor Northern Trust withdrew its support taking its membership and operations information.

Three members were determined not to let it die. Donna Martin Joanne Mintz and Nancy Cunningham formed a team/committee to establish a new nonprofit with a new name the Literary Society of the Desert.

They started from scratch. Replenishing the depleted treasury was essential to continue presenting literary luncheons in the desert and the organization's traditional grants to schools. Other donors joined in to create new sponsorships and work toward building a solid foundation in the Coachella Valley.

An Evening of Rhapsody began with a cocktail reception and an opportunity to meet the author now a resident of Roanoke Virginia and learn about his historical novel.

In the playhouse Kaplan took center stage joined by pianist Georgi Latso. Kaplan took the audience on a historical tour of music from the classical in the salons and concert halls of Europe to the changes brought on by the two world wars and into the American experience. Music and identity have always been closely related he said mentioning examples such as Irish mountain music of Appalachia bluegrass and the blues and gospel of Black Americans. Each represented an expression of their own identity and something of a protest while not feeling fully assimilated into the mainstream of social life.

The program began with Latso playing ""Rhapsody in Blue."" Interspersed with the author’s story about Gershwin and his long relationship with Kay Swift another songwriter the audience was treated to clips of Al Jolson singing ""Swanee"" as well as young dancers in the early days of musicals including Angela Lansbury Ginger Rogers Fred Astaire and other performers. Latso also played Scott Joplin’s ""The Entertainer"" and at the end of the program was joined by Kaplan with pieces from ""Porgy and Bess.""

The society also sponsors a student program. Each season they host ten schools and have approximately 100 students in total attend. A 50-minute private meeting and discussion between the guest author and students precedes each monthly luncheon during the season. A copy of the featured book is provided for the entire classroom.

Coordinating the student program is LSD board member Mintz. Recipient schools include California State University San Bernardino Campus; Cathedral City High School; Coachella Valley High School; College of the Desert; Desert Hot Springs High School; Indio High School; La Quinta High School; Palm Desert High School; Palm Springs High School; Palm Valley School; Rancho Mirage High School; Shadow Hills High School; Summit High School; West Shores High School and Xavier College Preparatory.

In addition the Literary Society of the Desert provides an annual grant to all 12 libraries in the Coachella Valley. The grants are due to the generosity of sponsors patrons and library benefactors.

Among the guests enjoying the evening were sponsors Nancy and Tom Cunningham Carlyn and Robin Stonehill Mary Lou Pilcher Jean Viereck Fran Muir Lyn Chernis Joanne and Myron Mintz Martin and Li-Anne and Fred Mannix.

From 2016-2021 the American has arguably been one of the best matchplay players in the world securing victory at the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play in 2019 as well as a runner-up placing the year before. During that five year stretch his record stands at an impressive 16-6-2.

It's not just on the PGA Tour stage where Kisner has shown his matchplay pedigree. At the 2017 President's Cup the American went undefeated for the week managing two wins and two halves against an extremely competitive International team.

Kisner claimed 3 out of 4 points at the President's Cup - 2.5 of them came with Phil Mickelson. (Image credit: Getty Images)

Despite all of this success Kisner still hasn't forgotten about the previous Ryder Cup snubs. After missing out in 2016 and 2018 the American had thrown his name into contention for a Ryder Cup Captains pick just weeks prior to the staging of the event at Whistling Straits claiming victory at the Wyndham Championship.

However a missed cut at the first FedEx Cup playoff event the Northern Trust followed by finishing tied for last at the BMW Championship meant that Captain Steve Stricker decided to go for youth picking Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele among others.

“I don’t know man. They don’t like me I guess” Kisner told GOLF’s Subpar podcast. “I don’t know. I didn’t give a s**t. It’s too political for me I didn’t really care and I don’t really get caught up in that s**t. I love Stricker to death but he didn’t pick me this year which I get — I didn’t play worth a s**t in the playoff.”

The Wyndham Championship was his fourth PGA Tour title. (Image credit: Getty Images)

When the Ryder Cup returns in 2023 the American will be nearly 40 and although players have made their debuts at an older age it appears the landscape for American talent is only growing more competitive. Kisner has confronted this reality and feels content with how his career has gone so far.

Some analysts argue that Nigeria was plunged into crisis prior to this sad day because it was an artificial creation or “mere geographical expression”. Others even claim that the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Protectorates in 1914 was the root of all crises.

First all nations are artificially based on myths forged by propaganda as clearly demonstrated by Peter Furtado (editor (2013) History of Nations: How their Identities Were Forged). Secondly both Northern and Southern Protectorates were artificial creations of the British. They never existed as political entities in the pre-colonial era.

The British later decided to create three regions: East North and West. They made them the federating units. They were not equal in size. They were all multi-ethnic entities. None of the three major ethnic groups: Hausa Igbo and Yoruba had an ethnic nation-state in the pre-colonial period. But the Richards Constitution 1947 which created the regions gave them the impetus for dominance and the false feeling of “nations” within the country. The Richards Constitution was the most undemocratic Constitution ever. All subsequent Constitutions up to 1963 were Richards Constitution as amended and therefore have the same strong regional features.

The First Republic was bedeviled by acrimony because the constitution created powerful political divisions that made compromises difficult. The Prime Minister tried as much as he could. Chief Anthony Enahoro acknowledged this effort: “one of the cementing factors (and I say it with all sincerity) has been the person of the prime minister. If we had someone else -one of our friends across the floor – in that position it is doubtful if the federation would have been one today” (Clark Trevor (1991) Right Honorable Gentleman p. 634). Hence another writer noted: “How right he was can be seen from the fact that not quite two years after he left the scene the nation drifted speedily into war and for thirty months tore itself apart by a civil war which nearly resulted in the disintegration of the country as a single political entity” (Augustus Adebayo (1986) Power in Politics p. 48).

The politicians were not patient enough and they wanted to take power by all means and those with the power wanted to retain it by all means. In an attempt to retain power the Northern Peoples Congress (NPC)-National Council of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC) coalition Federal Government flexed its muscles against the Action Group (AG) by involvement in the Western Regional crisis. The Southern parties: AG and NCNC realized that the only way to seize power from the NPC was to attack its “basis of power by whatever means necessary” which was the northern population that gave it more seats at the Federal House of Representatives. And the census of 1962 offered the opportunity. “Southern governments realized that if they could manipulate the census numbers in 1962 they could reverse the northern population majority and gain more seats for the southern regions in the federal assembly”.

The Eastern and Western regions had an increase of seventy percent when the census figures were released while the Northern region had only a thirty percent increase since the last census of 1953. The figures “were no doubt grossly inaccurate”. They were cancelled and another census was conducted and released in November 1963. The result of which showed that “the Northern Region had grown at a pace commensurate with the East and West: some 8 million new northern figures had been discovered” (quotations from Falola T. and Heaton M. M. 2008 A History of Nigeria Cambridge University Press Cambridge United Kingdom). It has also been earlier observed that: “Obviously southern Nigerians were determined to wrest power from the Hausa-Fulani by manipulating the results” (Ostheimer John (1973) Nigerian Politics p. 54).

When this failed the opposition politicians decided to support military termination of civilian rule. Chief SG Ikoku (of AG) confirmed this when he stated that: “I don’t want to embarrass anybody so I won’t give names but we had about three or four senior officers in the army with whom were discussing political prospects” (SG Ikoku ‘Discussion’ in Inside Nigerian History 1950-1970: Events Issues and Sources edited by Yusufu Bala Usman and George Amale Kwanashie p. 59). The soldiers mostly of Igbo origin struck on January 15 1966 and they killed Abubakar Tafawa Balewa the Prime Minister of the Federal Republic Ahmadu Bello Premier SL Akintola his ally Premier of Western Region and many senior military officers of Northern origin. The coup was interpreted as an ethnically targeted violent solution to the federal crisis.

The Majors led by Chukwuma Kaduna Nzegwu who masterminded the first violent coup in Nigeria’s history on January 15 1966 apparently had no idea of how to govern the country apart from eliminating the politicians and other military officers they hated. Major General JTU Aguiyi-Ironsi used the opportunity and take over the power. He has also been accused of complicity in the murder of Brigadier Zakari Maimalari one of Nigeria’s finest professional soldiers. General Aguiyi-Ironsi’s solution to the failures of the 1947-1963 Constitution was the termination of federalism and introduction of a unitary system by Military Decree. Most of his advisers in this unitary experiment were from his ethnic group. Also he refused to put trial the military coup plotters of January 15 1966 who assassinated politicians and other military officers. There was widespread unrest before northern military officers led by Majors: Murtala Mohammed Theophilus Danjuma and Martins Adamu terminated his regime and assassinated him.

Chinua Achebe the erudite novelist tried to change the narrative of the January 15 1966 Coup in his book There Was A Country to portray his ethnic group as the victim but this has been debunked: “Igbo in the North were widely taunting their hosts on the loss of their leaders. Celestine Ukwu a popular Igbo musician released songs titled Ewu Ne Ba Akwa (Goats Are Crying) and others celebrating “Igbo power” the “January Victory.” Posters stickers postcards cartoons displaying the murdered Sardauna begging Major Nzeogwu at the gates of heaven or Balewa burning outright in pits of hell or Nzeogwu standing St. George-like on Sardauna the defeated dragon began to show up across Northern towns and cities. These provocations were so pervasive that they warranted the promulgation of Decree 44 of 1966 banning them”. Even Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe noted these atrocities in his The Origins of the Civil War: “Some Ibo elements who were domiciled in Northern Nigeria taunted northerners by defaming their leaders through means of records or songs or pictures. They also published pamphlets and postcards which displayed a peculiar representation of certain northerners living or dead in a manner likely to provoke disaffection.” These images and songs eventually led to the so-called pogroms/ethnic-cleansing/genocide not the coup” as Achebe claimed. In fact “the coup was in January the pogroms started late in May and the provocations were in-between” (quotations from Demola Awoyokun ‘Biafra: The Facts the Fiction’ PM News March 5 2013).

Colonel Gowon’s regime that took over from General Aguiyi-Ironsi decided to create states to appease the minorities in the Northern and Eastern Regions. The disastrous civil war was fought from 1967-1970 as a result of the attempt of Colonel Odemegwu-Ojukwu-led Biafran secession. Five years after the war General Gowon was removed in a bloodless coup. General Murtala Mohammed took over. This regime decided that Nigeria should return to democracy under a Presidential System. A committee headed by Chief Rotimi Williams drafted a new constitution. All subsequent constitutions from 1979 were the 1979 Constitution as amended. This constitution made the whole country the constituency of the president unlike the previous parliamentary constitution. It was also accepted by the founding fathers of Nigeria who were alive at that time and contested elections under its power: Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe Chief Obafemi Awolowo Mallam Aminu Kano and Joseph Tarka contrary to the false claims of ethnocentric hate mongers. It adopted the principle of federal character. Chief Obafemi Awolowo was the first politician to advocate “federal character” for power-sharing and he also proposed between 30 and forty states to resolve the minority question which the Willinks Commission could not resolve (see Michael Maduagwu 2019 Federal Character and Affirmative Action: History and Diversities Policies in the United States and Nigeria for Chief Awolowo’s position on page 101).

Nigeria is now at crossroads just as in the First Republic when politicians failed to take power democratically they mobilized the populace along ethnic and regional lines. Ethnic champions are now campaigning for the destruction of the federation if it is not restructured in such a manner as to allow them to take power. In their frustration they want the country to revert to the 1963 Constitution an amended version of the 1947 Richards Constitution. They claim that the military had drafted the 1999 Constitution but they never say that the 1963 Constitution is the 1947 Constitution as amended. The colonialists drafted the 1947 Constitution which gave birth to the 1963 Constitution. The desperation of politicians led to January 15 1966 Coup now they are also desperate but hopefully Nigerians will not allow them to plunge the country into another crisis.

The planned acquisition of rocket engine firm Aerojet Rocketdyne has already drawn major scrutiny owing to allegations that it will give Lockheed an unfair competitive edge in the highly-concentrated missile defense propulsion and hypersonic development market.

Aerojet Rocketdyne is an American rocket and missile-propulsion manufacturer. It is also involved in the ongoing research to develop hypersonic weapons as well as a variety of other munitions targets and undersea systems.

According to the latest reports the US Federal Trade Commission which reviews mergers and acquisitions has postponed a vote on Lockheed Martin’s bid to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne for up to two weeks.

The vote was originally scheduled for midweek the report said adding that the delay would give the FTC additional time to analyze the merger’s conditions. Aerojet shares were up more than 3% in after-hours trading on January 11 as investors saw the delay as a good indicator for the proposed merger the report added.

The $4.4 billion agreement announced in late 2020 is Lockheed’s first major acquisition bid under new CEO Jim Taiclet. In October 2021 the company stated that the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2022.

Lockheed Martin the largest US defense contractor says it reached a deal valued at $4.4 billion to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne a supplier of engines to NASA’s Space Launch System moon rocket and United Launch Alliance’s Atlas Delta and Vulcan rockets. https://t.co/gWtjxvc03b pic.twitter.com/WYRphowIDZ — Spaceflight Now (@SpaceflightNow) December 21 2020

The deal is anticipated to reshape the US defense sector as it would allow the country’s top defense contractor to acquire a major provider of solid-fuel rocket motors. Aerojet’s customers include the Pentagon NASA Boeing Lockheed Martin Raytheon Technologies and the United Launch Alliance.

In June 2021 Aerojet successfully tested a full-scale advanced solid rocket motor as part of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s hypersonic missile program. If the acquisition goes through Lockheed Martin will also have a strong foothold in hypersonic missile development.

Concerns About The Deal

If federal antitrust officials approve this deal experts believe that it will trigger issues in the tactical and strategic offensive missile industries. It would also exacerbate rivalry in the missile defense area by transferring ownership of Aerojet’s solid rocket motor (SRM) production capacity to Lockheed.

SRMs the cutting-edge technology for pushing missiles toward their targets are employed in nearly all missile systems purchased by the US government. Following the Northrop Grumman acquisition of propulsion company Orbital ATK in 2018 Aerojet is the sole surviving independent manufacturer of this crucial propulsion technology.

It is said that Lockheed’s monopoly of Aerojet’s SRM technology would be troublesome since there are only three other businesses that are strong enough to compete against Lockheed as prime contractors for US government missile system deals. All major companies are dependent on Aerojet as a supplier of propulsion components for their solutions.

Raytheon Technologies in particular has openly expressed concern that the merger will force it to rely on a direct rival for most of the propulsion in its missile products. Aerojet Rocketdyne for example is a supplier of solid rocket motors as well as military technology like hypersonic engines.

Furthermore Aerojet is the sole manufacturer of the Divert and Attitude Control System an essential missile defense propulsion technology that allows interceptors to make quick and precise course modifications in order to kill incoming ballistic missiles.

Lockheed’s Forays Into Hypersonic Domain

The development of hypersonic missiles in the United States has accelerated in recent years since China and Russia have lately demonstrated their capabilities. Lockheed Martin is a key player in hypersonic missile technology.

In October 2021 the company opened a new advanced hypersonic missile factory in Courtland Alabama. A month later the Pentagon selected Lockheed Northrop Grumman and Raytheon to research and develop a missile system that would be able to defend the US against potential hypersonic weapons attacks by hostile nations.

Lockheed Martin’s chief financial officer Ken Possenriede earlier argued “vertically integrating Lockheed Martin’s missile manufacturing business with the propulsion supplier would improve the engineering process and reduce the fees that are charged to the government when products are bought from subcontractors.”

The potential acquisition of the Aerojet will undoubtedly boost the chances of Lockheed to fast-track the process as occurred in the instance of Northrop. Orbital ATK was the major provider of solid rocket motors and Northrop Grumman’s acquisition of the firm helped the corporation achieve a commanding lead in the competition for the Air Force’s next-generation intercontinental ballistic missile. Boeing dropped out of the missile program and Northrop won the race.

Raytheon also made similar claims that Lockheed Martin’s ownership of Aerojet would give them a significant edge in future DoD procurements of ballistic and hypersonic missiles. Aerojet would be the major propulsion provider for hypersonic missiles be it ramjet-powered air-breathing missiles or boost-glide vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24vZmVkZXgtYWlyY3JhZnQtdG8tY2FycnktYW50aS1taXNzaWxlLWxhc2VyLWNvdW50ZXJtZWFzdXJlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The FAA Proposes to Allow FedEx Aircraft to Carry Anti-Missile Laser Countermeasures,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='interestingengineering.com', port=443): Read timed out.

NBC News and Reuters report FedEx has asked the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to equip an upcoming fleet of Airbus A321-200 aircraft with an anti-missile laser system. The proposed hardware would disrupt the tracking on heat-seeking missiles by steering infrared laser energy toward the oncoming projectiles.

The courier service pointed to ""several"" foreign incidents where attackers used portable air defense systems against civilian aircraft. While there weren't specific examples NBC pointed to Iran shooting down a Ukranian airliner in January 2020 (reportedly due to mistaking the jet for a cruise missile) and a Malaysian flight brought down by Russia-backed Ukranian separatists in July 2014.

FedEx first applied for the laser system in October 2019. The FAA is open to approval but has proposed ""special conditions"" before lasers could enter service. The system would need failsafes to prevent activation on the ground and couldn't cause harm to any aircraft or people.

The concept of including countermeasures isn't strictly new. Some American commercial aircraft have used anti-missile systems as early as 2008 and FedEx helped trial a Northrop Grumman countermeasure system around the same time. Israel's El Al has used anti-missile systems since 2004. FedEx's plans would be significant though and rare for a courier company. It wouldn't be surprising if more commercial aircraft followed suit even if the risks of attacks remain relatively low."

It’s just never-ending with all the cruise news but there is something that has ended and that’s the CDC’s Conditional Sailing Order. We’ll get into all that shortly along with some major new developments with cancellations and itinerary changes on Carnival Cruise Line Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean. We also need to lighten the outlook a bit with some good cruise news too.

Norwegian Viva Unveiled

We start with some good news from Norwegian Cruise Line with the unveiling of its second Prima-class cruise ship Norwegian Viva! The future vessel will measure 965 feet long and 142500 gross tons with a guest capacity of 3219 at double occupancy.

Viva will feature Ocean Boulevard an outdoor walkway wrapping around the entire ship and over a glass bridge. Other features include 11 unique eateries at the Indulge Food Hall as well as Infinity Beach infinity pools designed to blend into the ocean.

Also on board will be The Rush and The Drop the fastest freefall drop dry slides at sea as well as the Viva Speedway a three-level go-kart racetrack that speeds for a quarter mile around and even through the ship’s funnel at speeds up to 30 miles per hour.

The ship debuts during the summer of 2023. Following a string of introductory inaugural cruises Norwegian Viva will offer Mediterranean sailings from June 15 to November 6 2023. These voyages include eight nine and 10-day voyages from Lisbon Portugal; Venice and Rome Italy; and Athens Greece.

On November 16 2023 the ship is scheduled to begin her first transatlantic crossing departing from Lisbon Portugal for an 11-day voyage heading to New York City. Norwegian Viva will spend the winter season sailing from San Juan Puerto Rico with 7- and 9-day Caribbean itineraries visiting Tortola Barbados St. Lucia St. Maarten Aruba Curacao and other popular Caribbean destinations.

NCL Cancellations

Alright so let’s get into all the latest cancellations by Norwegian Cruise Line which has been almost daily! Just yesterday (January 14 2022) we reported about the Norwegian Gem and here’s what’s going on. The ship was on a 10-day Caribbean itinerary that departed New York City on January 9 but on the first day of the cruise which was a day at sea after setting sail the evening before guests were informed of dramatic itinerary changes.

Two ports – Grand Turk on January 12 and St. Thomas on January 13 – were dropped and the remaining ports were rearranged. No new ports were added and instead the cruise was to have two additional days at sea for a total of six sea days on the 10-day cruise. Just three days later guests received another letter from the ship’s captain that the voyage had been canceled and the ship would be heading back to New York “as a result of COVID-related circumstances.”

Lots going on with the cruise line at the moment as Norwegian Breakaway was also added to the list of NCL vessels that have suspended operations temporarily. And that follows an additional four vessels canceling select sailings as announced on January 13.

So currently there are 12 vessels that are on hold and with some cruises canceled as far as April 23 2022. However some ships such as the Norwegian Pearl are only suspended until the end of January. The NCL ships that are currently still operating are the Norwegian Encore Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Epic. Norwegian Gem is not yet on that list as the next scheduled cruise is still a go.

Carnival Sunshine Sails from Charleston

Some good news this past week! Carnival Sunshine has finally kicked off sailings from Charleston in South Carolina. The vessel has been operating some cruises from Miami and Fort Lauderdale in December and January to replace Carnival Horizon. That vessel was forced to go into a dry dock due to mechanical issues which impacted her maximum cruising speed.

Sunshine departed Charleston on January 13 on a 4-night Bahamas cruise sailing to Nassau. Guests will have a day to enjoy at sea after departure and on the way back home.

Carnival Sunshine will sail on her second cruise from Charleston on January 17. This voyage one of the Carnival Journeys is a 10-day voyage that will sail to St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin islands first followed by calls to Philipsburg St. Maarten St. John’s in Antigua Roast Town in Tortola and Amber Cove Dominican Republic after which the vessel will make her way back to Charleston during two days at sea.

According to the South Carolina ports authority guests can rest assured that they will find the cruise terminal fully prepared to deal with the thousands of guests who will pass through during embarkation days.

When a ship is in the port a team of people will disinfect high-touch areas constantly including handrails doorknobs and other surfaces. Face masks will be mandatory inside the terminal and on board the vessel at all times.

Carnival Cruise Ships Drop Key West

Guests booked on upcoming sailings have received a notification from Carnival Cruise Line on itinerary changes for the Carnival Dream Carnival Conquest and Carnival Sunrise. Only select sailings are impacted in January and February that featured a call in Key West Florida. This comes due to calls to ban large cruise ships and while talks continue between the cruise line and authorities.

The cruise port has now been dropped on sailings for those three vessels and the notification was only sent out on January 13 to impacted guests not leaving much time between the first altered departure for Carnival Dream on January 15.

For Carnival Dream out of Galveston in Texas there are three itinerary changes. The sailings that depart on January 15 29 and February 12 2022 will now only be calling at Freeport Half Moon Cay and Nassau all in the Bahamas. Key West was previously scheduled to be the first port of call during those voyages but that is not the case now.

Four sailings have dropped Key West for the Carnival Conquest based out of Miami in Florida. Departures on January 24 31 February 7 and February 21 2022 have all dropped a call to Key West. Those four-day sailings will now only include a visit to Cozumel in Mexico.

Carnival Sunrise has just its February 3 sailing impacted also based out of Miami Florida. The three-day voyage will only include a call in Cozumel Mexico with Key West being dropped.

CDC’s Order Ends

And the big news for today yes the CDC’s Conditional Sailing Order which was first introduced at the end of October 2020 has come to an end. From today the CDC will make the measure a voluntary one instead of a mandatory measure. Cruise lines will choose whether to follow the CDC’s guidance or implement their own guidelines and procedures.

And it’s pretty obvious right now that cruise lines are going to just keep with the current guidance from the CDC in fact Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has already announced it has opted-in to the program that’s named COVID-19 Program for Cruise Ships Operating in U.S. Waters which is the CDC’s voluntary COVID-19 risk mitigation program for foreign-flagged cruise ships operating in U.S. waters. It means all three cruise brands owned by the cruise company will still follow guidance from the CDC to make sure guests and crew remain safe.

So don’t expect any drastic changes in protocols for now things are just going to continue as normal. It will also be interesting to see what the other major cruise lines decide to do including Carnival and Royal Caribbean.

Cruise Lines Extend Cancellation Program

Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises have extended the Cruise with Confidence cancellation program. For sailings booked by March 31 2022 that depart by September 30 2022 you can cancel up to 48 hours before your sail date and get the full paid value in a future cruise credit.

Guests can use the credit for any sailing that departs within a year of the original sail date or by December 31 2022 whichever is longer.

Independence of the Seas Cancellations

Independence of the Seas is not departing its homeport of Port Canaveral as the cruise line has canceled three sailings. The January 14 eight-day SuperCruise charter a short two-night voyage departing January 22 and another five-day charter K-Love Cruise departing January 24 2022 will no longer go ahead due to COVID-related issues.

More Cruise Headlines

So those are just a handful of the cruise stories from the week if we covered everything we would be here all day and night. So many more headlines that you can take a look at including MSC Cruises informing guests on possible itinerary changes Norwegian Cruise Line overhauls its Latitudes program Carnival Cruise Line glitch sending emails by mistake and check out the exclusive Carnival Horizon photos after completing an urgent dry dock in Italy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzE2L3Bhc3NlbmdlcnMtc3R1Y2stYXQtc2VhLWFmdGVyLW5vcndlZ2lhbi1jYW5jZWxzLWNydWlzZS1taWQtdm95YWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Passengers stuck at sea after Norwegian cancels cruise mid-voyage,"Travelers on a Norwegian Cruise Line ship in the Caribbean have become stuck at sea after the company called off the trip mid-voyage due to COVID-19 issues according to a report.

Aimee Focaraccio said she boarded the Norwegian Gem from New York for a 10-day trip last Sunday for her birthday but the vacation became a “nightmare” when the cruise line canceled the voyage four days later and provided no timeline for the ship to return USA Today reported.

“Without the islands and ports to break up the sea days this is turning into a nightmare. I really can’t imagine four more sea days back to back without much to do” Focaraccio told the outlet.

She said the prospect of being stuck on the boat was “extremely unsettling.”

“Tomorrow will really be the only nice day to enjoy the outdoors and after that we will be stuck inside. With limited shows small crowds and nothing to do. I’m upset” Focaraccio told the news outlet.

Others however were taking the last-minute changes in stride.

“We all knew when we booked during such difficult times due to COVID that there would most likely be changes to our itinerary” Anthony Bivona told the outlet. “It was not the exact itinerary we signed up for but has still been an absolutely amazing cruise.”

No details were provided about the COVID-19 issues that led to the cancellation.

Christine Da Silva senior vice president of branding and communication for Norwegian Cruise Line did not specify exactly when the cruise would return to New York but said it would be “shortly.”

The CEO of one of the world's largest cruise lines has said that cruise holidays have been unfairly singled out by the media and were a victim of their own strict health reporting standards.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings chief executive Frank Del Rio said cruising had become the target of ""cheap headlines"".

The cruise line boss took fire at the media last Friday saying ships had been singled out during the Covid-19 pandemic due to their industry's robust health reporting.

Del Rio said it was lazy sensationalist journalism ""taking advantage of the fact that our industry offers robust testing that we track cases and that we diligently report them to the CDC and other public health administrations.""

Ships docking in the US are required to report to the CDC all illness onboard for crew and passengers.

During a virtual conversation with travel advisors Del Rio was keen to overturn perceptions that cruise travel was any less safe than other forms of travel in the emergence of the omicron variant.

""It's something that no other industries are required to do -- not hotels resorts theme parks airlines or any other part of hospitality.""

In a letter to investors cruise line operators Royal Caribbean Group published its infection rates since fully vaccinated sailings were introduced: ""Since cruising restarted in the US in June 2021 the Royal Caribbean Group has carried 1.1 million guests with 1745 people testing positive—a positivity rate of 0.02 percent.""

'Cruise Ban' continues in New Zealand in 2022

The year started badly for cruise companies. On 4 January the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a Level 4 warning against cruise travel.

""Even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading Covid-19 variants"" the CDC warned.

This weekend the 'conditional sailing order' expired allowing cruises to resume.

While the health agency still considers cruise travel ""high risk"" companies are no longer required to follow the no sail order.

While the reporting of illness is far better on cruise ships and the risk is much better known it has not put insurers' minds at ease.

Travel involving cruise transport is still uninsurable with many providers.

For travellers who choose to go ahead with cruise travel the CDC advises they get fully vaccinated including a booster shot - a condition of carriage for most cruise companies - and get tested three days before and after the trip as well as practising distancing and hygiene measures on board.

In New Zealand the Maritime Border Order continues to freeze out international liners although smaller expeditionary cruises have resumed.

Even when the ban on cruise travel is lifted the restart for New Zealand will require careful planning says the New Zealand Cruise Association.

""The most realistic estimate is that New Zealand cruising will not begin until the last quarter of 2022"" predicted Kevin O'Sullivan CEO of NZCA.

Until then the cruise industry will continue to follow the CDC's voluntary Covid-19 measures to ""instil confidence in the sailing public that cruising is safe"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWNoaW5lLWd1bi1rZWxseS1tZWdhbi1mb3gtMjEzMDA3MDkzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox Turn Heads in Sparkly Ensembles at the F/W23 Dolce & Gabbana Runway Show,"Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox look like the perfect fashion power couple.

Here's why they won't,"Once upon a time you could watch a keynote presentation from any major computer chip company and rest easy in the confidence that the name “Apple” would never pass the lips of any presenter. The message always seemed to be as per the classic Mad Men meme “I don’t think of you at all.”

But oh how the tables have turned. With the transition to Apple silicon well underway and the debut of the high-powered M1 Pro and M1 Max chips last summer major players in the silicon market are hastening to not only mention Apple but to prove how much better their latest products are than that computer company that nobody used to care about.

This past week’s Consumer Electronics Show was a news cavalcade for the likes of Intel AMD and Nvidia all of whom took their time to reassure the vendors that rely on them that yes they could play in the same league as Apple.

Intel me no secrets Intel you no lies

Perhaps none of these three protested so vociferously as Apple’s most recent ex-partner Intel. The company took the wraps off its latest series of laptop-bound processors the Alder Lake series including a top-of-the-line model that it described as “the fastest mobile processor. Ever.” And in the truest press conference braggadocio Intel put out the benchmarks to drive home that fact showing its Core i9-12900HK processor just edging out the M1 Max in some tests and handily surpassing it in others.

Of course if we took every benchmark chart from every manufacturer at face value our brains would go up in a puff of smoke like an evil robot. And given that these chips will probably never make their way into a Mac we are probably stuck with apples-to-oranges (if you’ll pardon the expression) comparisons.

Sure the Alder Lake performance looks impressive. but did anyone else notice the amount of power Intel’s chip consumes compared to the M1 Mac? Sure the Alder Lake performance looks impressive. but did anyone else notice the amount of power Intel’s chip consumes compared to the M1 Mac? Intel Sure the Alder Lake performance looks impressive. but did anyone else notice the amount of power Intel’s chip consumes compared to the M1 Mac? Intel Intel

But even before we get to that point there’s an important factor in one of Intel’s own charts: impressive though the Core i9-12900HK processor may be its power consumption is much higher than the M1 Max starting just below that chip’s 35W and climbing all the way to around 75W. Putting that chip in a MacBook Pro would mean a lot of design tradeoffs that Apple wouldn’t be willing to make even in the name of more power.

Graphic content

But computer processors aren’t the only industry where Apple’s silicon advances are firing shots across the bow. One of the big stories with the M1 Max and M1 Pro is their graphics performance. In the past Apple has worked with both major graphics card companies AMD (which acquired GPU company ATI back in 2006) and Nvidia—both of whom are taking shots at Apple this year with varying degrees of obliqueness.

Nvidia often considered the graphics card behemoth to beat boasted during its CES keynote that laptops using its new RTX GPUs are “up to seven times faster” than a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Max. Except several of the tools for which Nvidia provides benchmarks have either only beta support for running natively on Apple silicon or no support at all. Others benchmarks such as the Blender Cycles package that showed the biggest difference don’t currently support Apple’s Metal graphics framework potentially putting them at a big disadvantage at the moment.

AMD meanwhile at least took aim at the power efficiency of Apple’s chips claiming that some laptops using its new Ryzen 6000 chips can get up to 24-hour battery life—though that is specifically for video playback. (To be fair Apple cites similar caveats in its own battery performance.)

AMD claims 24-hour battery life (video playback) is possible with its new Ryzen 6000 chip. Apple claims 21 hours of Apple TV playback with the M1 Max AMD claims 24-hour battery life (video playback) is possible with its new Ryzen 6000 chip. Apple claims 21 hours of Apple TV playback with the M1 Max AMD AMD claims 24-hour battery life (video playback) is possible with its new Ryzen 6000 chip. Apple claims 21 hours of Apple TV playback with the M1 Max AMD AMD

Apple’s not the only competition for these two graphics heavyweights though. Intel decided to stick its own toe into the GPU business this year with a new series of discrete graphics cards called Arc. With Intel on one side and Apple on the other—not to mention continued supply chain woes that have made graphics cards scarce—both AMD and Nvidia are likely to be feeling the squeeze this year.

Walking away with it

How did this all happen? Did Apple just walk into yet another industry and sit down as the titan?

Granted it’s hard to consider Apple the underdog these days when its market capitalization is flirting with $3 trillion but let’s dispense with the myth that these silicon advances are things that Apple’s just pulled out of its hat. The company spent the last decade carefully designing and continually improving the processors and graphics chips for its mobile devices before finally implementing that technology in its desktop and laptop computers.

It acquired companies that specialize in silicon from the PA Semi purchase in 2008 that laid the groundwork for Apple’s processors to picking up parts of Dialog Semiconductor in 2018 and invested heavily in graphics tech firms like Imagination Technologies. And moreover it’s optimized for a specific case: the best performance it can get at the lowest power consumption.

With 45 years under its belt Apple’s become a master of playing the long game and strategically investing in key technologies then nurturing them over the course of years. So what looks like an amazing magic trick is actually the result of long periods of hard work—propped up by a whole lot of money.

All of that said let’s not forget that performance isn’t the only reason people choose to use a Mac over a PC. Many consumers aren’t likely to switch no matter how much power Apple can bring to bear—the gaming market on the Mac for example has never been comparable to the PC. And even if Apple silicon performance is eventually outclassed there will always be those that simply prefer the experience of the Mac.

But at least as it stands now you can get the joys of that experience and the satisfaction of knowing that your platform’s the one to beat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9Nb3J0aWZ5aW5nLUdlRm9yY2UtUlRYLTMwOTAtVGktYW5kLVJUWC0zMDUwLWxpc3RlZC1yZXRhaWxlci1wcmljZXMtc3VnZ2VzdC1jb25zb2xlcy1vci1sYXB0b3BzLW1pZ2h0LWJlLWEtc21hcnRlci1wdXJjaGFzZS41OTMxOTAuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mortifying GeForce RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 3050 listed retailer prices suggest consoles or laptops might be a smarter ...,"Shocking prices have turned up for AIB partner variants of both the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti and the GeForce RTX 3050. The top-end RTX 3090 Ti was spotted via a Swiss comparison site listed at prices equivalent to US$3500 and upwards. The entry-level RTX 3050 turned up in an Amazon Japan listing for well over its United States MSRP of US$249.

Although the GeForce RTX 3050 and RTX 3090 Ti graphics cards from Nvidia won’t be officially launched until January 27 it appears some AIB partners and retailers are already preparing to fleece the graphics card-buying public for every available cent or penny. This state of affairs has already been widely reported but there had been hope that a fresh injection of stock in the form of RTX 3050 boards and a new option at the premium end with the RTX 3090 Ti could have balanced things out a little in the market. Sadly for gamers and PC builders that is not likely going to be the case.

The RTX 3050 was spotted by leaker momomo_us on Amazon Japan where there was a listing for a Galakuro Gaming GeForce RTX 3050 SKU. The price listed for the card was ¥50138 which is equivalent to about US$439/€385/£321. The expected MSRP for the US market is US$249 and although the suggested retail price for Japan may have been different it wouldn’t have been this much greater. Apparently all of the RTX 3050 cards listed by Galakuro (Galax) were sold at that inflated price.

As for the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti VideoCardz has shared some depressing news for GPU hunters looking for a reasonable-priced unit. The upcoming board has been listed on a Swiss comparison site for prices ranging from €3129 (US$3571/£2611) for an MSI Gaming X TRIO model all the way up to 4111 Swiss francs (US$4498/€3941/£3288) for an MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X variant. While the MSRP for the top-end Ampere card is still unknown listings with prices from over US$3500 to almost US$4500 are likely to become more common.

While the 3090 Ti prices may be placeholders it still might be a smart move for gamers to consider putting their money into alternatives such as premium consoles like the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X which are also hard to find at acceptable prices or even a GeForce RTX 30-series laptop. Many laptop OEMs such as Dell (and Alienware) Asus MSI and Razer have devices featuring one of the ray-tracing capable Ampere chips. Although they don’t offer the same raw power as their desktop counterparts due to form factor restrictions these mobile alternatives can certainly manage hardcore gaming sessions and cope with serious graphics editing duties at less ridiculous prices.

NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Custom Graphics Cards Cost Up To $4500 US Making It The Most Expensive GeForce To Date

We had already reported how the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti would be NVIDIA's most expensive single-chip flagship when it launches. While we are bound to hear more details later this month it looks like a few European retailers have decided to list various custom models online. Videocardz was able to spot several Swiss and German retail outlets that are listing the MSI variant of the cards at various prices. These prices are preliminary but you also shouldn't expect the card to be priced at all around its MSRP which is going to be higher than the existing RTX 3090 ($1499 US). The prices are listed below:

#1 MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X: 3201 EUR / ~3654 USD

#2 MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X: 3678 CHF / ~4024 USD

#3 MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X: 4111 CHF / ~4497 USD

MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti GAMING X TRIO: 3129 EUR / ~3571 USD

Now these prices aren't stable and vary a lot from retailer to retailer. The same MSI GeForce RTX 3090 SUPRIM X can be found for as low as $3654 USD and up to $4497 US. That's a difference of 23% and we also have to consider that all of these prices are with VAT included. Compared to the RTX 3090 prices from the same retailers you are looking at a 30% price bump for the 'Ti' variant.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is going to be really pricey when it launches but when it launches is the bigger question since the production of custom models has reportedly been halted due to the BIOS and hardware issues. Now these are all rumors for now and NVIDIA has stated that they will have more details to share later this month.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Graphics Card Specifications - Full Fat GA102 GPU & 24 GB GDDR6X Memory

At the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card lies the GA102 GPU. The GA102 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA102 GPU is the fastest gaming GPU that NVIDIA has produced. The GPU is based on Samsung's 8nm custom process node designed specifically for NVIDIA and features a total of 28 Billion transistors. It measures 628mm2 which makes it the 2nd biggest gaming GPU ever produced right below the Turing TU102 GPU.

2 of 9

The new shader core on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is 2.7x faster the new RT cores are 1.7x faster while the new Tensor cores are up to 2.7x faster than the previous generation Turing GPUs. The 2nd Generation RT core delivers dedicated hardware-accelerated ray-tracing performance & features twice the ray/triangles intersection with concurrent RT graphics and compute operations.

For the GeForce RTX 3090 NVIDIA has enabled a total of 84 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 10752 CUDA cores (vs 82 SM / 10496 cores on RTX 3090 Non-Ti). In addition to the CUDA cores NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores Tensor cores and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The GPU runs at a base clock speed of 1560 MHz and a boost clock speed of 1860 MHz. The card has a TDP of 450W.

In terms of memory the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti comes packed with 24 GB of memory and that too the next-generation GDDR6X design. With Micron's latest and greatest graphics memory dies the RTX 3090 Ti can deliver GDDR6X memory speeds of 21 Gbps. That along with a bus interface of 384-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 1008 Gbps.

These documents help engineers incorporate particular solutions into specific applications. A number of companies recently released mobile charging-based reference designs to help miniaturize chargers and maximize switching efficiency. In this article we'll review some of the specs and design benefits of these recent publications to assess how they may be of use to embedded designers.

Power Integrations Cuts Down the Component Count in USB PD

Power Integrations recently published a reference design for its InnoSwitch3-PD switcher and HiperPFS-4 controller IC-based DER-937. This technical report contains essential information on the efficient design of a USB power delivery (PD) programmable power supply (PPS) charger.

The company a manufacturer of high-voltage power conversion-intensive semiconductors claims the DER-937 design exceeds 93% efficiency when properly implemented. Moreover Power Integrations says this design offers exceptional no-load performance at a minimized circuit power requirement of 40 mW at 230 VAC.

The DER-937 schematic above incorporates several components including Power Integrations’ InnoSwitch3-PD switcher IC and a USB power delivery controller. The controller is essential for synchronous rectification by offering output voltage current sensing and gate driving capabilities.

Some key specifications of the DER-937 reference design include:

Output voltage (V OUT ) range: 3.3 V to 21 V

) range: 3.3 V to 21 V Input voltage range: 90 V to 295 V

Minimum efficiency: 92.64%

RoHS and EU ErP compliance

Single output

100 mW output power

With a low component count of 117 the reference design may provide several benefits for ultra-compact USB charger manufacturing: it is said to optimize space shorter design times and simplify component sourcing.

Silanna Semiconductor Accelerates Fast-charging Design

Another recent reference design comes from Silanna Semiconductor for its RD-29—an Active Clamp Flyback (ACF). Silanna says this design can help designers quickly create 65 W 1 C fast-charger applications.

The design incorporates the SZ1131 ACF controller a new addition to its CO2 Smart Power IC family. The design also includes Transphorm’s Super GaN FET. This travel adapter and battery charger-based reference design is said to offer a few other important specs:

Efficiency: 94.5%

Minimized no-load power consumption: 23 mW at 230 VAC

Footprint: 34.5 mm x 34 mm x 30.5 mm

Power density: 30W/inch3

Silanna says the design will help engineers exceed radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI) requirements by over 6dB—a boon for developing miniaturized 65 W low power consumption chargers.

The reference design features multi-mode operation (e.g. valley mode switching burst mode and quasi-resonant) a high switching frequency of 140 kHz and cycle-by-cycle adaptive digital control. Additionally the RD-29 reference design also considers protection against overvoltage under-voltage lockout overvoltage lockout overpower and short circuit.

NXP Steps on the Gas for Automotive Wireless Charging

Lastly NXP aims to meet the growing demand for in-vehicle wireless mobile charging with its recently-released reference design. NXP says this design is the first in the industry to be certified by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC).

It includes a Qi-certified board with NXP wireless charging microcontrollers (MCUs) optional near-field communication (NFC) secure element and controller area network (CAN)/local interconnect network (LIN) transceiver.

Since the reference design gives engineers access to NXP’s comprehensive wireless charging software library they can modify a design for targeted wireless charging applications.

A few other relevant features include:

Wireless power efficiency: 75%

Operating frequency: 127.7 kHz

Foreign object detection functionality

Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity

Temperature sensing capability

Ambient operating temperature range: -40°C to +105°C

NFC card detection

Minimized bill of material for on-chip demodulation

AEC-Q100 grade 2-certified

The NXP WCT-15WAUTO13 reference design is said to leverage EMC optimization and safety features. The design includes auto-grade components and automotive functions to meet each modified charging requirement. It also offers a maximum power delivery of 40 W.

Reference Designs Continue to Speed Up Development

Reference designs are essential for prototyping and integrating solutions. They save time and costs while mitigating risk. This is because reference design developers—predominantly technology component vendors—have already implemented and tested the designs. Vendors also develop and release reference designs based on their products to give them a competitive advantage.

The three recently-released designs from Power Integrations Silanna Semiconductor and NXP showcase how these documents can speed up the development process for both simple and complex charging applications—whether they be tailored for fast-charging or in-vehicle wireless charging.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But grabbing a checkered flag is more satisfying than making the highlight reel.

""This has been my favorite night so far"" the New Waverly Texas driver said Friday after his $5000 victory in the fourth round of the miniseries.

The third-starting Erb won a mid-race lead-swapping duel with pole-starting Earl Pearson Jr. of Jacksonville Fla. and pulled away late by deftly handling traffic at the 3/8-mile oval that's hosting the Wild West Shootout for the first time.

Pearson finished 1.159 seconds behind Erb at the checkers while Bobby Pierce of Oakwood Ill. improved six positions in landing on the podium. Johnny Scott of nearby Las Cruces N.M. rallied from 13th to fourth and Mike Marlar of Winfield Tenn. survived a couples of scrapes to round out the top five.

Pearson led the first 11 laps in his traditional low groove but when he decided to give the high side a shot on a lap-12 restart Erb pounced and grabbed the lead. Pearson quickly retreated to his favored low groove and inched back ahead on the 14th lap but Erb regained the point at halfway and led the rest of the 30-lap main event.

""I hated to see that caution because I don't think (Pearson) realized the top was getting any good yet. I just kind of committed to the top there. It bit me on Sunday by picking the bottom ... we raced side-by-side what felt like forever"" Erb said. ""I knew I needed to do something different here. Earl's a great racer. He's been good all week. I just got enough clear of him to kind of chop him getting into (turn) one and could set my own pace from there.""

Erb stayed comfortable in command the rest of the way getting extra breathing room with seven laps remaining when he made short work of several backmarkers.

""I knew when I passed two or three (lapped cars) right there pretty good then moved to the middle"" said Erb a two-time miniseries winner last year at Arizona Speedway near Phoenix. ""I could tell I was a lot better and just the last lap slid (across the track) myself in both corners to be safe (and protect the lead).""

""You know when you're a sitting duck out there by yourself in the lead you just don't know which lane (to run). And on that restart I just went around that top that one time there"" Pearson said of the lap-12 restart. ""Anyway I found out that wasn't the place I needed to be. But anyway we went around the bottom from there on out and had to move up (in turns three and four). But Tyler was pretty good there ain't no doubt and I had to defend Pierce off. I knew he'd be around the top there. We'll work on it. ... We're getting closer and closer and the track there it's fitting my style but it's going away too fast then the top (groove) comes in.""





VIDEO: Watch highlights from Friday night at the Wild West Shootout.





Pierce was among the frontrunners again but the six-time miniseries winner is still looking for his first 2022 victory.

""I'm happy to have a solid night you know just a full night put together without anything going on. We've been (strong) all week really the whole time we've been here with as second the first night and we were going to win (Wednesday) and that other night we were good and just had some issues with the car and the motor"" he said. ""We've been there. It's going to come eventually here. We've got two nights left and if it's not tomorrow night the final night is the one we're looking forward to the 25-grand-to-win on Sunday night. Hopefully we can lock that one up.""

The main event's lone caution appeared on the 12th lap when third-running Brandon Sheppard abruptly slowed with a flat right-rear tire triggering a backstretch scramble that sent Jeff Schildmeyer for a spin.

The flat tire ended Sheppard's chance for the $100000 five-victory bonus that was part of the Penske Racing Shocks $300000 Paydirt Jackpot. Sheppard a two-race winner last weekend still has a crack at $25000 if he can win the final two miniseries events.

Wednesday's winner Garrett Alberson of Las Cruces won a heat race and started fourth but he never contended up front and faded to an eighth-place finish.

Miniseries competitors return to action Saturday for a 40-lap feature paying $5000-to-win while Sunday's 50-lapper finale puts $25000 up for grabs.

Notes: Mike Marlar avoided a couple of near-disasters. He nearly spun trying to avoid Brandon Sheppard's slowing car at the turn-two exit on the 12th lap then he got up into the turn-one wall briefly on the 18th lap. ... Sixteen of 24 starters finished on the lead lap. ... Earl Pearson Jr.'s team overcame a busted radiator hose in hot laps and time trials. ... Brothers Johnny Scott (improving nine positions) and Stormy Scott (starting 15th and finishing sixth) made strong charges toward the front.",,,,,,,,,,,,

EL PASO Texas – A push in the fourth quarter was not enough for the Old Dominion women's basketball team in a 53-48 loss at UTEP on Saturday afternoon. The Monarchs trailed by as many as 11 in the second half but twice tied the score in the fourth quarter only for the Miners to score the last five points of the game to end ODU's nine-game winning streak.



""Yes we knew the streak would eventually end"" head coach DeLisha Milton-Jones said. ""I'm just upset that it ended this way with us basically giving the game away. On the defensive end we had too many breakdowns too many players going rogue and lacking discipline.""



ODU (11-3 1-1 C-USA) entered the fourth quarter down 39-30 and netted the first eight points of the period with seven of those eight coming from Iggy Allen. Allen's jumper with 7:21 to play made it a 39-38 score but UTEP (10-4 2-2) responded with a 3-pointer to push its lead to 42-38. After that Miner triple the Monarchs scored the next four points by way of the foul line with Amari Young and then Brianna Jackson making both of their attempts from the charity stripe.



Jackson's second free throw knotted the score at 42-all with 5:52 left on the clock but the Miners scored the next four. Trailing by four Kaye Clark converted a layup then tied up Adhel Tac on the next possession giving the ball back to the Monarchs. ODU took advantage of the opportunity with Young scoring on a jumper to tie the game at 48-48 with 2:32 left to go.



""Sticking together as a team is what brought us back in the fourth quarter"" Mariah Adams said.



Young's bucket was the last of the game for the Monarchs as ODU turned it over on the next three possessions. In that span Katia Gallegos converted an old-fashioned three-point play to give the Miners the lead for good and Teal Battle tacked on two more at the line.



Allen came alive in the fourth quarter scoring seven of her nine points on 3-of-5 shooting.



ODU led by a pair after a low-scoring first quarter. The Monarchs opened the game with four unanswered and were still up four at 6-2 with 4:34 left in the quarter. After that ODU went scoreless for 3:39 allowing the Miners to take their first lead of the game at 7-6. Joy Campbell ended the scoreless stretch with a 3-pointer inside the final minute giving ODU a 9-7 lead after 10 minutes.



The two sides traded blows throughout the second quarter. Ajah Wayne tied the score at 13-13 with 3:10 left in the half but UTEP closed out the half on a 7-2 run which was highlighted by a pair of treys. The Miners shot 5-of-9 (.556) in the second quarter and made both shots from deep.



UTEP sustained its run into the third quarter building its largest lead of the game at 28-17 with 6:17 left in the period. ODU made just one of its first six attempts from the floor to start the second half before a quick 5-0 run made it a six-point game. The Miners soon rebuilt a 10-point edge before a pair of Young foul shots and an Aziah Hudson bucket made it 36-30 with 15 seconds to play but UTEP knocked down a trey as time expired to make it 39-30 heading into the fourth.



After shooting 7-for-25 (.281) in the first half the Monarchs shot 50 percent in the second half including a 6-of-10 mark in the fourth quarter. For the game Old Dominion made 19 of its 49 attempts (.388) and was 2-of-11 from behind the arc.



""The things we were trying to stress in the first half we were finally able to implement in the second half"" Milton-Jones said. ""We made some adjustments and were able to find direct line passes to our bigs or open gaps for our guards to exploit with drives or shots.""



UTEP shot 42 percent for the game becoming the fourth opponent to shoot 40 percent or better against the Monarchs.



Six Monarchs scored between six and nine points led by Allen's nine. Adams scored eight to go with five rebounds four steals and three assists. Kaye Clark chipped in seven on 3-of-6 shooting. Amari Young had six points and now has 999 in her career.



Battle led UTEP with 15 points and eight rebounds but did commit eight turnovers. As a team the Miners turned it over 20 times on Saturday.



The Monarchs face a short turnaround and host Florida Atlantic on Monday at 1:30 p.m.



""We cannot wait to be back at Chartway Arena"" Milton-Jones said. ""We're going to have a tough game but we'll be ready for it. Hopefully we can get on another win streak but the most important win is the next one.""

Duke head football coach Mike Elko announced Saturday thatwill join the Blue Devil program and serve as the pass game coordinator. Burden will also coach Duke's wide receivers.He comes to Durham following a one-year stint as the wide receivers coach at the University of Maryland. During his time in College Park Burden helped coach the Terrapins to a 7-6 record including a 54-10 victory over Virginia Tech in the 2021 New Era Pinstripe Bowl.In addition he mentored two All-Big Ten selections and had six receivers register 300-plus yards during his lone season. Wide out Rakim Jarrett led the team and finished ninth in the Big Ten in receiving yards with 829 while his 62 receptions and five receiving touchdowns placed him seventh and 10th in the conference respectively. Burden also coached senior Dontay Demus Jr. last season before he suffered a season-ending injury. Demus Jr. had 28 receptions for 507 yards and three touchdowns in just five games and at the time of his injury he led the Big Ten and stood 11th in the country in receiving yards.Prior to that Burden founded G.A.M.E. Academy in 2020 which provided football training to high school and middle school athletes in a safe environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The organization also helped families and student-athletes navigate the recruiting process and provided tutoring for the SAT and ACT tests.Burden coached at Virginia Tech University for five seasons (2015-19) serving the last four as the running backs coach. He also mentored the wide receivers for the 2015 season. The Hokies won 40 games in Burden's five seasons in Blacksburg including an ACC Coastal Division title in 2016. He helped Virginia Tech appear in five consecutive bowl games and was instrumental in its recruiting efforts helping put together three top-30 classes according to 247Sports.com.Virginia Tech averaged over 170 rushing yards per game in each of Burden's four seasons as the Hokies running backs coach. In 2018 Burden oversaw the rushing quartet of running backs Steven Peoples Deshawn McClease Jalen Holsten and Terius Wheatley a foursome that combined for 332 carries and 1626 yards (4.9 avg.) with 11 rushing touchdowns.A record-setting collegiate receiver in his own right at Virginia Military Academy Burden helped develop current Miami Dolphins wideout Isaiah Ford into Virginia Tech's first receiver to ever produce a 1000-yard season in 2015 when he set a single-season school record with 1164 yards including a 12-catch 227-yard effort in the Independence Bowl.Prior to Virginia Tech Burden had two stints at Old Dominion University the most recent as the Monarchs' pass game and recruiting coordinator/wide receivers coach from 2012-14. While there he groomed three 1000-yard wideouts in Antonio Vaughan (2014) Larry Pinkard (2013) and Nick Mayers (2012).Under Burden Old Dominion was one of only 13 FBS schools in 2014 to have three players with 40 or more catches and one of 16 schools to have four players with 30 or more receptions. Vaughan produced his best collegiate season with 63 catches for a league-high 1019 yards with his 12 touchdowns tying for fourth among all FCS programs.With Burden serving as passing game coordinator in 2013 Old Dominion ranked fourth in the FCS in scoring offense (42.3 ppg) fourth in passing offense (359.4 ypg) and seventh in total offense (519.0 ypg) as Pinkard led the squad with 68 catches for 1020 yards.He helped lead the most prolific FCS offense in 2012 as the Monarchs led the nation in scoring (45.2 ppg) total offense (548.2 ypg) passing offense (393.8 ypg) and touchdown passes (44). Old Dominion claimed the CAA title that year and advanced to the FCS NCAA quarterfinals. Under Burden's guidance Mayers tied for second among FCS performers with a school-record 16 touchdown catches. He also set single-season school records with 79 catches for 1233 yards earning All-America honors from College Sports Madness and Beyond Sports Network.In his one season at the University of Richmond in 2011 Burden developed wide receiver Tre Gray into a record-setting wideout. He earned Third Team All-America honors from the Associated Press after leading the Colonial Athletic Association and setting the Spiders' single-season records with 95 receptions for 1187 yards.During his first stop at Old Dominion from 2007-10 Burden served as the defensive backs coach helping to build a roster from scratch. By the time the Monarchs got on the field in 2009 they produced a 9-2 mark the best record for a first-year program in the modern era of college football.Burden began his coaching career in 2006 at Fork Union Military Academy where he coached wide receivers and the secondary while also serving as the passing game coordinator and recruiting liaison. While with the Blue Devils he worked with eventual first-round NFL draft picks in defensive back Kareem Jackson and offensive tackle Anthony Castonzo.

A Campaign analysis of Bloomberg data shows a strong recovery from the pandemic drove up share prices by double-digit percentages across the agency sector last year after the advertising slump in 2020.

IPG which reported organic revenue growth during 2021 that was well ahead of 2019 levels saw a 59% increase in its share price to $37.60 and the US-listed group ended the year with a valuation of about $14.75bn (£10.8bn).

IPG’s total shareholder return (TSR) – a key measure for investors because it also includes dividend payments – rose 65% during Philippe Krakowsky’s first year as chief executive and Michael Roth’s final year as chairman.

Publicis Groupe was the next best performer as its share price rose 45% to €59.20 valuing the French company at €15bn ($17.1bn or £12.6bn). TSR was up 51%.

WPP was close behind as its share price rose 40% to £11.20 giving the British company a valuation of £12.9bn ($17.7bn). TSR was up 44%.

Publicis and WPP’s share price performances were almost identical at constant currency levels which take into account the euro’s decline of about 5% in value against sterling in 2021.

Omnicom which suffered the steepest organic revenue declines in 2020 and recovered more slowly than its three biggest peers in 2021 saw its share price increase by 17% to $73.70 and TSR by 22%.

Omnicom’s relative weakness resulted in the US-based holding company losing its crown as the world’s most valuable agency group as it slipped to third place by stock market capitalisation during autumn 2021 and ended the year with a $15.6bn valuation.

Publicis Groupe and WPP overtook Omnicom by market cap during autumn 2021 – with WPP pulling ahead as the biggest by stock market capitalisation by the year-end.

Overall the combined value of the big four agency groups – WPP Publicis Groupe Omnicom and IPG – increased by more than one third to reach $65bn Campaign estimates.

“A way forward for the agency holding company model”

Japan’s Dentsu the fifth largest agency group which struggled in the run-up to the pandemic and during the 2020 slump also did better in 2021 as its share price rose 34%.

Havas the smallest of the big six agency groups does not have a stock market listing because it is a subsidiary of French media giant Vivendi.

S4 Capital one of a new breed of digital-focused “challenger” groups saw its stock price rise 26% in 2021 after a strong 2020 when it increased about 150%.

M&C Saatchi was one of the best-performing small agency groups last year doubling its share price to 168.5p after drawing a line under an accounting scandal that dogged the company for nearly 18 months. Vin Murria the top shareholder subsequently made a takeover approach at the start of this year.

Many investors were bearish about traditional agency holding companies in the run-up to the pandemic and at the start of the crisis but revenue from advertising and marketing services held up better than expected and agency groups were able to speed up restructuring simplify operations and cut costs.

In an interview with Campaign in December Krakowsky said of IPG's sustained growth: “Our performance in the last few years has been the indicator that there might be a way forward [for the agency holding company model].”

In an interview this week Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo linked yet another industry to the problem drawing a “direct correlation” between inflation and the shortage of semiconductors the computer chips needed to manufacture automobiles.

Indeed the automobile sector has been a major cause of inflation in the last 12 months: Between December 2020 and December 2021 the prices for new vehicles jumped 11.8% and the prices of used cars rose an astounding 37.3%.

The inflation for all items was 7% the fastest year-over year increase since 1982.

The auto price jumps stem largely from a decline in production “because car companies can't get their hands on enough chips” according to Raimondo who added that business leaders agree with the assessment.

“We need to increase the supply of cars so prices will come down. In order to do that we need an increase in semiconductor chips” Raimondo told Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief Andy Serwer.

A ‘really scary’ problem

The chip shortage is not just hurting pocketbooks — it's a national security concern according to Raimondo a former governor of Rhode Island.

“If you ever have time for a really scary read [look at] how dependent the United States is on other countries especially Taiwan for our supply of semiconductors” she said.

The U.S. role in semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to 12% today according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association. The situation is even worse with the world’s most advanced logic semiconductors 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019.

Raimondo has pointed to a need for transparency in the industry noting there are times where “suppliers wonder who's hoarding who's stockpiling.""

‘We need Congress to act’

So how does the U.S. solve its semiconductor problem?

""We need Congress to act"" Raimondo says. “It's stalled in Congress to be very honest.”

The CHIPS for America Act — which passed the Senate last June and awaits a vote in the House — includes $52 billion to prod semiconductor companies to base fabrication plants in the U.S. If lawmakers send the money Raimondo said her Department will “work in partnership with semiconductor companies asking them to set up shop in America making chips in America.”

That program would reach out to American semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NVDA) Intel (INTC) and Micron (MU) as well as foreign companies “in allied countries” like Samsung and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Story continues

“We want them and need them to build in America hiring Americans to make this stuff on our shores” Raimondo said.

Heading into the midterm elections inflation is a front-burner issue for voters: A recent AP-NORC poll shows voters have grown more concerned with inflation and less worried about the coronavirus. And in bad news for the Biden administration another poll finds three in five voters pin the blame on the president over corporate America.

The DLI scheme was launched in December and is being managed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information technology (MeitY). It aims to provide financial incentives and design infrastructure support to companies engaged in semiconductor design and development.

Domestic companies startups and MSMEs in various stages of development and deployment of semiconductor design for integrated circuits (ICs) chipsets system on chips (SoCs) systems and IP Cores and semiconductor linked design stand to benefit from the scheme for the next five years.

The scheme is a part of Rs 76000 crore ($10 billion) booster package that the government announced with the target of nurturing at least 20 semiconductor design domestic companies and facilitate them to achieve turnover of more than Rs 1500 crore in the next five years.

What's this DLI scheme?

According to a MeitY press release C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) a scientific society operating under MeitY will serve as the nodal agency for implementation of the DLI scheme.

The scheme has three components – Chip Design infrastructure support Product Design Linked Incentive and Deployment Linked Incentive.

The government said that under the Chip Design infrastructure support C-DAC will setup the India Chip Centre to host the state-of-the-art design infrastructure and facilitate its access to supported companies.

Under the DLI Scheme financial incentives and design infrastructure support will be extended to domestic companies start-ups and MSMEs across various stages of development and deployment of semiconductor design for Integrated Circuits (ICs) chipsets System on Chips (SoCs) systems and IP cores and semiconductor linked design for over a period of five years.

The ministry has created a dedicated portal -- www.chips-dli.gov.in -- for inviting online applications from January 1 2022 to December 31 2024.

The scheme will have three components -- chip design infrastructure support product design linked incentive and deployment linked incentive. The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) a scientific society operating under MeitY will serve as the nodal agency for implementation of the DLI scheme.

Under the chip design infrastructure support C-DAC will set up 'India Chip Centre' to host the state-of-the-art design infrastructure (viz. EDA Tools IP Cores and support for MPW (Multi Project Wafer fabrication) and post-silicon validation) and facilitate its access to supported companies. Under the product design linked incentive component a reimbursement of up to 50 per cent of the eligible expenditure subject to a ceiling of Rs 15 crore per application will be provided as fiscal support to the approved applicants who are engaged in semiconductor design.

Under the deployment linked incentive component an incentive of 6 per cent to 4 per cent of net sales turnover over five years subject to a ceiling of Rs 30 crore per application will be provided to approved applicants whose semiconductor design for ICs chipsets SoCs systems and IP cores and semiconductor linked design are deployed in electronic products.

A press release issued by the ministry said that the approved applicants that claim incentives under the scheme will be encouraged to retain their domestic status (i.e. more than 50 per cent of the capital in it is beneficially owned by resident Indian citizens and/ or Indian companies which are ultimately owned and controlled by resident Indian citizens) for a period of three years after claiming incentives under the scheme.

An applicant must meet the threshold and ceiling limits to be eligible for disbursement of incentives under the scheme.

The DLI scheme will also take a graded and pre-emptive approach to identify the products of national priorities and implement strategies for their complete or near complete indigenisation and deployment thereby taking steps towards import substitution and value addition in strategic and societal sectors.

The DLI scheme is a part of the Rs 76000-crore ($10 billion) package through which the government aims to bring up at least 20 domestic companies involved in semiconductor design and facilitate them to achieve turnover of more than Rs 1500 crore in the next five years.

Details | Mint,"The Centre has invited applications from domestic companies start-ups and MSMEs under its Design Linked Incentive (DLI) Scheme to create a vibrant ecosystem for semiconductor chip design in the country.

Under the DLI scheme financial incentives and design infrastructure support will be extended to domestic companies startups and MSMEs across various stages of development and deployment of semiconductor design for Integrated Circuits (ICs) chipsets system on chips (SoCs) systems & IP cores and semiconductor linked design for over a period of 5 years.

The scheme which was a part of ₹76000 crore ($10 billion) package that the government announced in December aims to nurture at least 20 domestic companies involved in semiconductor design and facilitating them to achieve turnover of more than ₹1500 Crore in the next 5 years the Ministry of Electronics & IT said in a statement.

According to the statement C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) a scientific society operating under MeitY will serve as the nodal agency for implementation of the DLI scheme.

The scheme has three components – chip design infrastructure support product design-linked incentive and deployment linked incentive.

Under the chip design infrastructure support the C-DAC will setup the India Chip Centre to host the state-of-the-art design infrastructure and facilitate its access to supported companies.

Under the design-linked incentive component a reimbursement of up to 50% of the eligible expenditure subject to a ceiling of ₹15 crore per application will be provided as fiscal support to the approved applicants who are engaged in semiconductor design.

Under the deployment component an incentive of 6% to 4% of net sales turnover over 5 years subject to a ceiling of ₹30 Crore per application will be provided to approved applicants whose semiconductor design for Integrated Circuits (ICs) Chipsets System on Chips (SoCs) Systems & IP Cores and semiconductor linked design are deployed in electronic products.

The approved applicants that claim incentives under the scheme will be encouraged to retain their domestic status (i.e. more than 50% of the capital in it is beneficially owned by resident Indian citizens and/ or Indian companies which are ultimately owned and controlled by resident Indian citizens) for a period of three years after claiming incentives under the scheme.

A dedicated portal has been made available – www.chips-dli.gov.in - for inviting Online applications from January 1 2022 to December 31 2024. The applicants can find the guidelines of the DLI Scheme on the portal and register themselves for availing support under the scheme.

Bess who is an investor in Sepio and had joined its advisory board in 2020 has succeeded Tamir Pardo former Director of the Mossad and president of XM Cyber who served as Chairman for the past four years.

“I feel very privileged to take on this role at such a crucial time for the cyber security industry” said Bess. “Demand for Sepio's HAC-1 solution is rapidly growing because no other technology uses physical layer fingerprinting to provide risk management and full visibility into the infrastructure and identify rogue devices which can be used to inject ransomware and malware and steal data.”

Aboard the spaceship was a Sepio-branded rubber ducky acknowledging his new role as Chairman.

""On behalf of the Sepio Board I would like to thank my friend Tamir for his contributions to the company's growth and success over the years"" said Sepio CEO and co-founder Yossi Appleboum. ""The team is looking forward to working with Lane to elevate the company to even greater successes. He is extremely motivated and passionate and we appreciate his strong belief in our company.”

That was cold Shauna.

Showtime put Twitter sensation Yellowjackets on ice Sunday with a chilling season one finale that was stuffed with reveals and paved the way for a hiatus filled with even more fan theories about Lottie as well as a debate about what we define as being “real.”

Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson the husband-and-wife showrunning duo opened up about the finale in an hourlong interview with THR’s TV’s Top 5 podcast and responded to scores of theories about the first season of the survivalist thriller in a special Showrunner Spotlight interview. (Listen to the full interview below.)

The conversation opens with a discussion about perhaps the biggest over-arching question about Yellowjackets: if the show has a supernatural component. To hear Nickerson tell it that question is best answered with another question: “What does it mean for something to be supernatural or something to be ‘real’?” he told TV’s Top 5 hosts Lesley Goldberg and Daniel Fienberg. “People have experiences that are beyond what we’d call normal reality. What exactly those experiences are is something you can debate. … What exactly is happening is as much about the character and the audience’s belief system however it may shift or change as it is about what is actually happening.”

As for the shocking finale the 1996-set storyline revealed that Jackie (Ella Purnell) froze to death after being kicked out of the cabin following a fight with her BFF Shauna (Sophie Nelisse). Lottie (Courtney Eaton) aka the Antler Queen has another “premonition” come true and is able to provide food for the team after brutally killing a bear. Meanwhile in the present-day storyline Natalie (Juliette Lewis) is moments from suicide before being kidnapped by people wearing the symbol who are somehow connected to adult Lottie.

“We felt something inevitable to us about [Jackie’s] death and this form of her death; it was a North Star” Lyle says confirming that on a Purnell will likely be back as “Jackie is a character who looms large over everyone else’s lives.”

As for adult Lottie Lyle and Nickerson say the role has yet to be cast but it’s one of a few surviving Yellowjackets whom viewers should expect to meet in the present-day storyline in the previously announced second season. Adult Ali — the Yellowjacket whose leg Taissa (Jasmin Savoy Brown) broke in the pilot — will also be among those expected to return. “In terms of other survivors we plant the flag that Lottie is lurking in the shadows and meeting her in the near future. Ideally we will probably meet at least one other” Lyle says.

Interest in Yellowjackets exploded over the holidays as fan theories made for popular discourse on Reddit and countless other websites. The creators say they’re both impressed and surprised by viewers’ “wild creativity” and love of “book club” memes. While the finale did not shed light on many of the biggest debates Lyle and Nickerson shot down a number of theories during the interview. Here’s a quick rundown:

• Is Adam (Peter Gadiot) the baby 1996 Shauna was carrying? “That is not true” Lyle confirms.

• Is Adam adult Javi (Luciano Leroux)? “No” Lyle confirms. “We want the viewers to be in the mindset of our characters. One thing about trauma and PTSD it poisons how you see the the world in terms of paranoia and not being able to trust people. … What we were intending was for people to question that relationship.”

• Did Taissa attack Van (Liv Hewson) in the wilderness instead of a wolf? “Tai was not the one who attacked Van instead of a wolf” Lyle says.

• Is Jackie a time traveler? The list of her favorite movies that she listed in her journal includes some that came out after her death in 1996. “Jackie is not a time traveler” Nickerson says. Adds Lyle: “I’m surprised by the extent people are second-guessing that Jackie is dead. … The survivor’s guilt that Shauna feels once they are rescued is something we’d love to explore later on in the show; those things tie together neatly.”

• Did someone signal the girls to lure them to the cabin? Nickerson responds to that theory by reiterating the need to question what viewers define as being real.

• Did the Yellowjackets eat Shauna’s baby? “From a purely practical standpoint a baby doesn’t seem like sustainable nutrition” Lyle says with a laugh. “But the question of what happens to her baby is something we have presented and a question we will eventually answer.”

Looking ahead Lyle and Nickerson — who previously previewed the road to Yellowjackets in a November interview with TV’s Top 5 — are already diving into writing season two with the expansion of the show’s writers room drawing interest from hundreds of scribes in town. The creators hope the wait for season two “won’t be too terribly long” though a return date has not yet been announced given the current challenges associated with filming during the pandemic.

The central role of season two Lyle says will be exploring “what you do and do not believe in particularly in the wilderness” as the concept of what we decide to believe in or not has been a guiding theme of the entire show. “How does it change our behavior and influence what we are or aren’t willing to do?” she says. “To our minds it’s not about any religiosity which throughout culture and time has been such an insanely informative part of human society. We’re going to take these characters and in a personal way examine their own belief system.”

A great example of that exploration is Taissa who in the ’96 storyline is the most skeptical of the Yellowjackets and a self-proclaimed atheist. Viewers know the young and adult Tai has a penchant for eating dirt and in the finale seems to have sacrificed her family’s dog in order to win her local election. “The idea of offerings and sacrifices is as old as humans are” Lyle notes as the finale also sees young Lottie offer the bear’s heart to an altar constructed during the insanity of Doomcoming.

When it comes to the two mystery men featured in the opening credits and in the finale — the “No Eyed Man” and the young guy Shauna sees in her dream who notes he was waiting for Jackie Lyle says both figures are an “interpretation of what’s happening.” “We’re circling right back into what’s supernatural — what is real and the subjectivity of that” she says. “The question becomes ‘Is that a real presence?’”

The worldwide total through Sunday is an Electro-fying $1.625B.

Notably during the frame this Spidey scaled new heights in Latin America becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in Mexico ($72M cume) and the No. 2 movie ever in Brazil ($50.4M) Central America ($12.6M) and Ecuador ($7.9M).

The Tom Holland-fronted phenom also crossed $100M globally in IMAX with an estimated $101.2M through Monday. This is only the 11th title in the company’s history to the milestone. Overseas markets make up $40.7M of the total.

Still to come are Slovakia and Norway as Peter Parker and friends eye a potential $1B overseas sans China. Superheroes (and horror see below) are uniting factors at cinemas and there’s not much new coming up on a global scale until Roland Emmerich’s Moonfall begins offshore rollout on February 3.

Paramount In the meantime Paramount/Spyglass Media’s Scream got off to a strong start at the international box office with $18M from 50 markets. On a like-for-like basis the re-quel’s results are 23% above Scream 4 and 57% above recent horror release Halloween Kills. Combined with domestic’s (three-day) launch the global running total is $48.6M through Sunday.

The Matt Bettinelli-Olpin/Tyler Gillett-directed return to Woodsboro landed No. 2 in the majority of its offshore openings including the UK ($3.4M/622 locations) France ($1.8M/415) Australia ($1.5M/229) Russia ($1.3M/1500 — biggest debut in the franchise) and Germany ($1.1M/452). The UAE opened at No. 1 with $310K from 66 sites.

Warner Bros Elsewhere Warner Bros’ The Matrix Resurrections traveled to China this weekend taking the No. 1 spot there (the first time for a Hollywood film since No Time To Die in October) with RMB 47.9M ($7.5M). That’s roughly on par with Blade Runner 2049. The film has a 7.5 on Maoyan which is projecting a $15M+ finish. IMAX generated $1.3M repping over 15% of the nationwide weekend.

In 78 markets overall Matrix grossed $11.1M to cross the century mark with $104.2M overseas. The worldwide running total is now $140M. Top hubs are Japan ($11.8M) the UK ($9.3M) Russia ($8M) China ($7.5M) and France ($7.4M).

Also debuting in China this session Paramount’s Paw Patrol: The Movie landed No. 5 with RMB 22.9M ($3.6M). Disney holdover Encanto has cumed $6.5M in the market.

Disney/20th Century Studios’ The King’s Man had a $10.2M frame in 44 overseas markets for an international cume of $63.8M and a global cume of $92.5M through Sunday. The hold was -47% versus last weekend. Russia was a No. 1 launch with $2.2M. The UK leads play at $8.7M followed by Korea ($8.2M) Japan ($7.2M) France ($5.2M) and Taiwan ($4.6M).

There are major markets still to come including Germany the UK and Japan.

In local-language the Disney co-produced and distributed The Last Warriror: Emissary Of Darkness has become the highest grossing title within the franchise in Russia having grossed $28.2M to date.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vcHVjay5uZXdzL2phbWllLXZzLXRoZS1jcnlwdG8tYnVsbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jamie vs. the Crypto Bulls - Puck,"SHARE

You don’t need to watch that ridiculous Matt Damon commercial on loop to understand that the crypto markets have been on fire. Venture firms in particular are placing huge new bets on the crypto market: FTX the crypto exchange just launched a $2 billion fund competing with similarly sized funds from a16z ($2.2 billion) and Paradigm ($2.5 billion) last year. On the other side however Jamie Dimon says “cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value” and called bitcoin “worthless.”

There are a couple of different things going on here. The VCs are focused on the Next Big Thing and believe that the blockchain technologies behind digital currencies smart contracts and NFTs will lead to a whole new architecture for the Internet and a wave of important new businesses that could become the next Google Amazon or Meta. They are raising these big funds or have already raised them with the intention of placing lots of bets on what they hope this future will look like."

No matter who's playing the game most can agree that Super Bowl commercials and game-day food are essential pieces of the championship. This year PepsiCo is getting started on its famous Super Bowl commercials early with a ""Road to the Super Bowl LVI"" ad featuring some of the biggest names in NFL history.

The first ballers you'll recognize are the Manning brothers Peyton and Eli. The former quarterbacks are seen sitting on a couch bickering as siblings do surrounded by snacks and beverages from the Frito Lay/PepsiCo family (via YouTube). This year the retired brothers would both be watching from the sidelines or the family couch. Eli played his last game in 2019 while older brother Peyton in 2016.

But the commercial doesn't end with the funny Manning brothers. Former Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis crashes through the door like the Kool-Aid man trying to get the brothers to join him on a road trip. The Hall of Famer nicknamed ""The Bus"" per WTHR convinces the brothers to come outside where ""The Bus's Bus"" is parked.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvdGF0b3Byby5jb20vZXMvbmV3cy8yMDIyL2xheXMtaW50cm9kdWNlcy13YWZlci1zdHlsZS10aGlubmVzdC1jaGlwLWhvdXNlLWxheXPSAVtodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3RhdG9wcm8uY29tL2VzL25ld3MvMjAyMi9sYXlzLWludHJvZHVjZXMtd2FmZXItc3R5bGUtdGhpbm5lc3QtY2hpcC1ob3VzZS1sYXlz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lay's introduces 'Wafer Style' the thinnest potato chip from the house of Lay's,"""As market leaders we at Lay’s continue to bring exciting category innovations that are attuned to the evolving preferences of the consumers.

According to Vatican sources the Holy Father twice met Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the Vatican although the precise details are not known.

Unlike most papal private audiences these meetings were not announced by the Holy See Press Office which did not respond to repeated requests to confirm the meetings.

A Pfizer spokesman said “We can’t confirm or deny as per our policy the movements of our executives are considered confidential.”

Bourla’s meetings with the Pope would not be the first such unannounced papal encounter in recent years. In November 2019 shortly before the COVID-19 health emergency began the Pope privately received Melinda Gates. The meeting well known in the Vatican was not announced and has never been officially acknowledged.

Last May Bourla took part in an online Vatican health conference titled “Unite to Prevent & Unite to Cure” that included a significant focus on COVID-19 treatments and prevention as well as providing a platform for promoting vaccines produced by large pharmaceutical companies.

Other speakers at the meeting co-hosted by the Pontifical Council for Culture included Stephane Bancel the CEO of Moderna another large anti-COVID-19 vaccine producer Dr. Anthony Fauci President Joe Biden’s chief medical officer and Dr. Francis Collins then director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

First to Use Pfizer

Vatican City State was one of the first authorities to administer vaccines after it signed a contract with Pfizer in late 2020 to exclusively offer its Pfizer-BioNTech pharmaceutical product to its staff. The first inoculations were rolled out in early 2021.

A strong proponent of the vaccine in light of what it believes is a “continuation and worsening of the current health emergency” the Vatican has been mandating the Pfizer injection for all staff and visitors since Dec. 23.

From Jan. 31 triple vaccination (two doses plus the booster) will be required to enter Vatican territory. (Proof of recent recovery from COVID-19 can also gain admittance and there are no requirements for public liturgies and general audiences.)

But the mandates have been imposed when effectiveness of all the COVID-19 vaccines at preventing spread of the disease is being questioned.

In December 2020 professor Andrea Arcangeli director of the Vatican’s Health and Hygiene Directorate said the Vatican chose to use the Pfizer vaccine because in clinical trials it had “been shown to be 95% effective.” He added that “subsequently other vaccines produced with different methods can be introduced after evaluating their effectiveness and full safety.”

The 95% figure means that vaccinated people had a 95% lower risk of getting COVID-19 compared with the control group participants in trials who weren’t vaccinated. So in other words Pfizer was telling the public that in its own clinical trial vaccinated people were 20 times less likely than the control group to get COVID-19.

However in a Jan. 10 interview with Yahoo News Bourla acknowledged that the first two doses of the vaccine are now largely ineffective against the spread of the Omicron variant and that although Omicron is “milder” than previous variants because of the high infection rates hospitalizations have been “going much higher in terms of severe disease ICU occupation etc.”

“We know that the two doses of the vaccine have very limited protection if any” Bourla told Yahoo News. “The three doses with the booster offer reasonable protection against hospitalization and death.”

Cases Continue Despite Vaccination

Despite the original 95% effectivity rate against the earlier variants that prompted the Vatican to sign a contract with Pfizer Vatican personnel have been continuing to contract COVID-19 in the Vatican over the past year despite being double- or triple-vaccinated. The latest case is that of Bishop Brian Farrell secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity who is currently infected with COVID-19 despite having received the booster shot.

An official at the Pontifical Council told the Register this morning “he has tested positive but we expect him back in the office next week.”

Vatican sources have also told the Register that as many as 14 Swiss Guards contracted COVID-19 in the second half of last year but the cases were never reported. All of them had had two Pfizer doses but almost no symptoms.

The Vatican has reported no cases of hospitalizations or deaths since the vaccine rollout and throughout the pandemic no COVID-19 deaths have been reported in Vatican City.

However since the vaccine program began in early 2021 the Holy See Press Office has ceased reporting new cases of COVID-19 in contrast to 2020 when it regularly announced if any personnel or residents had been tested positive for the virus.

The last reported Vatican staff to be infected were Cardinal Giuseppe Bertello then the president of Vatican City State and the papal almoner Cardinal Konrad Krajewski in December 2020. Both survived the disease.

Despite concerns about the Pfizer vaccine being tainted by abortion Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin appeared this week to rule out any conscience exemption right.

He told the Register that Vatican employees seeking an exemption because they oppose the vaccine’s link to abortion “seems not to be justified” as the Pfizer product was only tested rather than produced using the cell lines derived from abortion.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has also caused adverse side effects including heart ailments and blood clotting especially in younger recipients with some causing death. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention insists these “reports are rare and the known and potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks [of these side effects].”

Thousands of these and other cases have nevertheless been reported on government sites in various countries (see the UK figures for the Pfizer vaccine here) where suspected side effects can be voluntarily reported and citizens have created websites to record their own testimonies of adverse effects from all COVID-19 vaccines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9wcm9mb290YmFsbHRhbGsvcnVtb3ItbWlsbC9uZXdzL2JhcnQtc2NvdHQtdGVsbHMtam9zaC1hbGxlbi10by11c2UtdmlhZ3JhLXRvLWltcHJvdmUtY2lyY3VsYXRpb24tcGZpemVyLWFkdmlzZXMtb3RoZXJ3aXNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bart Scott tells Josh Allen to use Viagra to improve circulation; Pfizer advises otherwise,"At a time when one specific Pfizer product has gotten the bulk of public attention its signature blue pill has been mentioned a time or two in the past few days as it relates to playing football in cold weather.

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Smith becomes the third notable transfer the Red Storm have landed this offseason joining 7-foot-1 center Vincent Iwuchukwu from USC and 6-foot-7 forward Aaron Scott from North Texas. They both committed last month.

At point guard St. John's also returns sophomore Simeon Wilcher a touted recruit who began to show marked improvement late last season in his limited role as a freshman. Wilcher averaged 2.8 points and 9.1 minutes in 28 games as Jenkins' understudy.

Jenkins followed Pitino from Iona to St. John's for his senior season and propelled the Red Storm to a 20-13 record including 11-9 in conference play for their most Big East wins in 14 years. They reached the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2000 losing 95-90 to eventual NCAA champion UConn.

Jenkins led the team in scoring (14.9 points per game) assists (5.4) steals (1.6) and minutes (30.7) earning second-team All-Big East honors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvamF6ei9uZXdzL2VuZC1zZWFzb24tZ3JhZGVzLWV2YWx1YXRpbmctamF6ei1rZXlvbnRlLWdlb3JnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,End of Season Grades: Evaluating Jazz PG Keyonte George,"Despite the Utah Jazz going just 31-51 on the year there were plenty of memorable and enjoyable pieces to the season. One of the brightest was Keyonte George the rookie out of Baylor who burst onto the scene from day one and seized the Jazz starting point guard role.

It’s hard to expect any more from the 20-year-old who was taken with the 16th pick in last summer's draft. George averaged 13.0 points 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Jazz. Those numbers were good for fourth in scoring and second in total assists amongst all rookies this year. The passing in particular was a lot better than advertised after not being asked to do much of that while at Baylor.

George’s scoring remains the most intriguing piece of his game. He recorded three games in which he scored over 30 points and went over 20 points in nine others. When he’s playing confidently he can get buckets from all three levels and has plenty of juice from long-range. On February 15 George etched his name into the record books when he knocked down nine three-pointers which tied him for the rookie record and put him all alone for Jazz rookies.

An underrated storyline from the season was the leadership role the rookie took on as the season progressed. Jazz head coach Will Hardy thrust him into the starting point guard role early on and along with this came added responsibility- a responsibility that George seemed comfortable with. Heading into his first full offseason George will have even more of an opportunity to be a leader for this Jazz team that is looking to improve.

Despite all the positives it wasn’t a perfect season for George. He like the Jazz's other guards struggled with efficiency. There was a point in the middle of March where George seemed to have figured out how to get to his spots and score more efficiently but those numbers dipped as his teammates missed games and his name became more prominent on opposing scouting reports. Judging by his end-of-season comments he’s not worried about the misses. George said getting stronger and in better shape would result in the shots falling at a higher clip.

Defensively George is still a work in progress. Although his length stands out there's still plenty of room to grow. He has enough size to play either backcourt position which he used to showcase some nice individual defensive sequences. His off-ball awareness needs to improve as does his general focus on that end but he certainly has the potential to be a fine defender in this league.

One area where George can improve is in his words emotional intelligence. He’s immensely talented but he needs to keep his head up when he misses a shot or makes a silly turnover. He’s young though and there’s so much good that it’s hard to dwell on the bad.

Overall it was a very promising season for George. He’ll head into a big offseason with a lot to learn but a great foundation of skills & intelligence to build on. In a postgame press conference Hardy said that Keyonte could become the future of the Jazz program. That is high praise from his head coach but it is certainly a quote that should make you feel good as a Jazz fan.

But this time we are breaking with tradition to bring you the week’s biggest non-event: Davos.

Every year the great and the good gather in the Swiss Alps at the grandly titled World Economic Forum to give their answers to the big questions. But Covid-19 running now into its fourth calendar year has seen it called off again.

In the absence of a real-life forum this month the Observer is publishing as a public service a summary of the talks not given the panels that remained ungathered the roundtables not tabled.

Inequality after Covid-19

As coronavirus spread around the world it caused turmoil in financial markets but they quickly snapped back and US equities have hit a series of new records. Broad measures of inequality are notoriously unreliable but one obvious sign is seen right at the top with 10 “centibillionaires” – people worth more than $100bn – according to Bloomberg’s daily league table. Hosted by Davos founder Klaus Schwab engineer economist and expert in getting the world’s richest people in the same room.

Inflation

Central bankers did manage to get to their own mountain resort working holiday in the summer at Jackson Hole but since then inflation has really jumped up the agenda thanks to surging global gas prices and disruption to supply chains. So are the Fed’s Jerome Powell and the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey really willing to play the role of monetary hawks?

Hosted by Jens Weidmann the German economist who spent a decade crying wolf on inflation at the European Central Bank only for price rises to arrive just after he left.

China’s place in the world

The pandemic originated in China but as that country overtakes the US as the great global economic power will the world fall into a “Thucydides trap” and tend inexorably towards war?

Hosted by HSBC boss Noel Quinn whose bet is on Beijing if his company’s apparent willingness to overlook Chinese repression is any guide along with JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon who managed an impressive two apologies after joking that his bank would outlast China’s Communist party.

Crypto

There is no shortage of people willing to go on about how cryptocurrencies will change the world. Just ask Kazakhstan where bitcoin mining may or may not have been a factor in recent energy price protests. Candidates for a Davos panel might include El Salvador’s crypto-bro president Nayib Bukele underwear tycoon/PPE connoisseur/bitcoin enthusiast Michelle Mone and Twitter founder/payments boss/Victorian sage Jack Dorsey.

Medicine after the pandemic

The pandemic has proved a financial and public relations triumph for big pharma which has (with honourable exceptions) firmly cashed in. So what next for biotech? Hosted by noted thought leader Elizabeth Holmes alongside Jacek Olczak chief executive of cigarette maker Philip Morris International which wants to move towards net zero dead customers by buying an inhaler company.

Build Back Better

Big economics had already quietly acknowledged that fiscal austerity was a bad idea after the financial crisis but the pandemic has not so much opened the floodgates as destroyed them. Government investment is firmly back in vogue.

Who better to talk us through the implications than Joe Biden whose flagship economic policy is to “build back better” (just don’t ask how it will pass the US Senate) and Boris Johnson whose flagship economic policy is to “build back better” (just don’t ask about new trains parties energy prices tax rises etc)?",,,,,,,,,,,,
PSX,Phillips 66,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHJhdmVsL3RyYXZlbF9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTAxMzE4NzcvUm91dGUtNjYtRmFzY2luYXRpbmctcGhvdG8tYm9vay1tYXRjaGVzLXZpbnRhZ2UtcGljdHVyZXMtbW9kZXJuLXNuYXBzaG90cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Route 66 - then and now: Fascinating photo book matches vintage pictures with modern snapshots,"Advertisement

'While some businesses have survived and thrived on the Mother Road others are rusting ghost-town relics but both are equally fascinating.'

So writes publisher Pavilion of Route 66 Then and Now which compares vintage photographs of the US highway with modern pictures taken from the same angle.

The book was written by author and photographer Joe Sonderman who has spent years collecting thousands of postcards and archival images of Route 66.

It winds the clock back to the opening of Route 66 in 1926 exploring how it connected Chicago with Los Angeles over 2250 miles (3621km) away - and breathed life into the small towns and businesses along its path.

The highway was made redundant by the unveiling of the 1-40 in 1984 Sonderman reveals but state associations soon formed to keep Route 66 alive and kicking. Though many of the landmarks along the way have fallen into disrepair others have been preserved and restored to their original glory.

'Route 66 Then and Now highlights some of the most famous stop-offs along the route showing them in their prime and how they look today' the publisher adds. Scroll down to see a selection of mesmerising old and new pictures from the book...

‹ Slide me › MICHIGAN AVENUE CHICAGO THE START OF AN EPIC ROAD TRIP: The photograph on the left dates back to 1965 and was captured on the steps of the Art Institute of Chicago on Michigan Avenue - which lies right opposite the official signpost marking the start of 'Historic Route 66' on East Adams Street. The route is carried out of Chicago by Ogden Avenue which passes through the Cicero district the former home base of gangster Al Capone

‹ Slide me › CHICKEN BASKET WILLOWBROOK ILLINOIS: Cast your eye to the left and you'll see the landmark Chicken Basket Restaurant as it appeared in 1954. Located at Route 66 and 74th street in Hinsdale the eatery originally operated as a simple gas station lunch counter. However the book reveals when two local women gave owner Irv Kolarik a recipe for fried chicken business began to boom. To attract business in the winter Sonderman says that Kolarik used to flood the roof to create a temporary ice rink and hire skaters. Then Interstate 55 was constructed and the restaurant was left 'isolated on a service road'. The premises was bought by Dell Rhea and his wife for a 'bargain price' in 1963. The author says: 'They worked hard to bring back the customers. Offering some of the best fried chicken in the Chicago area the restaurant is as popular as ever.' The original sign still exists though it was restored in 2017 we learn

‹ Slide me › O'CONNELL'S SERVICE STATION ODELL ILLINOIS: Pictured to the left is O'Connell's Service station in 1940 eight years after it was opened by Patrick O'Connell. At that time Sonderman says the station stocked Phillips 66 gas a name inspired by Route 66. O'Connell designed the station to look like a house with a canopy hoping to 'make customers feel at home'. Sonderman writes: 'It became a body shop in 1967 closed in 1975 and began to deteriorate alongside the old road.' Thankfully Odell's residents grouped together to save the service station eventually purchasing it in 1999. After being restored it now serves as a welcome center the author adds

‹ Slide me › BRICK PAVEMENT AUBURN ILLINOIS: Going south from Springfield heading west Sonderman explains that the Route 66 traveller can choose between driving along the modern route or taking the 'more scenic 1926-1930 route that zigs and zags through the cornfields and small towns to Staunton'. This route is pictured to the left in 1940. Ten years before the photograph was taken Route 66 was moved further east occupying different roadways. The author reveals: 'In 1931 after Route 66 was relocated sections of the road were paved in brick to create jobs - and because a high-ranking politician owned a brick factory.' This section of brick pavement south of Chatham can still be driven today on a route that is now known as the IL 4

‹ Slide me › GATEWAY ARCH ST LOUIS A MONUMENT TO THOSE HEADING WEST: The image on the left dates back to 1936 showing the riverfront of the 'Gateway to the West' - St Louis. Though it was originally a busy hub filled with steamboats Sonderman reveals that the riverfront deteriorated by the mid-1930s and it was subsequently cleared to make way for the Gateway Arch. Construction began in 1959. The author says: 'The Gateway Arch completed in October 1965 will always dominate the skyline of St Louis. A local ordinance says no building can be taller than the 630ft-tall stainless steel landmark'

‹ Slide me › LA FONDA HOTEL SANTA FE: Sonderman describes Santa Fe as 'the most historic city on the original Route 66'. The photograph on the left depicts the city's La Fonda hotel back in 1930. According to the author there has been an inn - or a 'Fonda' in Spanish - on this corner since as early as 1607 but the current Pueblo Revival building was constructed in 1922. At one point The Fred Harvey Company made the hotel the headquarters for its 'Indian Detours' which opened the Southwest to tourism. Over the years the hotel has been frequented by celebrities including John F Kennedy and Ronald Reagan and several guests claim to have witnessed ghosts during their stay. The book adds: 'The completely renovated luxury hotel is now known as La Fonda on the Plaza and family ownership is committed to carrying on the 400-year tradition of hospitality'

‹ Slide me › WIGWAM MOTEL HOLBROOK ARIZONA ONE OF THREE SURVIVING WIGAM MOTELS: The image on the left was snapped in 1950 and shows the Wigwam Village Motel in Holbrook in the year it was opened by one Chester Lewis. At the time it was the sixth wigwam motel in America (the country's grand total peaked at seven). The 'iconic' tipi design was the work of Frank Redford the book explains who built them out of concrete. Redford gave Lewis the rights to the design 'in exchange for the proceeds from the pay radios located in each of the 15 units' we're told. The Wigwam Village Motel closed in 1974 and Lewis sold the business the book says. He died in 1986 and his children reopened the motel in 1988. 'Part of the former office now showcases Route 66 Civil War and Native American artefacts collected by Chester' the book explains. Today it's one of three surviving Wigwam Motels in the US - the other two can be found in Rialto California and Cave City Kentucky

‹ Slide me › COOL SPRINGS ARIZONA: Cool Springs Camp seen on the left in 1940 was opened in 1926 by N R Dunton who connected the building to a spring using a pipe the book reveals. The then-gas station which sits under 'Squaw's Teat' mountain was taken over in 1936 by a married couple who added the rock exterior. It was later bypassed by the new Route 66 roadway and became a poultry ranch only to be left abandoned completely in the 60s. It burned down in 1966. Sonderman says: 'Hollywood came calling in 1991 and producers constructed a gas station from the ruins just to blow it all up for a scene in the movie Universal Soldier.' Ned Leuchtner bought what remained of the premises in 2002 and has since turned it into a 'nifty gift shop and a mini museum' he adds

‹ Slide me › HORSESHOE CURVE GOLD ROAD ARIZONA: Look to the left and you'll see a postcard dating back to 1928 showing the horseshoe curve near the old mining town of Gold Road. 'It was a white-knuckle drive for drivers who came from back East' declares Sonderman of the roadway. Motorists travelling along Old Route 66 would ascend the 3550ft (1082m) high Sitgreaves Pass and drive down through Gold Road - until it was bypassed in 1952. The author states: 'The twisting and turning road was so challenging that service stations would charge a hefty fee to tow timid drivers over the pass. In the days of gravity-fed carburettors it wasn't unusual to meet a local driving up the hill backwards'

‹ Slide me › PIER SANTA MONICA: The snapshot on the left shows the pier in 1941. It opened in 1909 having been built to bring sewage out to the sea. 'Route 66 ends over the Pacific Ocean on Santa Monica Pier and the last few yards have to be made on foot' says Sonderman. He reveals that 'the bureaucrats decreed that US highways must end at another US route so 66 officially ends at Alternate US 101' - a 'nondescript intersection'. However Santa Monica Pier is the symbolic end of the route he adds. On Route 66's 83rd birthday Dan Rice installed an 'End of the Trail' sign on the pier outside his 66-to-Cali store - 'a more appropriate spot to contemplate the journey'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc3dpbXN3YW0uY29tL2ZpbmEtc2V0cy1kYXRlcy1mb3ItMjAyMi13b3JsZC1qdW5pb3ItY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FINA Sets Dates for 2022 World Junior Championships,"FINA has announced that the 2022 World Junior Swimming Championships will take place in Kazan Russia from August 23-28 2022.

Originally the competition was scheduled to occur August 24-29 2021 but the competition was postponed to 2022 due to the pandemic.

The postponement of the 2020 Olympic Games to 2021 led to the initially scheduled 2021 FINA World Championships moving to 2022. Subsequently World Junior Championships and the 2021 World University Games were also postponed until 2022.

In August 2021 USA Swimming announced that they would hold an International Championship Trials in April 2022 which will serve as the selection meet for the upcoming international competitions. While the selection meet is typically Summer Nationals which typically takes place in June or July World Championships is scheduled to begin on May 13.

Phillips 66 International Championship Trials will take place April 26-30 2022 in Greensboro N.C. at the Greensboro Aquatic Center.

World Junior Championships occur every two years and feature the top age group swimmers in the world. To be eligible female swimmers must be 14-17 years old and male swimmers must be 15-18 years old based on their age at the end of the year.

FINA has not provided information about their plans for age eligibility after multiple requests. British Swimming however has posted their internal selection criteria which indicates the age eligibility was not extended. To be eligible to compete at the World Junior Championships females must be born between/during years 2005 and 2008 and males must be born between/during years 2004 and 2007.

That is as compared to other postponed events including the World University Games which have extended age eligibility based on the original dates.

At the 2019 World Junior Championships held in Budapest the United States led the medal count with 37 total medals including 18 golds. The United States’ roster included future Tokyo 2020 Olympic silver medalists Torri Huske and Claire Curzan who won six and four medals in Budapest respectively.

The meet also included double Olympic medalist Thomas Ceccon of Italy who won the 100 backstroke at the 2019 World Juniors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9qb3VybmFsc3Rhci9uYW1lL2pvaG4tcXVhY2tlbmJ1c2gtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzIyNTkzMzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Quackenbush Obituary (1968 - 2022) - Lincoln NE - Lincoln Journal Star,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/journalstar/name/john-quackenbush-obituary?id=32259330 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9qb3VybmFsc3Rhci9uYW1lL2pvaG4tcXVhY2tlbmJ1c2gtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzIyNTkzMzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

It follows the successful transformation of the South East Tower which was refurbished in 2016 and garnered a crop of rave reviews.

There the accommodation is already fully booked for summer 2022 - and conservationists say the scheduled monument is ripe for the same success.

Bernard Williamson chairman of the Great Yarmouth Preservation Trust which is behind the transformation said it was one of a number of quirky holiday lets - including ""champing"" in St John's Church - that were coming to fruition.

In time the trust might also look at converting Pinnacle Tower behind Poundstretcher in the town.

The year is off to a flying start! We are very excited that @GreatYarmouthPT's next project will soon be underway and look forward to seeing the results.



Take a look at their plans👇 https://t.co/8X9XiPN7Q2 — The Architectural Heritage Fund (England) (@ArchHFundEng) January 10 2022

Funding from the Architectural Heritage Fund among others meant work could soon start at North West Tower its old lookout role making it a good vantage point for watching the river with the White Swan restaurant next door providing another draw.

Under the plans reckoned to cost at least £100000 the conversion will start on the upper floor the ground floor having no usable space.

It will likely sleep four and have its own parking area and garden.

Although not over as many levels as the South East Tower it was wider he said and in better condition.

It is hoped the tower could welcome guests this summer although problems with materials caused by the pandemic could set things back.

Mr Williamson said the trust was trying to build up a portfolio of unusual lets that would give a new lease of life to buildings securing their futures and preserving the past.

Ownership has been transferred from Great Yarmouth Borough Council to the trust.

""It is a really good option and will create a unique holiday space"" he added.

Building of the wall the best preserved in the country with 75pc still intact started in 1281 and continued for 100 years interrupted by an outbreak of plague in 1349 which wiped out about two-thirds of the townspeople.

The tower was used by the Broads Authority until 2003 and briefly by a firm of surveyors after that.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hochul,"Gov. Kathy Hochul looked like she had the state’s fat-cat ­donor club so in her pocket that she could easily glide above a couple of Democratic primary opponents — and whomever the GOP throws at her in the 2022 governor’s race.

Then came Alvin Bragg.

I hear that several Big Business community fund­raisers who have either given to Hochul or planned to do so are now looking to play hardball because she’s gone silent on the new Manhattan DA and his loopy get-out-of-jail card for criminals.

Bragg has become the poster child for “progressive” reforms thanks to a leaked policy mandate that outlined his heinous plans to allow most criminals to go free. And as I was first to report last week the New York business community is going nuts. The city needs business and tourism in Manhattan to flourish or it’s doomed.

Continued high crime is the quickest way to kill the city’s economy (remember pre-Giuliani NYC?). So big biz bombarded their normally reticent lobbying group the Partnership for New York City — and its normally restrained CEO Kathryn Wylde — with some blistering calls for action.

‘Misunderstood’?

After feeling like a piñata Wylde turned to Bragg and asked for a meeting. He politely obliged and told Wylde his policies were being “misunderstood” without specifying what part of the memo that he wrote was taken out of context.

If it’s hard to digest the absurdity of all of that you’re not alone. Members of the partnership — which includes some of the biggest most powerful players in corporate America since nearly all the big banks and real estate outfits are located here — aren’t waiting for their Jan. 21 scheduled meeting with Bragg to take action.

3 Gov. Kathy Hochul looked like she would win over businesses but the lack of response to Alvin Bragg’s reforms has some weary. AP Photo/Hans Pennink Pool

In fact as I’ve heard from several NYC business leaders they’ve heard enough from Bragg already and want either him out or his policies banished to some Ivy League college safe space.

They believe Hochul as governor is best equipped to do that. There are no recall elections in New York state. Elected officials can be removed for “any misconduct mal­administration malfeasance or malversation in office” after an application is submitted by “any citizen resident of such town village improvement … to the Appellate Division of the [state] Supreme Court.”

There is some talk from city business leaders to do just that but even they would concede it’s a long shot. That leaves it up to Hochul.

She could pressure Bragg from the bully pulpit and state unequivocally that his policies would endanger every man woman and child who walks the streets of Manhattan.

And while she does that Hochul could appoint a special prosecutor to bring cases that Bragg refuses to one prominent business leader told me.

Again not a word from the governor on any of this which has the donor set pretty peeved. My business-community sources say Hochul at least for now doesn’t want to upset the lefties as she’s still dealing with some election-primary challenges.

That doesn’t mean the business community is powerless to force Hochul do something about Bragg. A few told me they will soon make clear to her that New Yorkers are not as lefty as the state’s party leaders AOC or Bragg. It’s why Eric Adams who embraced the business community and vowed to crack down on crime was elected mayor.

3 Some of the NY business community is not pleased with Bragg’s policies. AP

They also tell me Hochul may have to choose between their campaign contributions or tacit support of Bragg’s idiocy if she doesn’t wise up.

Hochul’s didn’t return a telephone call or e-mail seeking comment.

A CEO in waiting

When Wall Street veteran Gregory Fleming went to the fledgling Rockefeller Capital Management as its CEO in 2017 the financial chattering class was shocked: This guy is Big Bank CEO material. He put together some of the biggest financial deals in recent history and saved Merrill Lynch during the financial crisis by selling it to Bank of America. He even arranged Derek Jeter’s purchase of the Miami Marlins. He could do better than that.

Since joining Rockefeller Fleming is doing pretty well in growing assets and setting the stage to it sell it to a major bank — while setting himself up to get that bank CEO job he has long cherished investment banking sources tell The Post.

All big firms want what Rockefeller does: Wealth management. Dispensing financial advice to rich people is a stable source of revenue.

3 Fleming took over as Rockefeller Capital Management CEO in 2017. WireImage

Fleming brokers have now accumulated close to $100 billion in assets from almost nil when he started. The clients are rich so the firm would be a great fit I am told for Goldman Sachs if 60-year-old CEO David Solomon wanted to share some power and appoint a successor. JPM’s Jamie Dimon might be a buyer and at 65 he could flick Fleming in as his No. 2 with a promise to run the show when he leaves.

Other names include PNC Financial Services and BlackRock the world’s largest money-management firm since its CEO Larry Fink 69 and Fleming 58 are close friends.

One thing appears to be certain: Fleming’s last job won’t be running Rockefeller. Fleming had no comment.",,,,,,,,,

Fort Myers - Fred S. Lange 101 of Fort Myers Florida passed away on Sunday January 9 2022 at the Lodge at Cypress Cove. He was born on August 4 1920 to the late Frederick Lange and Thelma Louise Stacey in Dayton Ohio. He was an enterprising young man having paper routes for both Dayton papers. He built his customer base to over 300 which necessitated his developing an accounting system for billing and building a hitch and wagon assembly to attach to his bicycle. Among those on his paper route was Orville Wright who he remembered as a wonderful storyteller.

Not surprisingly Fred graduated from the University of Dayton with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration May 20 1942 and soon began working for General Motors in the propeller plant as a cost accountant. Soon after he married Ruby literally ""the girl next door.""

During college Fred was active in ROTC and had aspirations of being a pilot so during his junior year he applied. While he was rejected because he was too tall it did not diminish his desire to serve. He enlisted August 1 1942 and served in the European Theater in ordnance and intelligence from December 1943 through September of 1945. In January he received his honorable discharge. In Fred's own words ""I helped the heroes; I am not one."" Fred's own story of his years in the service is in the Library of Congress as part of The Veterans' Heritage Project.

Over the course of his life Fred built a 35 year career with PPG Industries in their automotive paint division and with Ruby raised three children. Eventually the family settled in Detroit Michigan where Fred an avid golfer joined the Detroit Country Club. His final assignment with PPG was as Director European Operations Automotive Refinish.

Upon retirement they moved to Fort Myers settling in the golf community The Forest. Not one to be idle he served on the board and continued his passion for golf. At eighty he shot his first hole-in-one. He and Ruby discovered a love of cruising and took numerous Caribbean cruises.

Fred is survived by two of his children Marc Frederick (Vicki) Lange of Prescott Arizona Christine Stacy (Brian) Sarver of Beverly Hills Michigan six grandchildren; Errol (Emilie) Lange Marisa (Matt) Elich Michelle Lange McKenzie Sarver Ian Sarver Laura (Joseph) Colletti and five great grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife Ruby his son Gregory Neil Lange his mother father stepmother and brother.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

That’s why I took some comfort just after the attack on the Capitol when many big corporations solemnly pledged they’d no longer finance the campaigns of the 147 lawmakers who voted to overturn election results.

Well those days are over. Turns out they were over the moment the public stopped paying attention.

A report published last week by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington shows that over the past year 717 companies and industry groups have donated more than $18m to 143 of those seditious lawmakers. Businesses that pledged to stop or pause their donations have given nearly $2.4m directly to their campaigns or political action committees (Pacs).

But there’s a deeper issue here. The whole question of whether corporations do or don’t bankroll the seditionist caucus is a distraction from a much larger problem.

The tsunami of money now flowing from corporations into the swamp of American politics is larger than ever. And this money – bankrolling almost all politicians and financing attacks on their opponents – is undermining American democracy as much as did the 147 seditionist members of Congress. Maybe more.

The Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema – whose vocal opposition to any change in the filibuster is on the verge of dooming voting rights – received almost $2m in campaign donations in 2021 even though she is not up for re-election until 2024. Most of it came from corporate donors outside Arizona some of which have a history of donating largely to Republicans.

Has the money influenced Sinema? You decide. Besides sandbagging voting rights she voted down the $15 minimum wage increase opposed tax increases on corporations and the wealthy and stalled on drug price reform – policies supported by a majority of Democratic senators as well as a majority of Arizonans.

Over the last four decades corporate Pac spending on congressional elections has more than quadrupled even adjusting for inflation.

Labor unions no longer provide a counterweight. Forty years ago union Pacs contributed about as much as corporate Pacs. Now corporations are outspending labor by more than three to one.

According to a landmark study published in 2014 by the Princeton professor Martin Gilens and Northwestern professor Benjamin Page the preferences of the typical American have no influence at all on legislation emerging from Congress.

Gilens and Page analyzed 1799 policy issues in detail determining the relative influence of economic elites business groups mass-based interest groups and average citizens. Their conclusion: “The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule near-zero statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.” Lawmakers mainly listen to the policy demands of big business and wealthy individuals – those with the most lobbying prowess and deepest pockets to bankroll campaigns and promote their views.

It’s probably far worse now. Gilens and Page’s data came from the period 1981 to 2002: before the supreme court opened the floodgates to big money in the Citizens United case before Super Pacs before “dark money” and before the Wall Street bailout.

The corporate return on this mountain of money has been significant. Over the last 40 years corporate tax rates have plunged. Regulatory protections for consumers workers and the environment have been defanged. Antitrust has become so ineffectual that many big corporations face little or no competition.

Corporations have fought off safety nets and public investments that are common in other advanced nations (most recently Build Back Better). They’ve attacked labor laws reducing the portion of private-sector workers belonging to a union from a third 40 years ago to just over 6% now.

They’ve collected hundreds of billions in federal subsidies bailouts loan guarantees and sole-source contracts. Corporate welfare for big pharma big oil big tech big ag the largest military contractors and biggest banks now dwarfs the amount of welfare for people.

The profits of big corporations just reached a 70-year high even during a pandemic. The ratio of CEO pay in large companies to average workers has ballooned from 20-to-1 in the 1960s to 320-to-1 now.

Meanwhile most Americans are going nowhere. The typical worker’s wage is only a bit higher today than it was 40 years ago when adjusted for inflation.

But the biggest casualty is public trust in democracy.

In 1964 just 29% of voters believed government was “run by a few big interests looking out for themselves”. By 2013 79% of Americans believed it.

Corporate donations to seditious lawmakers are nothing compared with this 40-year record of corporate sedition.

A large portion of the American public has become so frustrated and cynical about democracy they are willing to believe blatant lies of a self-described strongman and willing to support a political party that no longer believes in democracy.

As I said at the outset capitalism is compatible with democracy only if democracy is in the driver’s seat. But the absence of democracy doesn’t strengthen capitalism. It fuels despotism.

Despotism is bad for capitalism. Despots don’t respect property rights. They don’t honor the rule of law. They are arbitrary and unpredictable. All of this harms the owners of capital. Despotism also invites civil strife and conflict which destabilize a society and an economy.

My message to every CEO in America: you need democracy but you’re actively undermining it.

It’s time for you to join the pro-democracy movement. Get solidly behind voting rights. Actively lobby for the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.

Use your lopsidedly large power in American democracy to protect American democracy – and do it soon. Otherwise we may lose what’s left of it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYnJpbmdtZXRoZW5ld3MuY29tL21pbm5lc290YS1uZXdzL2NvdmlkLXRlc3Rpbmctc2l0ZS1pbi1taW5uZWFwb2xpcy10by1tb3ZlLXRlbXBvcmFyaWx5LWFzLWJvYXQtc2hvdy1tb3Zlcy1pbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID testing site in Minneapolis to move temporarily as Boat Show moves in,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/covid-testing-site-in-minneapolis-to-move-temporarily-as-boat-show-moves-in on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYnJpbmdtZXRoZW5ld3MuY29tL21pbm5lc290YS1uZXdzL2NvdmlkLXRlc3Rpbmctc2l0ZS1pbi1taW5uZWFwb2xpcy10by1tb3ZlLXRlbXBvcmFyaWx5LWFzLWJvYXQtc2hvdy1tb3Zlcy1pbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUub3JnL2xhdGVzdC90ZXNsYS1oaXN0b3J5LXNpbGVuY2luZy13aGlzdGxlYmxvd2Vycy1jb3Jkcy0yMjAxMTUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla's Long History of Silencing Whistleblowers - Progressive.org,"On December 30 the day after Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold off $1 billion worth of his company’s stock Tesla announced a recall of nearly half a million of its electric vehicles for safety reasons. When asked if this massive recall surprised her former Tesla employee automotive engineer and whistleblower Cristina Balan responded “There will be many other recalls like this one. Tesla has hidden many safety issues to protect their stock price.”

Balan worked at Tesla from 2010 through 2014. She was well-regarded at the company and had been so instrumental in the design of the battery pack for Tesla’s early “Model S” sedan that as a tribute Tesla management incorporated her initials into the battery pack clamshell she designed.

After her work with the battery pack Balan was moved to the interiors design team. It was then that Balan began to notice and document things that she thought would compromise the company’s products: contracts being awarded on the basis of personal relationships safety issues with interior floor mats and a history of such problems being covered up by managers.

She was frustrated and seemed to find an outlet when Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent out a company-wide email that would later be hailed in the business press as an example of the “art of masterful communication.” In that email Musk laid out his vision of what good communication should look like within Tesla. His email included this exhortation:

“Anyone at Tesla can and should email/talk to anyone else according to what they think is the fastest way to solve a problem for the benefit of the whole company. You can talk to your manager’s manager without his permission you can talk directly to a VP in another dept you can talk to me. . . . Moreover you should consider yourself obligated to do so until the right thing happens.”

Balan took Musk at his word. On April 12 2014 she sent him an email asking if they could speak directly about the issues that were worrying her.

A few days later Balan was escorted to a small room at her Tesla workplace in Fremont California and asked by human resources personnel to resign. Balan agreed but only because she claims they threatened that if she decided to stay on the company would deport other members of her team. This threat against her team members resonated with Balan who is from Romania.

Despite resigning Balan refused to believe that Musk knew what had happened.

Despite resigning Balan refused to believe that Musk knew what had happened. On April 19 she sent another email directly to Musk imploring him to notice her forced resignation writing “I am afraid to get into details because I don’t trust who will get this email first! But they [sic] are quite a few people that we would like to talk to you and tell you what they’ve been thru . . . .”

Failing to hear back from Musk Balan and Tesla entered mediation to resolve various issues related to her prior employment at the company. But when mediation failed she filed an arbitration claim in April 2015. Because she had signed an arbitration agreement—an agreement in which parties agree to resolve any conflicts by pleading their respective cases before an impartial arbitrator—she was not allowed to file a suit for wrongful termination or discrimination in a regular court or to take her case before a judge or jury.

Balan’s story was eventually told in a 2017 article in the Huffington Post. After publication Tesla demanded that the news website publish the company’s 600-word response. In the post Tesla contended that Balan had chosen to resign and also that she had worked on personal projects during company time and used company money to travel without permission. (As of 2022 Tesla has never offered any evidence that either of those charges are true.)

Balan seeing the article as an accusation of embezzlement filed a defamation suit against Tesla in a federal court in Washington State where she had lived since 2014. Tesla’s attorneys countered that Balan could not file a defamation suit in federal court because she was still bound to arbitration by her original employment contract.

In June 2019 U.S. Circuit Court judge Marsha J. Pechman ruled that while some aspects of Balan’s case should remain in arbitration (and therefore not in public record) other aspects including her contention of defamation could be heard in federal court and made public.

It is not surprising that Balan through her experience with Tesla became an advocate against forced arbitration. Now nearly eight years after leaving the company Balan is driven to keep fighting. One of the things that bothers her most is Tesla’s—and in particular CEO Musk’s—clear intent to crush all critics and to keep information from the public.

Balan tells The Progressive that when the arbitration process first started she cared less about any monetary amount than about being allowed access to the email she first sent to Musk. “What’s really critical is that after I start the arbitration with them the main thing I want to know is if he actually received the email” she says. “It was the only thing that I wanted . . . and they didn’t want to produce it.”

It took more than sixteen months for Balan to be given what she calls the “raw email” that she first sent to Musk. When she finally received it she was able to see in the email’s metadata that it was opened by Musk and was forwarded to Tesla’s human resources director seven minutes after it was opened. Upon learning this Balan asked in her first arbitration for a copy of the email Musk forwarded including any additional message from him that might be on it.

Balan says she never received that second email even though the arbitrator ruled in a sua sponte decision that she be allowed to see it. That decision was made by the arbitrator when Balan was not present and Balan maintains that the attorney she had employed during that arbitration did not relay that decision or the email’s contents to her for ten months.

Balan is not the only whistleblower who has seen how hard it can be to go up against Tesla and Elon Musk.

Steven Henkes who worked as a field quality manager for SolarCity (a subsidiary that Tesla first acquired in 2016) has been trying since 2019 to inform the public about defects in the company’s solar panels that can cause fires. In a complaint he filed in 2019 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC Henkes urged Tesla management to “shut down the fire-prone solar systems report to safety regulators and notify consumers” as Reuters phrased it.

Later that year Walmart filed a lawsuit against Tesla that was later dropped charging that the company’s solar power system led to fires at seven stores. In March 2021 it was revealed that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was also proceeding with an investigation of the company’s solar panels and was interviewing Henkes. In a CNBC report Henkes relayed a message through his attorney: “There continues to be a real threat of fires due to serial defects in the Tesla installations.”

Henkes was fired from Tesla in 2020 and filed his own lawsuit against the company for wrongful termination. In 2021 he filed a Freedom of Information Act request simply to learn the status of his original complaint. In response the SEC confirmed in a September letter that “the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing.”

Both Balan and Henkes must now continue to wait and pursue their separate cases through the courts. Balan is set to file an appeal of the latest decision in her case. If she wins that she will win the right to argue her case in open court where she hopes that her evidence of corporate wrongdoing going back nearly a decade will become a part of the public record. Henkes’s case against Tesla for wrongful termination is still pending.

And the cases just keep coming. In December 2021 six current and former employees at Tesla’s San Francisco Bay Area electric auto factory and a service center in Southern California filed a lawsuit charging that they were sexually harassed at work and that the company knew about the harassment but failed to take any action to address it. One month earlier Jessica Barraza a Tesla employee in Fremont filed a lawsuit that accused the company of “rampant sexual harassment.”

Amid all this litigation Musk divested himself of roughly $1 billion worth of company stock on December 29 2021 the day before the huge Tesla recall was announced. This followed Musk’s stock sale in November of enough shares to net him nearly $5 billion.

Musk urged his horde of Twitter followers to “Blow the whistle on Tesla!” by buying a sterling silver whistle.

And stock is not all he’s been selling. Last November Musk urged his horde of Twitter followers to “Blow the whistle on Tesla!” by buying a sterling silver whistle (in the shape of the as-yet unreleased Tesla Cybertruck) for a mere $50.

The whistles sold out almost immediately.

Whistleblower advocates were not amused. As FBI whistleblower and Whistleblower Network News journalist Jane Turner tweeted “We may not have sixty-five million followers but we possess the truth.”

Musk could be forgiven for thinking he has the right to taunt whistleblowers on Twitter. On December 13 he was named as Time magazine’s “Person of the Year.” In bestowing this recognition the magazine’s writers described Musk as a “clown genius edgelord visionary industrialist showman cad; a madcap hybrid of Thomas Edison P.T. Barnum Andrew Carnegie and Watchmen’s Doctor Manhattan.”

Balan asked about fighting this battle in the year 2022 says she “never imagined that Musk will ignore [the issue she raised in her email]. You know how many stories how many whistleblowers they went to the press and they went public. I never thought to go public because I didn’t want to hurt Tesla.”

Balan believed in Tesla. The company and Elon Musk—“visionary” though he may be—might have better served their customers by believing her.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3Nwb25zb3JlZC9sYWxhLWludXRpLWFoYXJp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lala Inuti Ahari Talks About the Success of The Conjure,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.laprogressive.com/sponsored/lala-inuti-ahari on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3Nwb25zb3JlZC9sYWxhLWludXRpLWFoYXJp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vanctd2VibWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2Jlc3QtamFwYW5lc2UtZXllZ2xhc3Nlcy1zaG9wcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Best Japanese Eyeglasses Shops,"When traveling to Japan buying eyeglasses is most probably not the first thing in foreign visitors’ minds.

Attorney Sima Patel representing Gregory Wells for the estate of the late Michael Wells and attorney Paul Hudson attorney for State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. argued Thursday whether the state Supreme Court should accept Wells’ application to appeal prior rulings. They argued the case remotely and shown by video in front of the high court.

The May 2015 crash at the Washington Township park killed three and injured two boys.

The plaintiff in a separate lawsuit gained a $475000 consent judgment from Gregory Bobchick Sr. and Dawn Bobchick related to the couple furnishing alcohol to minors at their Shelby Township home prior to the crash. Each of the five occupants had a blood-alcohol level of between .024% and .086% police said.

The plaintiff says State Farm should pay the judgment because the incident was an accident.

“We’re trying to get them (State Farm) to provide coverage under the Bobchicks’ insurance policy” Patel said following the arguments.

She contends the case was prematurely dismissed by Macomb Circuit Court Judge Edward Edward Servitto whose ruling was upheld by the state Court of Appeals on request by State Farm.

During arguments Patel argued the Bobchicks could not foresee their conduct resulting in a crash. She said there is a “disconnect” between supplying the alcohol to the minors and the crash.

“The consequences that occurred were of a different type and kind that were intended” she said. “It falls outside the scope of intentional conduct.

“The direct result of providing alcohol to minors is inebriated minors. And that could have certain consequences. You could have minors who got alcohol poisoning or some other physical ailment because of becoming drunk. But then the fact that the minors picked up keys went on a joy ride and got into a crash is two sets removed from the intentional actions of the insured.”

Hudson however argued for State Farm that even if it was an accident the homeowners insurance policy doesn’t cover it calling the motor-vehicle exclusion “very simple straight-forward.”

“Homeowners policies don’t cover auto accidents; that’s what auto policies are for” Hudson said.

Justice Brian Zahra noted Servitto did not rule on the auto-exclusion issue and questioned whether State Farm could “preserve” that issue and argue it.

Hudson said State Farm raised the issue at the trial court level so is preserved for argument.

Still Hudson argued against Patel’s claim of an accident “even though the homeowner didn’t obviously intend to cause a car accident.”

“Giving alcohol to minors is not an accident within the meaning of a homeowners policy” he said. “The homeowner here undisputedly knowingly furnished alcohol to minors in their home and that intentional act included a direct risk of harm that the homeowner should have reasonably expected the consequences that they (the minors) would drive drunk and get in an accident.”

In addition to Wells 17 of Macomb Township Jonathan Manolios 17 of Sterling Heights; Emanuel ‘Manny’ Malaj 17 of Sterling Heights died in the May 8 2015 crash. Gregory Bobchick Jr. now 24 and Joseph Narra also 24 were injured. Bobchick Jr. and Narra pleaded guilty to to a charge of minor in possession a misdemeanor.

Sheriff’s investigators determined the black Jaguar S-Type was traveling 62-72 mph in a 35 mph zone on the wrong side of Park Road when it crashed into a guard rail rolled over five times and plunged into Stony Creek southwest of Stony Creek Lake’s South Dam.

Only Bobchick who was wearing a seatbelt was not ejected.

A 12-pack of Corona beer a pint of Crown Royal whiskey and a pint of rum were found in the Jaguar.

Manolios’ father George representing himself and his son’s estate in 2019 gained a $6 million judgment against the Bobchicks but whether it has been paid is unclear. Monolios’ attorney Vincent Lorelli said he could not comment.

The Manolios lawsuit also reached settlements with Narra and an insurance company but amounts were not announced court records say.

Both of Manolios’ parents George and Susan also sued the county Sheriff’s Office for naming their son as the driver. Manolios’ attorney said Prudential Life Insurance which initially balked at paying a claim to the estate ultimately paid the family after determining Manolios was not the driver U.S. District Linda Parker says in her ruling dismissing the case.

Patel also argued the high court should remand the case back to circuit court because many facts around the case have not been determined such as who owned and who was driving the Jaguar.

“The motor vehicle exclusion applies to those vehicles that are owned and driven in the household I believe” Patel said. “If you look at the pleadings themselves that hasn’t been fleshed out. So I think a remand is necessary because there is a question of fact.”

The consent judgment doesn’t make factual determinations on those matters.

“Those are still factual issues that have to be fleshed out in discovery in this case” she said.

Justice Megan Cavanagh’s remarks to Hudson seemed to back Patel’s argument.

“We don’t know the facts underlying the knowingly provided (alcohol) and whether the accident is a direct consequence of it” Cavnagh said. “Maybe they (the Bobchicks) locked up all the keys they bolted the door put the alarms on. These kids weren’t going to leave. They knowingly provided alcohol but it’s not necessarily a conclusion that an accident would’ve been a direct result of their conduct. What if there was no way they could get a car?”

Chief Justice Bridget McCormack said information about Gregory Bobchick Jr. being in the car “feels relevant” to this case.

“The funky fact here is that there’s yet another intentional and illegal act by another insured in between serving the alcohol and the car crash” she said.

But Hudson countered: “The only fact we need frankly is did they knowingly furnish alcohol to minors because that in itself creates a direct risk of harm. Then they have to reasonably expect all of the consequences so we don’t need further development of facts here.”

He said the Bobchicks collected $100000 from their auto policy because they owned the vehicle and “They considered it the son’s car.”

“There’s no relevant dispute of fact here” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFua2luZy1hbmQtZmluYW5jZS9iYW5rcy1pbnZlc3RtZW50LXBvcnRmb2xpby1yYmktcGl0Y2hlcy1uZXctY2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24tdmFsdWF0aW9uLW5vcm1zLTc3MjM4Njkv0gGWAWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9idXNpbmVzcy9iYW5raW5nLWFuZC1maW5hbmNlL2JhbmtzLWludmVzdG1lbnQtcG9ydGZvbGlvLXJiaS1waXRjaGVzLW5ldy1jbGFzc2lmaWNhdGlvbi12YWx1YXRpb24tbm9ybXMtNzcyMzg2OS9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banks’ investment portfolio: RBI pitches for new classification valuation norms,"Aiming to align the investment portfolio of banks with the global prudential framework and accounting standards the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday proposed new norms for their classification and valuation.

According to a discussion paper by the central bank ‘Review of Prudential Norms for Classification Valuation and Operations of Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks’ the new bank portfolio classification norms will come into effect from April 1 2023. It has invited comments on the paper from stakeholders by February 15.

As per the proposed norms the investment portfolio of banks will be divided into three categories — held-to-maturity (HTM) available for sale (AFS) and fair value through profit and loss account (FVTPL). Within FVTPL held-for-trading (HFT) shall be a sub-category aligned with the specifications of ‘Trading Book’ as per the Basel-III framework.

The new norms propose to bridge the gap between the existing guidelines and global standards and practices with regards to classification valuation and operations of the investment portfolio of commercial banks.

The extant instructions pertaining to the prudential norms on the classification and valuation of the investment portfolio are largely based on the Report of Informal Group on Valuation of Banks’ Investment Portfolio which was submitted in 1999.

The recommendations of this informal group culminated in the issue of prudential guidelines on the investment portfolio in October 2002 which forms the basis of the current norms.

While the RBI has been tweaking the guidelines in response to situations as they emerge a comprehensive review has not been undertaken so far resulting in a wide gap between the country’s norms and the global standards and practices the regulator said.

It is against this backdrop that a discussion paper reviews the rationale and the evolution of the current framework the corresponding global standards and developments in the financial markets before framing its proposals. WITH PTI",,,,,,,,,

WinFuture has obtained what it says are leaked official images and specs for the Ultra (pictured above) and its more modestly-sized counterparts. The Ultra would unsurprisingly revolve around its 14.6-inch 2960 x 1848 AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and S-Pen support but it would come with as much as 16GB of RAM and 512GB of expandable storage. If you don't mind the display notch built to hold dual 12MP front cameras this might be the ultimate Android tablet.

All Galaxy Tab S8 models would reportedly have Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip dual rear cameras (13MP main 6MP ultra wide) Dolby Atmos-capable quad speakers and optional 5G. The differences would mostly come down to screens memory and storage. The 12.7-inch Tab S8+ would carry a 120Hz 2800 x 1752 AMOLED panel one 12MP front camera 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of expandable storage. The 11-inch regular Tab S8 would 'just' include a 120Hz 2560 x 1600 LCD but otherwise offer features similar to the mid-tier model.

The release date and pricing weren't mentioned in the Galaxy Tab S8 leak. However WinFuture expects Samsung to introduce the range at its rumored February 8th Unpacked event.

While that looks to be a slight upgrade on the Redmi Note 10's Snapdragon 678 looks can be deceiving and here we offer a more in-depth perspective on both chipsets.

4 Reviews

Xiaomi's Redmi Note 11 series debuted for the Chinese market a few months ago. While the company has brought the phones to Western markets with Poco badges it's yet to release the Redmi Note 11 series properly outside China. Reports indicate that the Redmi Note 11 could make the trip with a Snapdragon 680 onboard so it's important to take a have a quick look at what to expect from a device that could be a fan favorite when it's released.

On paper the Snapdragon 680 looks to be a minor upgrade on the Redmi Note 10's Snapdragon 678. It has a bigger model number so it has to be better. Well not quite. Indeed the Snapdragon 680 is likely to be a considerably more efficient chipset than the Snapdragon 678 as it's built on a 6 nm node versus the latter's now-archaic 11 nm process. Things get a bit more interesting though.

While the Snapdragon 680 does seem like it has a slightly better CPU than the Snapdragon 678—it's clocked at up to 2.4 GHz versus the latter's 2.2 GHz—the rest of the hardware raises a few questions. For one the Snapdragon 680's X11 LTE modem is flat-out worse than the Snapdragon 678's X12 LTE modem. This isn't just speculation either: Qualcomm lists the Snapdragon 680 with a peak download speed of 390 Mbps. The Snapdragon 678? 600 Mbps.

In addition the Snapdragon 680 is equipped with an Adreno 610 GPU. The Snapdragon 678 gets an Adreno 612. For some perspective the Adreno 610 is the same GPU on the Snapdragon 665 and Snapdragon 662. The Snapdragon 665 was on the Redmi Note 8. The plot thickens. In fact the Snapdragon 680 uses Qualcomm's Kryo 265 cores which is closer to the Snapdragon 665's Kryo 260 cores than the Snapdragon 678's Kryo 460 cores. Lastly the Snapdragon 680 only offers support for Quick Charge 3. The Snapdragon 678 on the other hand supports Quick Charge 4+.

All available data points towards one conclusion: the Snapdragon 680 isn't the upgrade to the Snapdragon 678 Qualcomm would have you believe. Rather than being an incremental upgrade to the Snapdragon 678 the Snapdragon 680 is more of a successor to the Snapdragon 662 and Snapdragon 665.",,,,,,

Hong

Walmart has filed several new trademarks hoping to produce and sell virtual goods.

Separate filings show the retailer also plans to create its own cryptocurrency and NFTs.

The retailer joins a slew of businesses rushing to capitalize on Web3 and the metaverse.

Walmart will join Facebook Nike Ralph Lauren Bumble Disney and a string of other companies with plans to claim their own corner of the metaverse.

The retailer the largest private employer in the US quietly filed several trademark applications in late December which described extensive plans to sell virtual merchandise. CNBC was first to report on the applications.

Walmart is directing its attention to the virtual world like many others including Facebook which rebranded itself last year to Meta and publicly announced its goals to invest and expand into the metaverse a virtual space where people can interact digitally using avatars.

According to a filing Walmart lists a variety of virtual goods it plans to sell including electronics appliances apparel home goods toys and personal care products. A separate filing shows the company's interest in creating its own cryptocurrency payment method and collection of non-fungible tokens or NFTs.

According to the US Patent and Trademark Office Walmart filed seven separate applications on December 30.

""Walmart is continuously exploring how emerging technologies may shape future shopping experiences"" the company said in an email to Insider. ""We don't have anything further to share today but it's worth noting we routinely file trademark applications as part of the innovation process.""

Despite many companies' plans for the metaverse business leaders remain unsure of how to create a fully-fledged metaverse. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have said that the metaverse could be an $8 trillion opportunity but the challenge would be getting consumers to buy into it. However Walmart saw its online sales thrive in 2021 with sales at $11.1 billion in its third quarter according to a Digital Commerce 360 report which could prove useful for Walmart's metaverse ambitions.

A number of apparel-based retailers have already begun making their own metaverse experiences.

But as huge as it was to blow the Chiefs out of Raymond James Stadium in 31-9 fashion they didn’t get the full home-field advantage for the game.

With the NFL logo at midfield “Chiefs” painted in one end zone no cannon fire and the lack of the usual gameday elements it was hard to really call Super Bowl LV a “home” game for Tampa Bay. In fact the Bucs were only designated as the “home team” for the matchup because it just happened to be the NFC’s year to field the home team. Add a COVID-restricted crowd to all of that and it’s fair to say Bucs fans haven’t gotten to experience a true home playoff game in well over a decade.

That will change on Sunday afternoon as Tom Brady and the Bucs will welcome the Philadelphia Eagles to town for an NFC Wild Card Round contest. It will mark Tampa Bay’s first home game at “Ray Jay” since Jan. 6 2008 when it lost 24-14 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Giants.

As seen on the Buccaneers’ official social media accounts the “New Sombrero” (shoutout to Chris Berman) is all set to welcome the Tampa Bay faithful for what is expected to be a windy afternoon. The beloved red end zones are back as are the Bucs battle flags that became a staple at home playoff games throughout the franchise’s initial golden era.

When the Bucs and Eagles kick off at 1:00 p.m. on Sunday the flags will be waving the cannons will be firing and a packed house will be on hand to cheer on the team in pewter and white. What a scene it’ll be.

Ready Bucs Nation?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvZWFnbGVzL25ld3Mvbm90LXJlYWR5LWZvci1wcmltZXRpbWUtZWFnbGVzLXN3YW1wZWQtaW4tdGFtcGEtYmF5LTMxLTE10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Not-Ready-For-Primetime Eagles Swamped in Tampa Bay 31-15,"The upstarts from Philadelphia were no match for Tom Brady ad the defense of the defending Super Bowl champions

TAMPA – The Eagles’ return to the playoffs after a one-year absence was a dud.

They nearly laid a goose-egg losing 31-15 to the defending Super Bowl champions on Sunday on the same field the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the title on last year Raymond James Stadium.

The Bucs led 31-0 in the fourth quarter before the Eagles offense did anything so the numbers the final stats will be skewed since they came in garbage time.

The loss wasn’t unexpected. It was after all a tall task.

A competitive game however was expected if only because the Bucs were without WRs Antonio Brown and Chris Godwin and running back Leonard Fournette. Then they lost All-Pro right tackle Tristan Wirfs to an ankle injury in the first quarter.

It didn’t matter. A competitive game never materialized.

The Eagles lost this one when they won the toss and elected to defer. Instead Tom Brady took the field and led a touchdown drive that spanned 75 yards in 12 plays that took all of five minutes.

OK that wasn’t the turning point.

The Eagles weren’t winning this one even if they sent their offense onto the field first.

They trailed 14-0 after the first quarter and never found their footing looking overwhelmed by the moment though head coach Nick Sirianni didn’t see that.

“I don’t want to say the moment got too big for them” he said. “I think we just made some mistakes. Coaching it always starts with me as a coach. There were some coaching mistakes and there’s going to be guys that want some plays back out there but I didn’t sense for a moment that the moment was too big for them.

“There was a great atmosphere here but I never felt that out there. We just didn’t make some plays we didn’t coach good enough.”

The Eagles committed three turnovers two of which led to touchdowns for Tampa the other came in the end zone when Jalen Hurts couldn’t get enough on a throw to DeVonta Smith at the end of the first half and Mike Edwards intercepted him in the end zone.

“I want to say DeVonta got open on the play” said Hurts. “I was expecting that. The safety came up the hash. I couldn’t get it up as soon as I wanted to. I got it up there a little late. He made a good catch on the sideline.”

Hurts became the youngest quarterback to start a playoff game in team history and he looked every bit of his 23 years. He talked during the week about having played in big games during his days at Alabama and Oklahoma but college is college and the pros are another level altogether.

Now he knows that.

Perhaps this experience will help him going forward.

Right now it stings and it should. His biggest play was a 35-yard throw to Quez Watkins but then right after that he threw his first pick the one in the end zone that ended the chance at points before halftime.

Too many of his throws were wobbly and off-target.

Hurts finished his first playoff start with 22 completions in 40 attempts for 242 yards. Not near good enough considering many of those numbers came in the anti-climactic fourth quarter.

“We didn’t execute good enough” said Hurts. “We didn’t do our job good enough. I didn’t do my job good enough. Communicating. Doing the little things. I could’ve been better definitely. I think there are a couple different areas where we can shoulder this as a team. But I take accountability for my actions.”

In their first playoff games Smith and Jalen Reagor did mostly nothing except for Reagor who fumbled a punt at midfield after the Eagles’ defense had forced a three-and-out.

Of course the Bucs took advantage of the second turnover of the day for the Eagles going 28 yards in five plays with the capper Tom Brady finding Rob Gronkowski for a 2-yard touchdown with 7:38 to play to make it 24-0.

Hurts’ second pick led to another TD a 36-yard TD from Brady to Mike Evans and it was 31-0 with 5:18 to play in the third.

The Eagles had hoped for a different outcome from the first meeting between the teams on Oct. 14 a 28-22 loss that wasn’t that close after Tampa took a 28-7 lead in the second half.

The second time around was all-too-familiar with a ground attack that featured only one running back and that was Miles Sanders who made his return from a broken hand to run seven times for 16 times and adding another 12 yards on three catches.

As a team the Eagles ran for just 95 yards on 17 runs well below their average of 159 yards per game which led the NFL.

“Moving the front edge pressure disguising the coverages” said LT Jordan Mailata when asked what the Bucs were doing to shut down that part of the Eagles’ game. “They did a good job. I feel like they respected our run game and put together a good game plan to effectively stop us.”

Sirianni touted his stable of running backs leading up to the game but there were no touches in either the run or pass game from Jordan Howard Boston Scott until the fourth quarter. With his one carry Scott went 34 yards into the end zone to prevent a shutout.

Rookie Kenny Gainwell was used in the pass game and he was the Eagles’ other touchdown-maker scoring a 16-yard reception with 4:45 to play.

Granted the game turned quickly against the Eagles and after Tampa Bay had taken a 17-0 lead on a 34-yard field goal from Ryan Succop the Eagles at that point had one first down and had run just 10 plays to Tampa’s 15 first downs and 35 plays run so there weren’t many opportunities to open the playbook.

""We missed our goal"" said safety Rodney McLeod. ""This obviously hurts any loss. We wanted our season to continue on to the Super Bowl that’s what we play this game for. But there are a lot of positives to take away from the season.

""...It’s unfortunate we lost but there’s a lot you can hang your hat on and walk away from this game with your head held high.""

Added Mailata: ""We're a young team with a young coach this is only the beginning.""

Read more

The sound inside Chickie’s and Pete’s was like thunder hundreds of voices swelling together as “Fly Eagles Fly” trumpeted from speakers of the jam-packed South Philadelphia restaurant.

A thousand miles to the south Eagles running back Boston Scott had just scampered into the end zone at Raymond James Stadium putting the team within ... ah ... 24 points of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. There were at that moment about 12 minutes left in Sunday’s wild card playoff game.

“Oh my God!” Marie Williams yelled from a small table at Chickie’s. “We got on the scoreboard!”

It was that kind of a day for the Eagles — they were even more overmatched by the Buccaneers than the 31-15 final score suggested — and for their long-suffering fans.

“I’m disappointed. I came into today with some hope that we could pull it off” said Williams 65 of West Oak Lane. “I did not expect it to be like this.”

“You got to move on” implored her son Michael Williams 46. “We got three [first-round] draft picks!”

Nothing could have kept fans such as the Williamses from watching the game alongside other Eagles diehards — not the still-raging Covid-19 pandemic nor the threat of a winter storm or the likelihood of some playoff heartache.

That’s because the Eagles are more than a football team more than a Sunday afternoon escape. They’re a civic soap opera one that the city hasn’t been able to turn away from for nearly 90 years. A bad season like the four-win train wreck of 2020 just ensured that the 2021 season would be all the more compelling layered with intrigue and possibility.

Maybe Nick Sirianni would prove to be a capable first-time head coach and not an iffy gamble on the part of Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie.

Maybe Jalen Hurts would play well enough to convince everyone he was the answer at quarterback and not a riddle.

Maybe this team a hodgepodge of young kids and veteran holdovers from the group that won Super Bowl LII could find a spark and go on a run.

The season started ugly with Eagles losing five of their first seven games.

“But then they shifted the needle in the right direction in the second half of the season” said Joe Wertz a season ticket holder for four decades.

Wertz 66 of Ridley Township didn’t expect the Eagles to topple the Buccaneers but didn’t expect them to get pancaked either. Still he’s optimistic about the team’s future.

“We’ve lived through worse times than this” he said.

It was unsurprising but no less annoying to see the city’s dream of a long playoff run ended by Tom Brady the Buccaneers’ ageless quarterback.

In 2005 — when Hurts was just a boy of 6 — a then-20-something Brady led the New England Patriots to a 24-21 victory over the Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX. Some Eagles coaches accused the Patriots of cheating during that game but Brady went on to collect more Super Bowl trophies and NFL records with relative ease.

The Eagles got their revenge in 2018 beating Brady and the Patriots in the thrill-a-minute Super Bowl LII. (Brady infamously did not shake hands after the game with Eagles quarterback Nick Foles.)

“I hate Tom Brady” said Monty G the instantly recognizable uber-Eagles fan.

He sat quietly at a table at Chickie’s and Pete’s an expression of genuine hurt spreading across his face. An eagle sculpture its wings outstretched sat perched on the brim of his cap.

“I’m hurting. Jalen he wasn’t ready” the 52-year-old said. “I thought it would be close. I thought we had a plan.”

Monty G’s connection to the team runs a little deeper than most. In 2020 he was hospitalized for four months due to complications from COVID-19. He said former Eagles players including Brian Dawkins sent him get-well wishes.

“I prayed I’d have another week with this team” he said Sunday. “I’m trying not to cry.”

The end of this season though just means that the countdown to the next has already begun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9nYWxsZXJ5LzIwMjIvMDEvMTYvcGhvdG9zLWJ1Y3MtdnMtZWFnbGVzLWluLXdpbGQtY2FyZC1nYW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Bucs defeat the Eagles in wild-card game,"ONLY AVAILABLE FOR SUBSCRIBERS

NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Custom Graphics Cards Cost Up To $4500 US Making It The Most Expensive GeForce To Date

We had already reported how the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti would be NVIDIA's most expensive single-chip flagship when it launches. While we are bound to hear more details later this month it looks like a few European retailers have decided to list various custom models online. Videocardz was able to spot several Swiss and German retail outlets that are listing the MSI variant of the cards at various prices. These prices are preliminary but you also shouldn't expect the card to be priced at all around its MSRP which is going to be higher than the existing RTX 3090 ($1499 US). The prices are listed below:

#1 MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X: 3201 EUR / ~3654 USD

#2 MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X: 3678 CHF / ~4024 USD

#3 MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti SUPRIM X: 4111 CHF / ~4497 USD

MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti GAMING X TRIO: 3129 EUR / ~3571 USD

Now these prices aren't stable and vary a lot from retailer to retailer. The same MSI GeForce RTX 3090 SUPRIM X can be found for as low as $3654 USD and up to $4497 US. That's a difference of 23% and we also have to consider that all of these prices are with VAT included. Compared to the RTX 3090 prices from the same retailers you are looking at a 30% price bump for the 'Ti' variant.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is going to be really pricey when it launches but when it launches is the bigger question since the production of custom models has reportedly been halted due to the BIOS and hardware issues. Now these are all rumors for now and NVIDIA has stated that they will have more details to share later this month.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Graphics Card Specifications - Full Fat GA102 GPU & 24 GB GDDR6X Memory

At the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card lies the GA102 GPU. The GA102 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA102 GPU is the fastest gaming GPU that NVIDIA has produced. The GPU is based on Samsung's 8nm custom process node designed specifically for NVIDIA and features a total of 28 Billion transistors. It measures 628mm2 which makes it the 2nd biggest gaming GPU ever produced right below the Turing TU102 GPU.

2 of 9

The new shader core on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is 2.7x faster the new RT cores are 1.7x faster while the new Tensor cores are up to 2.7x faster than the previous generation Turing GPUs. The 2nd Generation RT core delivers dedicated hardware-accelerated ray-tracing performance & features twice the ray/triangles intersection with concurrent RT graphics and compute operations.

For the GeForce RTX 3090 NVIDIA has enabled a total of 84 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 10752 CUDA cores (vs 82 SM / 10496 cores on RTX 3090 Non-Ti). In addition to the CUDA cores NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores Tensor cores and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The GPU runs at a base clock speed of 1560 MHz and a boost clock speed of 1860 MHz. The card has a TDP of 450W.

In terms of memory the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti comes packed with 24 GB of memory and that too the next-generation GDDR6X design. With Micron's latest and greatest graphics memory dies the RTX 3090 Ti can deliver GDDR6X memory speeds of 21 Gbps. That along with a bus interface of 384-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 1008 Gbps.

There aren't any performance numbers that NVIDIA is sharing right now but from what has been showcased the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is faster than the RTX 3090 Non-Ti and also displaces the RX 6900 XT.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRzb2dhbWluZy5jb20vdmlkZW90cmFpbGVyLW5ld3MvaGVyZS1pcy1tb25zdGVyLWh1bnRlci1yaXNlLWluLThrLW9uLW52aWRpYS1ydHgtMzA5MC13aXRoLXJlc2hhZGUtcmF5LXRyYWNpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here is Monster Hunter Rise in 8K on NVIDIA RTX 3090 with Reshade Ray Tracing,"Capcom has just released Monster Hunter Rise on PC and Digital Dreams shared a video showcasing the game running in 8K with Reshade Ray Tracing.

In order to capture this gameplay footage Digital Dreams used an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090. The YouTuber also used an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X CPU with 32GB of RAM.

Monster Hunter Rise was initially released on Nintendo Switch. As such the game does not look as good as Monster Hunter World. Still and with Reshade Ray Tracing it can at least look better than its vanilla version.

As we’ve mentioned Marty McFly’s post-process RT solution is only using depth information available in screen space in order to provide these “path tracing” effects. As such these Ray Tracing effects are not as accurate as the native RT effects that some games support. Nevertheless this RT workaround can further enhance a game’s Global Illumination and Ambient Occlusion effects.

Speaking of 8K videos here are Just Cause 3 GTA 5 and Crysis 3 running in 8K. You can also find Assassin’s Creed Valhalla Assassin’s Creed Origins and Skyrim in 8K. Oh and we have also shared 8K videos for Red Dead Redemption 2 Batman Arkham Knight Battlefield 1 & Metal Gear Solid 5 as well as Diablo 3 Battlefield Bad Company 2 COD: Modern Warfare RIDE 4 Halo Remaster Forza Horizon 5 The Witcher 3 Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Horizon Zero Dawn.

At the official launch of the Nvidia reference GeForce RTX 3090 Ti earlier in the month Nvidia avoided sharing any pricing or availability dates. Still the pair of MSI custom designs we have gone up for sale in Switzerland for the equivalent of $4000 or thereabouts.

Above you can see some screenshots of the retail listings from the aptly named Swiss etailer Top Preise. If you click left and right you can switch between listings for the MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Suprim X MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Gaming X Trio and their non-Ti brethren from the same outlet. These price uplifts are pretty astonishing with this reseller adding up to a 66% premium on the new halo cards from MSI and Nvidia.

The upgrade going from the GeForce RTX 3090 to RTX 3090 Ti might be nice to have but paying this much for the only modestly improved (on paper) Ti would likely be mostly for bragging rights. There is some hope that these prices could be early placeholder prices but the untidy sums suggest otherwise.

As we covered at the Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti Founders Edition launch the new GeForce champ offers a minor bump in CUDA core count using a fully-enabled GA102 GPU giving it 84 SMs (streaming multiprocessors) and 10752 CUDA cores. The 'plain old' RTX 3090 has 82 SMs and 10496 CUDA cores - not much of a downgrade in percentage terms. In addition memory bandwidth should be improved with Nvidia upgrading the 24GB GDDR6X to 21Gbps with denser ICs and halving the memory chip count for more direct cooling. At the time of writing we still don't have Nvidia confirmed core clocks for the RTX 3090 Ti nor these MSI custom cards.

As a footnote it is exciting to see this latest retailer spill given that only days ago multiple outlets said their sources had alerted them to a halt on GeForce RTX 3090 Ti production due to issues with both hardware and firmware. Before this rumor hit the fan we comfortably accepted Nvidia's guidance to get further first-hand details about the RTX 3090 Ti later this month."

These projects are expected to make it one of the largest realtors in terms of the topline.

The realty firm has built the first uber apartment tower Signature in the heart of the tony central business district of BKC last decade and is now home to some of the biggest names in India Inc such as Gautam Adani and Uday Kotak.

Suntech over the past 18 months has acquired land banks for five major residential projects in Vasai West Vasind Borivali West Shahad in Kalyan and Pen-Khopoli. These projects have a development potential of 23 million sq ft and can fetch close to Rs 20000 crore over the next seven to eight years Sunteck Realty founder-chairman and managing director Kamal Khetan told PTI in a recent interaction.

That apart it is also launching the next phases of the Sunteck World in the northwestern suburbs of Naigaon and Sunteck City at the Oshiwara district centre in Goregaon West. These projects have a revenue potential of Rs 2000 crore over the next four-five years said the first-generation entrepreneur Khetan.

He added that these projects can generate Rs 1250 crore in topline in FY23 alone while total revenue potential from the first phase of these projects will be Rs 3400 crore.

Sunteck will be launching the first phase of these projects next fiscal with the Vasai West and Shahad in Kalyan projects fetching Rs 1150 crore each Borivali West netting around Rs 900 crore and Vasind project selling for around Rs 200 crore he said adding the second phase of Sunteck City at Goregaon West has a revenue potential of Rs 750 crore and the new phase of the Sunteck World at Naigaon can generate Rs 500 crore in sales.

So all in all we are looking at launching inventory worth Rs 4650 crore by the end of FY23 Khetan said setting an incremental 30 per cent sales target for FY22 and FY23 and a pre-sales target of Rs 2000 crore by end-FY23.

Khetan does not believe that the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic will scupper the realty sector following a strong pent-up demand now as buyers who have been waiting for almost two years are active nudged by lower interest rates and stamp duty cuts and the record property registration being reported now from across the country.

Moreover many states have ruled out complete lockdowns therefore we expect the momentum to continue for the immediate future he added.

Sunteck has been one of the largest acquirers of projects/land banks in the past 18 months strengthening its presence in the MMR market and becoming one of the fastest-growing realty companies in megapolis.

Some of its recent land acquisitions include a marquee 50-acre land parcel at Shahad in Kalyan which has the potential to develop 10 million sq ft of the integrated residential township and revenue potential of Rs 9000 crore; a sea-facing 50-acre in Vasai West with a development potential of 4 million sq ft and a sales potential of around Rs 5000 crore.

A waterfront plot for luxury residences at Vasind in Borivali West has the potential to develop 2.6 million sqft and bring in around Rs 2000 crore in topline; and a river-front land parcel at the scenic Pen-Khopoli.

While the Vasai West will be mid-income units with 4.5 million sq ft of saleable area and a revenue of Rs 5000 crore the Vasind project is an affordable one offering 2.6 million sq ft of saleable space generating Rs 1250 crore in sales; the Borivali West is a luxury project with 1 million sqft saleable area generating around Rs 2000 crore the Shahad will also be affordable offering 10 million sqft fetching Rs 9000 crore of income and Pen-Khopoli will be developed as second homes offering 5 million sq ft generating Rs 2500 crore in topline.

These seven projects can sell 23 million sqft and generate around Rs 22000 crore Khetan said.

Meanwhile the company had pre-sales of Rs 352 crore in Q3 up 29 per cent sequentially and Rs 800 crore in the first three-quarters of FY22.

Jones teamed up with Cejudo at Fight Ready in Scottsdale Ariz. this past November after his longtime coach Mike Winkeljohn banned him from entering JacksonWink MMA Jones’ longtime home gym in Albuquerque N.M. Winkeljohn’s decision was in response to Jones’ domestic violence arrest for allegedly assaulting his wife; the charge was later dropped after Jones agreed to a plea deal.

The situation left Jones training only out of his home gym which he knew wasn’t good enough as he continued preparations for an eventual move up to heavyweight. So he synced up with Cejudo who’s turned to coaching since unexpectedly retiring in May 2020.

In a recent interview with MMA Junkie Radio Cejudo spoke about his approach to training Jones and why their union works.

“We think outside the box so it’s different for us. We’re not part of a team” Cejudo said. “I saw the thing you guys talked about: ‘Where should he go? ATT he should go to blah blah blah.’ No not really. What you do with a guy like Jon Jones is you build a team around him. He is the team. He doesn’t need to be pushed. He needs to be tweaked. He’s already been through hell. He’s already been through the turmoil.”

Cejudo said how he approached working with Jones (26-1 MMA 20-1 UFC) falls in line with the overall theme of Fight Ready.

“That’s kind of what we do with the athletes here” Cejudo said. “Once somebody comes here and sees what we have planned it’s just different because it’s all catered toward their ability. You know what a good coach does fundamentally? A good coach just adjusts you and holds you to your standards adjusts you fundamentally but understands your gifts. If a coach is teaching the same combination the same thing to all the other fighters then it’s all about the coach. And it shouldn’t be like that. It should be about the athletes.”

For the first time in his career Jones 34 went an entire calendar year without fighting after missing all of 2021. He hasn’t competed since a narrow win over Dominick Reyes in February 2020.

Jones has said he hopes to return to the UFC by July. And when he does he’ll be equipped with some new tricks of the trade thanks to Cejudo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ncmFiLXBhcnRuZXItc3R1ZmZlZC1hbmltYWwtdmFsZW50aW5lLTE5MTE0NTM4Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grab Your Partner a Stuffed Animal for Valentine's Day Before They Sell Out — Target Squishmallows & More!,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission.

Brent Stirton/Getty Images

Top US companies and trade groups have donated more than $8.1 million to Republican lawmakers who voted against Joe Biden's certification as president according to a report by watchdog Accountable.US.

After a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol on January 6 2021 many companies scrambled to cut ties with the 147 GOP lawmakers who voted against certifying the 2020 election result.

Dozens of companies including Walmart Amazon Morgan Stanley and AT&T said they would stop donating to these 147 Republican lawmakers – a group dubbed the Sedition Caucus by political opponents. Others including Microsoft Deloitte and Goldman Sachs said they would pause all political donations.

But Accountable.US says donations to the GOP election objectors soon recovered.

""What makes no sense is why major corporations chose to reward the politicians that weaponized Donald Trump's Big Lie with millions of dollars in campaign cash"" Kyle Herrig president of Accountable.US told Insider.

In the aftermath of the Capitol siege ""many big-name companies assured their customers and employees how much they value our democracy but it's obvious they value something more – holding political influence over as many lawmakers as possible even if those lawmakers voted to subvert our government"" Herrig said.

Here are some of the top donors to the GOP election objectors per Accountable.US's corporate donations tracker which is based on Federal Election Commission (FEC) data on direct donations from Fortune 500 companies and 700 trade associations.

Financial Services Sector - An India Economic Strategy To 2035,"Summary

India's financial services sector typifies the progress and opportunity of its economy. The sector will grow rapidly out to 2035 driven by rising incomes heightened government focus on financial inclusion and digital adoption – India's digital payments could pass $1 trillion by 2030.

As the Indian market matures Australian businesses could partner with Indian financial services companies in sectors that align with our competitive strengths in asset management general insurance and fintech.

Partnership opportunities will be niche targeting the economically advanced parts of India and in segments not dominated by state-owned enterprises.

While Australian expertise may not be transferable on a large scale to an Indian context given differences in target markets and goal orientation India's financial services sector will become more globally connected.

Success in India will require strong local knowledge and a willingness to operate on longer time horizons than Australian financial services firms are used to and for India to have made progress in regulatory clarity and investor protections.

Out to 2035 technological change will have a transformational effect on this sector. India is set to benefit and could leapfrog Australia while our industry struggles with legacy systems.

While the financial services sector and investment decisions are commercially-led government can play a role in bridging knowledge and expectations gaps.

Sharing Australia's regulatory experience and work on setting standards with Indian policy makers could also facilitate commercial engagement.

1.0 The macro story

Key judgement India's financial services sector is poised to grow on the back of rising incomes significant government attention and the increasing pace of digital adoption. The long term fundamentals of the sector are sound but the Indian Government's openness to private players and foreign participation is likely to remain patchy. Australia's competitive strengths include an efficiently regulated domestic sector high volume of funds under management and niche sector expertise which align with India's ambitions for improving its financial services sector. However differences in market drivers will limit the transferability of Australian expertise to an Indian context.

1.1 The scale and key structural drivers of the sector

Indian demand

Rising incomes will drive demand for financial services across income brackets in India including in insurance and retail banking services

the number of HNWIs is forecast to triple to over 1.2 million by 2030 96

by 2035 India's five largest cities will have economies of comparable size to middle income countries today Mumbai alone is projected to have an economy in 2030 as big as Malaysia today. 69



High competition and many local players limit opportunities in the Indian retail banking sector

State-owned banks represent 70 per cent of India's retail banking sector yet are responsible for only 43 per cent of profits 25 privatisation is unlikely but the need to improve provision of credit could see the Indian Government approve the entry of more private banks

fragmentation has forced a large number of smaller private banks to compete on price and thin profit margins

regulations in place since 1972 require at least 40 per cent of bank lending to be directed to agriculture and 'economically weaker' sectors.

India's state-owned Life Insurance Corporation holds over 75 per cent of the life insurance market while 20 other firms compete for the remaining share12

industry premiums coverage and pay-out rules are highly regulated and subject to frequent change

Indian companies have strong distribution networks and local expertise and foreign players may struggle to identify suitable segments of the market to target.

There is greater capacity for private sector and foreign entrants in general insurance which is expected to grow between 13–19 per cent annually out to 2025 especially since many Indian insurance firms lack expertise in product development.97

CASE STUDY: Future Fund: Successful investment in the future means taking a long view With its high growth economic trajectory structural reforms aimed at lifting productivity and recent loosening of foreign investment caps India offers genuine investment opportunities for Australian institutional investors. Australia's sovereign wealth fund Future Fund has found success by pursuing a long term investment horizon and moving away from using quarterly benchmarks to define performance. Rather than focusing primarily on equities Future Fund has selected investments in alternative asset classes such as infrastructure property private equity and hedge funds. This diversification gives an edge across geographies and emerging economies. The Future Fund approach requires a sophisticated understanding of risk – and it pays rewards. Future Fund has delivered returns of 7.7 per cent over its first 10 years of operation – a performance that has captured international attention and strengthened its brand. Future Fund acknowledges that investing in India comes with challenges particularly the lack of recognition of sovereign immunity for tax purposes. Further reforms to address sovereign risks that impact on the stability of cash flows will continue to grow India's attractiveness as an investment destination. In particular Future Fund is watching for success in combating corruption improving regulatory quality and the rule of law surrounding investor protection.

Demand will also rise for financial services at the lower end of the income spectrum

the Government of India has made financial inclusion a top priority by launching and expanding multiple programs creating and strengthening transparency and digital systems and enforcing regulatory measures to increase competition

government efforts to persuade cash-based vendors to embrace formal banking including through device-based and digital payments will also accelerate financial services demand from micro and SMEs

Australian firms however do not have experience or expertise in serving this market.

Indian supply

Fast digital adoption from consumers and skilled IT clusters such as those in Hyderabad and Bengaluru will continue driving the expansion of India's fintech industry which is expected to double between 2016 and 2020 to $3.2 billion142

the rate of technological change makes it difficult to forecast long term projections of the size of the fintech market in India.

The development of India's technological and entrepreneurial ecosystem will make it easier to expand the financial services market into regional and rural areas

while financial inclusion has been a focus of Indian policy makers for decades progress is now being seen

new technologies are now making it viable for example the rollout of the Aadhaar card a national biometric identification system now covering over one billion people creates a comprehensive picture of prospective customers.



Indian fintech companies are driving change by specialising in targeted services along specific parts of the value chain which were previously the domain of brick and mortar companies

for example aggregators like BankBazaar.com offer a range of services such as loans credit cards deposits and insurance and receive payments from banks for assisting in new business generation

India offers the highest expected return on investment on fintech projects at 29 per cent (not risk adjusted) versus a global average of 20 per cent.143

India's mutual funds segment is sizeable equivalent to approximately one-tenth of the country's GDP144

growth prospects are good given India's high savings rate and its well-developed equity market.

The equity mutual funds market with a boost from demonetisation saw its assets under management cross $430 billion in 2017 double what it was three years earlier

further development in the mutual funds sector will be hampered by modest demand beyond tier one cities a lack of asset class diversity and narrow pension coverage.

India's pension system is at a nascent stage dealing with challenges related to customer awareness penetration and regulation

pension funds under management stand at 1.1 per cent of GDP – compared to 1.5 per cent of GDP in China – and its subscriber base of 8.7 million is a small fraction of the working population 99

India's regulatory framework limits investment avenues for money raised through pensions

however this is changing with the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation granted approval to invest a part of its assets into exchange traded funds.

But the demand for pensions is expected to rise considerably out to 2035 on the back of an increase in the elderly population a higher life expectancy and decrease in the prevalence of the extended family structure

this creates a pressing need to create a robust pension system in India which would raise investment prospects including for foreign companies.

Australia's competitive advantage

Australia has a competitive advantage across three areas of the financial services sector: capital expertise and regulation.

Australia has a financial assets sector worth $8 trillion four and a half times our GDP

our funds management sector with $2.7 trillion under management is the sixth largest pool of funds under management globally and the largest in Asia

the balance of Australia's sovereign wealth fund the Future Fund is approaching $140 billion and has delivered returns of 7.7 per cent per annum since inception.

Australia's highly evolved pension system ranks second in Asia-Pacific on penetration with 70 per cent of the population contributing to a pension scheme

on measures of adequacy sustainability and integrity our pension system is regarded ahead of the United Kingdom United States and Canada

the lack of competition in the Australian market in which less than 5 per cent of Australian members actively switch funds may diminish the appetite for Australia's pension funds to compete overseas.

Australia's deep capital markets and sophisticated financial services system have been built on the back of a strong regulatory system

Australia's regulatory framework has combined a necessary oversight role with the flexibility for industry to innovate and take advantage of new technology

this could be used more effectively as an asset to engage the Indian financial sector.

We are renowned for our financial services acumen and product development

the 2018 Global Financial Centres Index ranked Sydney and Melbourne at 9th and 12th respectively amongst the world's financial centres.xxviii

Australia is a global fintech hub ranking fifth in the world in the 2017 Ernst & Young Fintech Adoption Index

this makes Australia an attractive market for the launch and expansion of fintech products.

1.2 How the sector will likely evolve out to 2035

Growth in foreign investment

Growth in India's financial services sector out to 2035 will be driven by expected increases in FDI and FPI particularly into Indian infrastructure [see Chapter 2: The Investment Story and Chapter 9: Infrastructure Sector].

Despite India's high savings rate the country will be an importer of capital to meet its growth ambitions

while the relaxation of some FDI limits has spurred significant capital inflow in the last 12 to 24 months the double digit return potential across large parts of India's financial services sector including infrastructure has yet to spark the magnitude of foreign investor activity India's Government had hoped.

Foreign investors may be waiting for evidence that Indian policy makers are serious about introducing new financing models to facilitate greater private sector participation

efforts already underway by the Indian Government to attract foreign investment such as the establishment of an equity fund in the form of the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund could help reduce some of the risk profile for foreign investors including from Australia

however India's financial markets have not matured to the point where they can realistically use bonds to fund infrastructure and there is little indication that addressing this will be a priority for Indian governments in the medium term.

New technologies and rising consumer expectations will re-shape the sector globally

The financial services industry is on the cusp of substantial change

rapidly advancing technologies rising consumer expectations and disruptive innovations will reshape the structure of the industry across the globe.

In India the extent to which changes are evolutionary or revolutionary will depend on whether incumbents continue to develop technologies in-house acquire or partner with new entrants to rollout technologies or whether the new products bypass existing intermediaries and markets.

Changes to India's financial system

The pace of change in India's financial system has the potential to be faster than in other countries due to the rapid take up of digital devices combined with India's track record of frugal innovation.

Technology leapfrogging in telecommunications in which India will jump past the fibre cable stage to mobile network infrastructure will be central to the future development of India's financial services sector

mobile phone penetration in India is set to rise to 85–90 per cent by 2020 (from the current levels of 65–75 per cent in 2017) while the smartphone user base is expected to expand to about 500 million people in the same period.98100

Other digitisation projects such as the United Payment Interface and associated mobile application Bharat Interface for Money – a safe instant payment system – and DigiLocker a cloud based platform for authentication and sharing of identity documents will be linked to customers through Aadhaar

the result could revolutionise document processing and enable end-to-end digital credit underwriting.

By 2025 digital finance is forecast to boost India's GDP by $950 billion and create 21 million new jobs.101

With an assist from the demonetisation campaign the digital payments sector in India is expected to benefit the most from rising technological adoption in India

digital payments could grow as much as tenfold to $500 billion by 2020 102 and pass the $1 trillion mark by 2030 103

and pass the $1 trillion mark by 2030 digital banking adoption will also continue its rapid ascent

nearly 80 per cent of all customer transactions in new private banks are conducted through digital channels from 2013–16 the average volume of monthly transactions at ATMs increased 1.5 times EFTPOS by 2.7 times mobile banking by 9.6 times and e-wallets by 11 times.



Adoption of new technologies and processes including blockchain ledgers could reduce the cost of managing loans and make microfinancing commercially feasible

the NITI Aayog-led IndiaChain plans to implement a fully-fledged blockchain infrastructure that uses 'electronic Know Your Customer' and Aadhaar to reduce fraud speed up enforcement of contracts and increase transparency of transactions

microfinancing for commercial purposes will require a change in India's banking culture which has traditionally preferred to lend large amounts to limited clients rather than lending small amounts at scale

while India's incumbent players may not be agile enough to adjust they are unlikely to hinder new firms that may look to service this market.

The need for cyber security and personal data privacy will inform how financial institutions approach off-shoring data storage and the use of big data [see Chapter 13: Defence and Security].

Fintech start-ups are already encroaching on established financial services markets

unencumbered by legacy systems they are developing customer friendly solutions from the ground up

consumers are showing signs of preferring non-traditional financial service providers largely due to more targeted product offerings and a greater focus on customer choice and experience especially in areas of payments loans and personal finance information tools the most successful Indian fintech company to date has been Paytm an electronic payment and e-commerce giant with over 200 million users.



Big data analytics will allow financial service providers to target and tailor products and services with greater precision

firms can anticipate needs price offerings and risk more effectively.

In financial services brand loyalty and effectiveness of discounts will decline as value will increasingly be derived from the degree of personalisation and adaptability of the product

platforms may emerge to give consumers the ability to build a portfolio of financial services from many providers that meets their specific needs

in insurance for example business models could shift from being a reactive claim payer to preventative risk advisor.

CASE STUDY: Insurance Australia Group: Strong prospects in the Indian general insurance market State Bank of India General Insurance Company (SBI General) is a joint venture between Insurance Australia Group (IAG) and the State Bank of India (SBI) India's largest and oldest bank with more than 24000 branches across India. SBI General was established in late 2009 and commenced operations in 2010 building a portfolio in the corporate retail and SME markets across India. SBI owns 74 per cent of SBI General and IAG 26 per cent. IAG has an option to increase its shareholding to 49 per cent following the March 2015 insurance law amendment to the foreign direct investment limit. SBI General has continued to grow strongly and has achieved significant growth from nil revenue in 2010 to $750 million of Gross Written Premium in 2017 reaching 14th in the market with a 2.3 per cent market share. However such successes have not been without challenges. The development stage of the Indian economy and the insurance industry means regulatory frameworks continue to evolve rapidly which creates some uncertainty for investors/shareholders. There is also less concern and protocol in relation to making retrospective regulatory/legal changes. An example would be retrospective changes that impacted foreign shareholders' rights in JV Agreements forcing them to be re-written with rights removed. Cultural differences both generally and commercially also create different processes and benchmarks for assessing what makes good or bad sense in relation to business decisions. Nevertheless enormous growth and significant portions of the market remain untapped. The non-life insurance industry grew by 18.9 per cent in the opening nine months of fiscal year ending 31 March 2018 led by the new government backed agricultural insurance schemes and increased penetration in motor insurance. The healthy growth rate is expected to continue as economic growth boosts disposable income and the insurance market expands to reach more first-time buyers. A rapidly growing middle class is also driving increased insurance penetration and density while a strong development/growth drive in commerce needs to be balanced with profit ambitions.

2.0 Opportunities for partnership

Key judgement Australian industry can benefit from India's financial inclusion drive and economic modernisation by investing in segments of the financial services sector that are open to foreign participation such as general insurance or providing services to enable investment in other sectors such as infrastructure. Australian expertise in financial services may not be transferable on a large scale to an Indian context because of a misalignment in target markets and goal orientation. Australian industry is primarily focused on making a profit and products are geared to a sophisticated investor base whereas India's financial ecosystem has a marked social undertone. Niche opportunities will emerge as India's capital markets mature including in asset management and fintech collaboration. There is also potential for Australian financial institutions to source fintech capabilities and skills from India.

2.1 Export opportunities

Australia's engagement with India's financial services sector has been cautious

in 2016–17 Australia exported $54 million in financial and insurance services to India and imported $31 million.

The biggest opportunities in financial services will be in joint ventures and investment rather than exports.

2.2 Collaboration

Fintech services

Australia and India have complementary strengths in fintech

Australia has emerged as a global fintech hub given our flexible regulatory regime a technology-embracing banking culture and a steady flow of global funding

there is scope for Australian capital and experience to partner with Indian talent to create world-class digital solutions

India has a skilled entrepreneurial pipeline low-cost infrastructure and a large but underpenetrated market India can also benefit from using new technology to leapfrog the legacy systems that may hold back Australian firms.



However differences in goal alignment may limit how this works in practice

India's fintech ecosystem places a greater priority on social development – helping to bank the unbanked or delivering low-cost products and services to the most price-sensitive customers

gaining an understanding of this market will be challenging for Australian fintechs who operate with a more mature market in mind and on a for-profit first basis with products geared to a higher-income retail and corporate market.

There will be niche collaboration opportunities where target markets overlap such as in personal financial information tools commodities trading remittances contract management and export financing

these opportunities will be patchy in the short term and may be hindered by the lack of regulatory clarity in the fintech industry

as fintech standards and governance become clearer and more services enter the mainstream the potential for collaboration will increase.

Many Australian banks are ramping up their in-house fintech capabilities in an effort to provide end to end solutions

the scarcity of specialised technology skills in Australia could lead Australian banks to consider basing their fintech innovation hubs in India where Australian banks think highly of the quality of India's engineering and IT talent

this would also help balance the employment drawdown in India caused by technology cannibalising employment in back office functions

the scale and nature of this opportunity will depend in part on whether the fintech sector will turn into one that primarily competes with established players like banks or collaborates with them.

Australia is ahead of the curve on blockchain technology

blockchain has the potential to remove layers of overhead costs dedicated to confirming authenticity or reconciling transactions between parties in the financial sector

according to a 2016 study by IBM roughly 65 per cent of banks globally are expecting to have blockchain solutions in production by 2020 104

blockchain applications could extend beyond financial services to bring greater transparency and efficiency from energy markets to supply chain logistics.

India is attuned to the need to develop a better understanding of blockchain if the technology is to be used for economic modernisation

while the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is considering the regulatory aspects of the technology Indian banks have undertaken pilot blockchain transactions with other banks

Australia should use this window to initiate cooperation with India as the foundational rules are being set this could build trust for Australia to expand bilateral cooperation and tighten interoperability as applications move beyond financial services to other sectors of the economy.



Asset management

The opportunity for Australian asset managers to partner with Indian mutual funds companies will be a medium term one

it will depend on a steep change in financial literacy in India as well as an increase in pension fund and insurance subscription

mutual funds are not currently the investment vehicle of choice for Indian households making up only 3 per cent of total investment in financial assets by Indians.105

As the Indian market matures Australian businesses could combine capital and expertise in using technology to develop consumer-centric products and expand distribution networks

even as the Indian investor market becomes more sophisticated the typical asset allocation will look vastly different to that of Australia

investment houses with expertise in non-core assets and venture capital would be more suited to India.

As with any joint venture arrangement particularly in India partner selection and goal alignment is paramount

foreign firms that have entered the asset management sector without a local partner have often exited the market

challenges include a lack of brand awareness in smaller cities and an inability to expand distribution networks without significant upfront cost and time commitments.

Australia is world-leading in asset management bolstered by a sophisticated investor base strong financial institutions innovative products and a mandatory superannuation scheme

but Australian asset managers may see little value in expanding into challenging overseas markets like India as they benefit enormously from the flow of compulsory contributions in the domestic sector

moreover the relatively small size of Australia's asset management firms may make it more difficult to enter into a mutually beneficial joint partnership with a substantially larger Indian partner.

Policy and regulatory cooperation

We should improve institutional ties in financial services segments where both Australia is world-leading and India is reform-leaning

government engagement could facilitate the entry of more Australian players in this space and improve growth prospects for Australian companies investing in India's financial services sector and vice versa

India will also have opportunities to absorb regulatory best practice through their exposure to the Basel process and Financial Stability Board.

The most prospective area for regulatory cooperation is in fintech

India is in the early stages of developing its fintech regulatory architecture

the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is well placed to work with India on fintech regulatory cooperation.

Both countries will also benefit from establishing robust international standards in the blockchain industry which will provide market confidence and trust that proprietary information and money will remain safe

it will help provide a common language for industry policy makers regulators and technology developers and the basis for interoperability as the use of blockchain expands.

Cyber security

Financial services organisations face some of the most challenging threats to their cybersecurity as the convenience of modern consumer banking – including ATMs point-of-sale systems and mobile banking – has vastly increased the number of endpoints that need to be protected

banks are also responsible for some of the most sensitive consumer and corporate data and risk serious reputational damage in case of a breach

the banking sector is the largest user of cybersecurity products and services in Australia.

While cyber security is a nascent industry in Australia Australia's well-functioning and effective cyber security entities can tap into the cyber security segment in India in software services and training [see Chapter 13: Defence and Security].

2.3 Investment

Institutional investment

There is significant attention but little knowledge in India of Australian super funds beyond headline figures of funds under management

but Australian institutional investors are generally domestically focused weighted towards equities and have an eye to short term results.

An average of 30 per cent of Australian super fund investments are in equities where returns are expected to decline

these funds may eventually seek alternate investment options in higher growth markets such as India which could emerge as a high-risk high-return option.

Investors looking to boost returns could also consider the Future Fund's approach to India

the Future Fund readily acknowledges the challenges of investing in India including the legal system ease of doing business and regulatory barriers

but the Future Fund's footprint in India is increasing with investments across a number of asset classes

it holds a long term outlook and is diversified across asset class and geographies and recognises India's long term growth potential strong economic structural reform agenda and ongoing political stability.

General insurance

The projected increase in insurance take-up in India out to 2035 provides an opportunity in the medium term for Australian companies to tap into India's general insurance market

within general insurance health insurance is projected to experience the fastest growth the health insurance premium share of total general insurance is expected to increase from 22 per cent in 2013 to up to 31 per cent by 2025. 97



India is seeking foreign capital and expertise in digital distribution to support local firms to expand into regional and rural areas

foreign firms that specialise in servicing a mature market have opted to acquire stakes in local companies rather than establishing a joint venture or foreign subsidiary

this provides access to an established brand and distribution network without the upfront costs and time involved to build a presence and on-the-ground relationships.

Opportunities for Australian companies in the insurance sector will be hindered by the ongoing market dominance of Indian state-owned enterprises

Australian insurance firms looking to enter the Indian market may wish to consider joint ventures with Indian state-owned firms.

Joint venture arrangements in the insurance sector have worked for those prepared to invest time and align business cultures and personnel

an increase in the FDI cap for insurance in 2015 from 26 per cent to 49 per cent has already seen foreign players invest – including Australian firms – in strong Indian general insurance companies for example Insurance Australia Group and India's SBI General Insurance

other Australian firms may need to wait until FDI norms are relaxed further to find the right opportunity to meaningfully participate in this sector.

3.0 Constraints and challenges

Key judgement India's financial services sector is heavily regulated and dominated by state-owned enterprises. Though foreign investment caps are likely to be relaxed out to 2035 structural inefficiencies and red tape will linger. The constraints to growth in this sector are not one sided. Australia's institutional investment industry is by and large preoccupied by short term wins and incentives that work against India's value proposition. Sustained improvements in India's ease of doing business sovereign governance arrangements and in the India literacy of Australian companies and boards will help.

3.1 The policy and regulatory environment

India's financial services industry is heavily regulated by a range of authorities many of which are averse to foreign debt and foreign players

the RBI SEBI Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority all have regulatory power in the sector

extensive regulatory requirements for the formation of new companies in the banking financial services and insurance sector have long posed a barrier to entry for prospective companies.

CASE STUDY: ANZ: Recognising India's Potential Recognising the long term potential and growth of India's economy ANZ opened a branch in Mumbai in 2011 and subsequently established branches in Gurugram and Bengaluru. Through these branches ANZ provides corporate banking services to institutional customers both local and from offshore that allow them to conduct financial transactions across the region and into Europe and the United States. ANZ services include Indian Rupee and foreign currency working capital and term financing transaction banking foreign exchange and interest rate solutions offshore debt capital markets and deposits. With its local knowledge and global expertise ANZ India aims to help clients achieve the results they want from the movement of their capital and goods across the region. It provides services to customers in the resources energy agriculture financial institutions and technology sectors. As well as its branch based operations ANZ has a shared services hub in Bengaluru supporting its businesses across Australia New Zealand and Asia. ANZ also provides financial and volunteering support to non-government organisations and charities in India. ANZ's flagship adult financial education program MoneyMinded is delivered in Mumbai and Bengaluru where it continues to help hundreds of participants improve their financial skills knowledge and confidence.

The complex regulatory environment particularly impinges on India's emerging fintech sector

new regulatory hurdles such as protocols around 'know your customer' and anti-money laundering as well as digital identity authentication and data storage requirements slow the adoption of new technologies.

Like their global peers Indian regulators are still figuring out how to recalibrate to innovative disruptions

the treatment of new business models enabled by fintech including peer-to-peer transactions crypto-currencies crowd funding systems integrity and data security are the biggest grey areas

the lack of a regulatory framework makes significant investment in fintech a risk for Australian businesses.

The Future Fund Australia's biggest institutional investor in India has also suffered from a lack of regulatory clarity

SEBI's 2012 'clubbing' rule which brings the Future Fund and a range of state government funds under the same banner effectively limits Future Fund holdings to 2.5 per cent of any listed entity whereas a single foreign portfolio investor would be able to hold 10 per cent.xxix

India has made notable recent progress in reducing FDI caps in some sectors

in 2015 the FDI limit on pensions and insurance increased from 26 per cent to 49 per cent

in 2016 the limit in 'other financial services' category which includes fintech and asset management increased to 100 per cent

India will need to go much further in opening up the financial services sector to foreign investment if it wants to increase capital inflows and accelerate adoption of world-leading technology and practices in these sectors.

Opportunities in the retail banking sector are curtailed by the dominance of public sector banks and the prevalence of many local private sector banks

some foreign banks have succeeded in India but many have exited including Australian banks

those Australian banks with a presence in India primarily service corporates and HNWIs from Mumbai and New Delhi or outsource back office functions India would need to secure investment from big name firms in Australia New Zealand and other parts of the Indo-Pacific for significant opportunities to emerge for Australian firms in India's retail banking sector.



3.2 Skills infrastructure and other constraints

The financial inclusion needs of India's rural poor are unlikely to be met by Australian firms

this cohort will be serviced almost entirely by domestic financial institutions

the reach of private and foreign banks into rural areas and financial inclusion is very low

of the total distribution of credit from all private sector banks in India in 2017 only 2.39 per cent was distributed to rural areas; for foreign banks that figure was 0.35 per cent.

There are also constraints on the Australian side such as benchmark-led management and shareholder expectations which can favour shorter term thinking in the institutional investment sector

the culture of quarterly reporting constrains firms from investing in emerging markets such as India where bouts of heightened volatility make members and boards nervous around performance.

4.0 Where to focus

Unlike many other industries the financial services market in India is a national market in which businesses do not have to rely upon the business conditions set by state governments. Nevertheless India does have well-formed financial services and fintech clusters. These cities should be the entry point for Australian companies seeking to establish a presence in the market. In the medium term Indian cities with the greatest unmet demand for capital and insurance are unlikely to offer the best prospects for the types of financial services in which Australia specialises. Australian efforts should also focus on the Central Government to bridge knowledge and expectation gaps and share regulatory expertise.

Much like other parts of the world India's financial services sector has a high spatial concentration in one city – Mumbai

the city is India's financial and corporate capital housing the headquarters of regulators including SEBI and the RBI

by extension the state of Maharashtra of which Mumbai is the capital is the most relevant for Australian financial services firms seeking to establish a presence in India.

The clustering of IT firms in Hyderabad (Telangana) and start-up culture in Bengaluru (Karnataka) has led to the emergence of a strong fintech ecosystem in both cities

Telangana is also home to T-Hub India's largest start-up incubator.

Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are key states for fintech partnerships given the development of a fintech hub in each state and the existence of a strong IT and fintech ecosystem respectively.

Recognising its wide-ranging potential to modernise the economy New Delhi Kerala and Rajasthan are committing to develop blockchain specialisation hubs.",,,,,,

Sunday January 16 2022

Number 12

Monday we celebrate the enduring legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

During his all-too-short life Dr. King worked tirelessly to ensure that equality justice peace respect and inclusion were a part of our lives. These ideals are reflected in our community.

Something Dr. King said continues to resonate with me. He said “You don’t have to see the whole staircase. Just take the first step.”

We are poised to do great things in our community. We are taking those crucial first steps in making changes that will make a generational impact.

Our new Equity Housing and Human Services (EHHS) Department will play a key role in impacting the lives of so many of our neighbors. Its creation now unites several divisions dedicated to improving the livability of our most vulnerable populations.

I appointed Preeti Shridhar to lead the department. In her words “It is not just to embrace a message of inclusion and hope but of real action. So we proposed a plan and on Monday City Council approved it. We will soon distribute $1.5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to help community members in real need receive basic human services.”

In addition to the new department and many other efforts underway we are also in the process of interviewing candidates for a new Equity Commission. This group will help ensure we listen to our residents and identify and remove barriers.

Your City Council reflects the makeup and values of our city. Though they come from different backgrounds they are united in their service and representation to our residents.

One of the goals they recently amended in the city’s 2022-2027 Business Plan is to “Build an inclusive informed and hate-free city with equitable outcomes for all in support of social economic and racial justice.”

I hope you’ll join me as we celebrate Dr. King’s legacy. We must continue working to make Renton a community committed to his ideals and dedicated to making lives better every day.

City Council approves reallocation of the $1.5 million appropriation for equity housing and human services support

As I mentioned above the City Council on Monday approved the reallocation of $1.5 million appropriation to support the work of our Equity Housing and Human Services Department (EHHS). The money was made available from reserves freed up by using the city’s American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding to support general governmental services.

The funds will be distributed immediately to:

Agencies serving those in dire need because of COVID

Smaller agencies reaching minority populations through Renton Regional Community Foundation

Expanded Human Services needs through Village of Hope

REACH (Renton Ecumenical Association of Churches)

Additional staff support

A reserve will help fund implementation of the upcoming citywide Human Needs Assessment plan. The last assessment was completed in 2014.

“Our city has undergone significant change since then and that made us refocus our priorities” EHHS administrator Preeti Shridhar told the council. “It’s not enough to do an assessment. You must be able to fund the critical needs it identifies.” The city is in the process of accepting proposals to conduct the assessment.

Workers are demanding higher wages on a par with other Republic Services workers and safer working conditions from a company that is the second-largest landfill and trash collection corporation in the country.

Members of Teamsters Local 542 voted 136 to 86 to reject the offer.

“One of the bigger issues” Cesar Silva a worker who voted no told CBS8-TV at the union hall is “our pension and our wages. And the discomfort we have as drivers now in our equipment.” The strike began Dec. 17.

Republic settled a contract recently in Orange County with raises of over $2 an hour the first year and $1 for each succeeding year of the contract but they have refused to match that offer to the workers in San Diego. The bosses claim that the area’s closeness to Mexico means the cost of living is lower there.

Drivers also say unsafe conditions on the trucks and the frequent refusal of the company to fix them has to change.

“In 2020 Republic Services earned over $10 billion with $1.2 billion in net profit while its CEO’s total compensation totaled over $12 million” the Teamsters said in a press statement. “Republic’s largest shareholder is Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Gates’ investment advisor sits on Republic’s board of directors.”

As uncollected garbage piles up Republic said they’re bringing in scabs to replace workers on strike. They are using a special group called the “Blue Crew” which is used specifically to act as strikebreakers when there is a labor dispute. But piles of trash still abound in the area stinking and attracting rats.

Mary Salas the mayor of Chula Vista where Republic has its largest San Diego-area facility has come out in favor of the strike. “Our trash collectors many of whom are Chula Vista residents deserve a fair contract” she told KGTV.

Salas also spoke with CBS8 noting the company’s move to use strikebreakers. “I have full support for the sanitation workers” she said. “They are striking and rightly so.” She added that the next time the city negotiates with Republic over their services she intends to push for greater protection for the workers.

Officials have set a City Council meeting on the strike Jan. 11 and the union plans to attend and hold a rally outside City Hall.

“Our members have been working nonstop throughout the pandemic to keep San Diego communities clean and safe” Jaime Vasquez secretary-treasurer of Local 542 said in a union press release. “They have been pushed to the brink by excessive working hours and harassment by company management.”

“It’s no surprise that our members voted down Republic’s current contract proposal” Vasquez said. “In addition it was a slap in the face to learn that Republic gave its board members hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and stock this week.”

“The only way the City of Chula Vista is going to get cleaned up is for us to go back to work” Laderer Hampton a striker and driver who’s been with Republic Services for 16 years told CBS8. “Not the Blue Crew us. The drivers right here that’s picketing.”

In addition to the San Diego area Teamster members at Republic Services are in negotiations for contracts that expired in 2021 in San Francisco; Seattle; New Orleans; and San Jose Stockton and Richmond California.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdm9pY2VvZnNhbmRpZWdvLm9yZy8yMDIyLzAxLzE2L3doYXQtd2UtbGVhcm5lZC1hYm91dC1uYXZpZ2F0aW5nLXNjaG9vbGluZy1hbmQtY292aWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What We Learned About Navigating Schooling and COVID,"Class is back in session for most students in San Diego — and for many it’s not going well.

The rapid rise in coronavirus cases across the region has left schools scrambling to find substitutes forced districts to cut back on extracurricular activities and prompted notices of possible disruptions in school transportation.

Late Thursday San Diego Unified leaders sent parents an email with a clear message: The impact of staff shortages will only get worse in the coming weeks.

“For the next month we have authorized principals to use other certificated staff to supervise students when teachers and substitutes are unavailable … Principals are taking other measures as well including moving students outdoors during good weather and into large indoor spaces” read the email.

Officials said no one should anticipate a district-wide return to online learning. Instead San Diego Unified will consult with the county on a threshold for when individual schools may need to be closed.

“This is not the return to normal that many of us were hoping for at the start of the school year but we have effective planning in place a strong team to implement those plans and the full support of our beloved community” officials wrote.

With so much uncertainty around schools we asked parents to share their experience over the past few weeks and what they wish their district would explain better. Here are a few of their responses edited for clarity.

Katie Matchett whose children attend Sessions Elementary in Pacific Beach said back to school guidance was difficult to interpret when one of her kids tested positive.

“The official communication from school was ‘call for instructions if someone tests positive’— I spent four hours trying to get through … When I was eventually able to contact the school nurse via email I was told it was fine for my healthy kid to go to school. But our neighbors down the street with the exact same scenario were told to keep their healthy child home for nearly 3 weeks. I’m seeing this play out with other families and schools as well with conflicting guidance from schools adding to the stress and confusion of an already difficult situation.”

Mark Lane whose kids attend Vernon Elementary and Lemon Grove Academy Middle School estimated this week that both schools had an absentee rate of about 40 percent with many teachers and staff out sick.

“Why are we not on a few weeks of remote learning? Why are we exposing the teachers staff and kids?” he asked.

Mary a parent at High Tech High in Clairemont Mesa reiterated that attendance is low.

“(On the) first day back from Christmas break 20 percent of students did not come back. Numbers have slowly been growing since then” she said adding that she would like a guarantee from the district that schools will remain open.

On a more positive note Lisa Deaton whose children attend Waldorf School of San Diego told us she thinks the school has done a good job handling COVID because classes there have been held outdoors since fall 2020.

“I feel safe with my children attending school” she said. “Classes are small in size and masks are mandatory. Testing is available to all students staff and family every week. So while things have not been normal we have been able to be in person longer than other schools in San Diego.”

The Week’s Top News

Mayor Todd Gloria laid out big priorities this week during his State of the City address. He urged the city to tackle tough challenges like homelessness and crumbling city infrastructure as it emerges from the pandemic.

Chula Vista leaders are ready to declare a state of emergency hoping it will help end the standoff between sanitation workers and Republic Services. But as Jesse Marx explained this week the city has little leverage . The city’s contract with Republic Services stipulates that the company isn’t at fault for any “uncontrollable circumstance” which includes a strike.

In other South Bay news we learned that Chula Vista Councilman John McCann filed a complaint accusing Mayor Mary Casillas Salas of discrimination and harassment because she called him a “gringo.” The city spent $16K to settle the dispute  with an outside attorney concluding it didn’t rise to the level of harassment or discrimination.

Read These Comments

On San Diego Unified’s decision to shut down extracurricular and off-season sports …

“Having less activity is absolutely the wrong thing to do … As a PE teacher less activity only leads to more problems but the geniuses in the district have little or no clue to this. They are under the impression that hiding in a hole like a groundhog will save anyone from anything. Increased activity equals increased oxygen capacity heart function and overall wellness.” – kkaponis

“To the best of my knowledge no one has suggested kids stop exercising have they? Perhaps the lesson here is listen up grownups if kids don’t have them already they learn not only independent exercise discipline and skills but the seemingly forgotten principle that the health of the greater community is more important than adult-programmed extracurricular game time?” – Jerry Hall

On Chula Vista’s trash strike …

“It just seems that Republic Services has little concern for the public they serve and the contract with the City of Chula Vista is manipulative in that it allows the corporation to keep revenues flowing even during a labor dispute.” – Richard Barry

On Chula Vista spending $16K to investigate the mayor’s use of “gringo” …

“Such a shame that so much money was wasted on this. Sounds like the conclusion that was reached is pretty much right thankfully but still. In my opinion if “gringo” is used with a disparaging tone or in a negative context it’s not appropriate for the workplace but it’s still definitely not discrimination or worthy of investigation. As others have commented this is definitely white fragility in action.” – Becky Winkler

Santa Ana High School’s boys soccer team capitalized on a strong offensive effort in the first half en route to a 3-1 Orange Coast League win over Estancia Friday evening at Jim Scott Stadium.

With goals from Alex Garcia Ozzie Becerra and Brian Mendez-Maravilla via penalty kick Santa Ana was able to take the lead into halftime and relied on its long ball possessions and stingy defense to seal the deal.

Both Santa Ana (7-3-5 3-0-1) and Estancia (3-10-1 3-1) came into the contest undefeated in Orange Coast League play with the opportunity to take sole possession of first place.

In the initial minutes both teams cancelled each other out in the midfield battle and relied on speed and long crosses but with little action taking place inside the 18-yard boxes in the first half hour of play. The game also carried heavy physical play and chippy tackles that heated both sets of the sidelines.

It wasn’t until the last 10 minutes of play that both offenses came to life. García’s strike in the 28th minute put the Saints ahead but two minutes later the Eagles capitalized on a loose ball inside Santa Ana’s box when forward Felix Solis tapped in the equalizer.

After conceding Santa Ana managed to add pressure on the flanks in the final minutes of the first half and that enabled crosses that put pressure on the Estancia defense. It was in one of those crosses that Becerra headed in the go-ahead goal for the Saints. A few minutes later Mendez-Maravilla kicked a powerful penalty kick shot to the center of the net to beat the Estancia goalkeeper Ceasar Pedroza who up until the last 10 minutes of the half had been flawless for the Eagles.

“I was proud of the team’s effort today. We had a lot of different players contribute. It was a complete team effort” said Santa Ana Coach Joe Peñaflor. “There is still a lot of work to be done with six league games remaining. We will need to continue to improve. The victory gives us momentum to build on.”

In the second half Estancia attempted to make a run at the game but the Santa Ana defense neutralized the attack and wrapped up the victory.

“I thought we played well. It was a tough game. They definitely outplayed us the first half and we were a lot more even in the second half. My boys showed a lot of resilience in the second half” said Estancia Coach Robert Castellano.

Turns out the BBC One series — now airing in the United States on Discovery and streaming on Discovery+ — has had two narrators over the years. Bill Paterson lent his voice to the first season before taking a break for a couple years letting Robert Pugh man the commentary for three seasons. And in a fun coincidence one of those actors appeared on the HBO megahit Game of Thrones while the other will appear on GOT’s upcoming spinoff House of the Dragon.

Bill has narrated more than 125 episodes of The Repair Shop so far narrating the first season in 2017 and returning in 2019 to emcee Season 5 onward according to his IMDb filmography. And he’s responsible for the “soft Glaswegian tones” that contribute to The Repair Shop’s comforting nature as Metro notes.

A Glasgow native Bill has been an actor for more than a half-century now. He starred as Crown Prosecution Service Director George Castle in Law & Order: UK he portrayed lawyer Ned Gowan in Outlander and he played the father in Fleabag. His Fleabag role earned him a SAG Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. On the big screen the 76-year-old has appeared in The Witches How to Lose Friends & Alienate People and Miss Potter.

Coming up Paterson will play Lord Lyman Beesbury in House of the Dragon who is the Lord of Honeyholt and Master of Coin on King Viserys’s small council in the Game of Thrones prequel series as HBO explains. The series will premiere later this year.

Robert Pugh narrated the show from Season 2 to Season 4.

The Repair Shop’s other narrator who gave voiceovers for 62 episodes between 2018 and 2019 is Welch actor Robert Pugh. These days Robert is perhaps best known for playing Free Folk member Craster a rough-edged ally of the Night Watch north of the Wall in the second and third seasons of Game of Thrones.

The 71-year-old also had notable roles in the 2003 movie Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World and the 2010 film Robin Hood both of which starred Russell Crowe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHA6Ly9qYW1haWNhLmxvb3BuZXdzLmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2pvY2tleS1yb2JlcnQtaGFsbGVkZWVuLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zcGFya2xlLWluY2x1ZGluZy1hYm9hcmQtb25lLWRvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jockey Robert Halledeen continues to sparkle including aboard One Don | Loop Jamaica,"Robert Halledeen rode back-to-back winners for the third consecutive meet on Sunday including Gary Subratie’s hot favourite ONE DON in an overnight-allowance sprint at six furlongs.

As seen in the Twitter post below WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns and challenger to his title at Royal Rumble Seth Rollins teased the fans when the cameras went off the air last night.

As noted the main event segment to last night's WWE SmackDown included Rollins and Roman Reigns in a war of words. Just before things got physical Reigns even said that if he wanted to main event Royal Rumble with a megastar he should face Rollins' wife WWE RAW Women's Champion Becky Lynch.

The two men seemed about to come to blows when the SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos suddenly tried to attack Seth Rollins from behind. Instead he ducked the attack and evaded any harm as he made his way back up the entrance ramp. On the stage Rollins said he created Roman Reigns and now he will destroy him.

But once the cameras stopped rolling Rollins ran down to the ring to fearlessly confront Roman once more. With the Usos down Reigns entertained the idea by climbing on the ring apron. But as the fans all stood and got excited Reigns then retreated and started making his way to the back. The video clips just as one of the Usos is about to connect with a superkick on Seth Rollins.

Eddyfi completed the purchase of Zetec from Roper Technologies Inc.Eddyfi

One of Quebec’s emerging corporate champions infrastructure diagnostic testing technology provider Eddyfi NDT Inc. is looking to raise up to US$500-million after closing its 11th acquisition in five years.

Eddyfi last week completed the purchase of Zetec from Sarastoa Fla.-based Roper Technologies Inc. for US$350-million the latest effort by the Quebec City company to consolidate its fragmented industry. Eddyfi uses a mix of software and hardware technology to test pipelines power plants refineries and other infrastructure for cracks and defects. Zetec based near Seattle is in the same business known as “non-destructive testing” serving power generation and aerospace operators.

Eddyfi is one of a slew of Canadian technology companies that have gone on a global buying binge. Other recent acquirers of foreign companies include Dye & Durham Lightspeed Commerce Coveo Solutions SemiosBio Technologies Clio FreshBooks Magnet Forensics and Intelerad Medical Systems. They contributed to a record number of cross-border deals for the sector in 2021 according to Refinitiv.

“I know a lot of [Canadians] sold their businesses to the first American that came with their chequebook” in the past Eddyfi chief executive officer Martin Thériault said in an interview. “It’s good to be building a business that buys” abroad instead.

It has also helped to have Quebec’s biggest financiers behind him similar to the support enjoyed by other Quebec tech firms including Lightspeed and Nuvei. Mr. Thériault a mechanical engineer and industrial executive-turned-entrepreneur founded Eddyfi in 2009 and self-financed the company until 2017 when he raised $36.5-million from the Caisse de dépot et placement du Québec. Three years later he raised another $600-million in debt and equity from the Caisse private-equity firm Novacap LP National Bank of Canada and the province’s Investissement Québec arm. That funded Eddyfi’s 2020 acquisitions of European pipeline inspection companies NDT Global and Halfwave AS which tripled its annual revenue to $300-million

Eddyfi financed its latest deal with debt underwritten by National Bank with IQ chipping in US$60-million. “Our government is proud to assist [Eddyfi] with this acquisition” through IQ provincial Economy and Innovation Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said in a release. IQ CEO Guy LeBlanc stated: “As part of our commitment to strategic sectors of our economy our teams support Quebec companies every day with their growth and market development projects outside our borders.”

The Zetec acquisition has a personal angle for Mr. Thériault: He used to head its Canadian operations and left in 2009 after it downsized operations here. He started Eddyfi to fill the gap it left in the Canadian market with Zetec’s blessing “because I was taking care of their problem” he said.

“We were less than $1-million [in revenue] 12 years ago” at Eddyfi he said “Now we’re five times the size” of Zetec. He described the price for Zetec as “stiff but because we were a strategic buyer and knew the business it made sense for us.”

Zetec generated US$64-million in revenue in the 12 months through last August and had operating earnings of US$17-million. With the acquisition Eddyfi will have US$350-million in combined annual revenue and 1500 employees. Organic revenue from existing businesses is growing by more than 10 per cent and operating profit as a share of revenue amounts to “better than in the 20s” Mr. Thériault said. He added Eddyfi expects to achieve US$5-million to US$10-million in annual cost synergies.

Novacap partner David Lewin said Eddyfi is well positioned to consolidate an industry of profitable stable and modestly-sized companies that can help extend the life span of large-scale assets such as bridges nuclear power plant dams and other infrastructure assets. That makes it a play in the burgeoning environmental social and governance space. “We believe these tailwinds are super compelling and they’re applicable to more and more verticals as this infrastructure evolves and ages” Mr. Lewin said.

Mr. Thériault said he expected Eddyfi would raise US$300-million to US$500-million this year in equity either from private backers or by going public to repay debt “and position us for growth” through mergers and acquisitions. He said the timing could be dictated by how deals now in the works play out.

Mr. Lewin said Eddyfi will raise funds when “we have a natural reason to do so. … We want to make sure the company is well-equipped and is never in a position where it has a ball and chains to not execute on an amazing opportunity. … Down the road we’ll need to open up the capital to ensure we don’t miss out.”

Analysts say Rack has an inventory problem and suffers by being connected to a full-price brand.

We visited three Racks to find out more.

Just two years ago Nordstrom's discount chain Nordstrom Rack was considered to be the company's biggest asset outperforming and outgrowing its full-price business in sales and store locations.

But increasingly it has become a lag on the company's earnings reporting an 8.1% drop in sales over 2019 in the most recent quarter while its rivals TJ Maxx and Ross Stores continue to thrive.

Analysts say the store has become chaotic and overrun with inventory. Nordstrom didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

We visited three Nordstrom Rack stores in two parts of the US to find out more about the shopping experience.

Handbags galore. Insider/Dominick Reuter

Our first impressions of one of its stores in Madison Wisconsin were good. Clothing racks were neatly organized and employees were actively keeping displays in check.

The store was neat and tidy. Insider/Dominick Reuter

There seemed to be a good assortment of recognizable brands and the selection wasn't overwhelming.

Still some of the clothing seemed to be well out of season. Handy for those hitting hotter climates but less so for locals taking on the cruel midwestern winter.

Next we headed to a Nordstrom Rack in Manhattan's Midtown district.

The store is close to the busy Herald Square shopping area key tourist attractions such as the Empire State Building and a ton of offices meaning that there are lots of different customers to appeal to.

Handbags were neatly arranged. Insider/Brittany Chang

Our initial impressions were also positive. Commonly messy parts of the store were kept in good order.

And there seemed to be an appropriate amount of inventory on sale without racks being overstuffed.

Some of the signage in the store didn't match the clothing on offer however possibly indicating that the store is using different items to cover up inventory gaps.

And the displays were more disheveled than in other stores.

Still it was fairly organized for an off-price store where customers are likely to be riffling through the racks to find the best deals.

GlobalData Retail analyst Neil Saunders has blamed the store's current woes on the lack of discipline in its buying team. ""It's almost as if Nordstrom just acquires lots of stuff which it then shoves into stores"" he told Insider.

BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel told Insider that Nordstrom Rack is also at a disadvantage to its competitors TJ Maxx and Ross for example because the company operates full-price stores too.

Madewell basics made an appearance. Insider/Brittany Chang

This means that its Rack locations can be used to sell leftover inventory from full-price stores rather than inventory that's been bought at a discount which is what TJ Maxx would do. That leads to weaker margins for Nordstrom.

Nordstrom's management team has addressed Rack's weakness in recent earnings calls and partly blamed this on difficulty securing inventory because of current supply chain issues.

Insider/Brittany Chang

But Siegel said it's also harder for Rack to attract brands because it has an online store. ""Brands prefer the invisible sale done at TJ Maxx"" he said. ""If you are a brand looking to move product through off-price seeing it online is a different proposition to believing you can drop boxes off at a TJ Maxx without anyone knowing.""

Even as the pandemic is raging around the world and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a stark warning telling Americans to avoid travel on cruise ships regardless of their vaccination status Atlantis insists that its vaccination mandate testing requirements and health protocols are enough to provide a safe environment for guests throughout the voyage. Many passengers are convinced.

“It’s time to start living our lives again and vaccines and tests allow us to do that.

In a letter to guests Royal Caribbean said the voyage had been cancelled due to itinerary planning changes.

The company sent a letter to guests detailing the options guests will have instead of the cruise including several Caribbean cruises and refund options. The arrival of Allure of the Seas would have coincided with the inaugural season for a new cruise terminal under construction in Galveston.

Allure of the Seas Repositioning Cruise Cancelled

It’s only January yet already Royal Caribbean has decided to cancel an 8-night repositioning cruise in November from Allure‘s homeport of Fort Lauderdale to her new homeport of Galveston Texas. The cruise line sent out a letter to guests booked on the voyage saying the cancellation was due to a change in itinerary planning.

The ship will be arriving in Galveston Texas a few days earlier than planned making the 8-night voyage impossible. The trip scheduled to sail on November 5 had included two port calls to Aruba and Curacao in the Dutch Caribbean and was due to arrive in Galveston on November 13 2022.

Royal Caribbean said the following: “Due to a change in itinerary planning Allure of the Seas will now be arriving into Galveston a few days earlier than previously scheduled. Unfortunately this means your cruise has been cancelled. We know how much time and effort go into planning your vacation and we’re terribly sorry for the impact to your cruise.”

Allure of the Seas will call Galveston her new home and be one of the first ships to use a new $125 million new terminal building constructed especially for Royal Caribbean. The new terminal’s completion date comes together with the arrival of Allure of the Seas.

Allure is the second Oasis-class cruise ship at 225282 gross tons and a guest capacity of 5484 at double occupancy and 2200 crew members. The new terminal was needed to handle such large passenger and crew numbers.

Royal Caribbean Offers Rebooking and Refunding Options

Guests who booked the repositioning cruise in November have been offered several different options for rebooking their cruise or receiving a full refund. Guests can choose from an 8-Night Southern Caribbean cruise with calls in Haiti Aruba and Curacao; a 6-night cruise to Roatan Costa Maya and Cozumel; or a 7-night cruise to Puerto Plata Labadee Nassau and Perfect Day at CocoCay.

These cruises include the original stateroom category at the original cruise fare rate. Royal Caribbean will refund the difference if the new cruise is cheaper and guests have already paid in full.

Guests will also receive an onboard credit of $100 for interior ocean view or balcony Staterooms $200 for suites and an additional $50 for any additional guests. The company will also cover any transportation change fees that guests incur due to changes of up to $200 for domestic travel and $400 for international travel.

Guests can also book any other Royal Caribbean cruise but they will be responsible for any difference in pricing to the cruise fare taxes fees gratuities and other non-cruise fare items. As with the above option any discrepancies to the cruise rate if cheaper will be refunded. The cruise line also offers the transportation refund option.

The CEO of one of the world's largest cruise lines has said that cruise holidays have been unfairly singled out by the media and were a victim of their own strict health reporting standards.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings chief executive Frank Del Rio said cruising had become the target of ""cheap headlines"".

The cruise line boss took fire at the media last Friday saying ships had been singled out during the Covid-19 pandemic due to their industry's robust health reporting.

Del Rio said it was lazy sensationalist journalism ""taking advantage of the fact that our industry offers robust testing that we track cases and that we diligently report them to the CDC and other public health administrations.""

Ships docking in the US are required to report to the CDC all illness onboard for crew and passengers.

During a virtual conversation with travel advisors Del Rio was keen to overturn perceptions that cruise travel was any less safe than other forms of travel in the emergence of the omicron variant.

""It's something that no other industries are required to do -- not hotels resorts theme parks airlines or any other part of hospitality.""

In a letter to investors cruise line operators Royal Caribbean Group published its infection rates since fully vaccinated sailings were introduced: ""Since cruising restarted in the US in June 2021 the Royal Caribbean Group has carried 1.1 million guests with 1745 people testing positive—a positivity rate of 0.02 percent.""

'Cruise Ban' continues in New Zealand in 2022

The year started badly for cruise companies. On 4 January the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a Level 4 warning against cruise travel.

""Even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading Covid-19 variants"" the CDC warned.

This weekend the 'conditional sailing order' expired allowing cruises to resume.

While the health agency still considers cruise travel ""high risk"" companies are no longer required to follow the no sail order.

While the reporting of illness is far better on cruise ships and the risk is much better known it has not put insurers' minds at ease.

Travel involving cruise transport is still uninsurable with many providers.

For travellers who choose to go ahead with cruise travel the CDC advises they get fully vaccinated including a booster shot - a condition of carriage for most cruise companies - and get tested three days before and after the trip as well as practising distancing and hygiene measures on board.

In New Zealand the Maritime Border Order continues to freeze out international liners although smaller expeditionary cruises have resumed.

Even when the ban on cruise travel is lifted the restart for New Zealand will require careful planning says the New Zealand Cruise Association.

""The most realistic estimate is that New Zealand cruising will not begin until the last quarter of 2022"" predicted Kevin O'Sullivan CEO of NZCA.

Until then the cruise industry will continue to follow the CDC's voluntary Covid-19 measures to ""instil confidence in the sailing public that cruising is safe"".",,,,,,

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWFjY291bnRhbnQtamVmZnJleS1zLW1jY29ubmV5LW9uLWhpcy1zdG9ybXktZGFuaWVscy1jb3ZlcnVwLW5vdGVzLWktbWFkZS1hLWJvby1ib2_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump Accountant on His Stormy Daniels Coverup Notes: 'I Made a Boo-Boo',"Jurors who will determine Donald Trump’s fate got their first look at the damning paperwork tying the former president to his porn star hush-money coverup with testimony from the buffoon accountant who took notes of a meeting that set it in motion.

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Ranked number three in the league as of publishing the Dallas Cowboys will be stepping onto tonight's field at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington Texas with a suspected edge over the ninth-ranked San Francisco 49ers — but here's hoping the legions of Faithful 49ers who took the trip south to support the SF team will help push the odds in our favor during this Wild Card game.

quarantines have reinforced the value of the home. The expectations of

homeowners and renters have risen as they seek fully functioning homes that

include space to live work and play in. The commercial real estate space in

turn is also affected as the growth of remote and/or hybrid work is causing

significant shifts in the use of real estate.

ConTech and PropTech refer to the intersection of ‘property’

and ‘technology’ and ‘construction’ and ‘technology’ respectively. These industry

areas correspond to the vast ecosystem of startups and emerging growth

companies that offer technologies and/or innovative products services and

business models across the real estate market.

Israel the ""Startup Nation"" is one of the

countries leading the way in ConTech and PropTech. The country has the world’s

highest number of startups per capita and over the past five years the

innovation ecosystem has seen a rise in ConTech and PropTech solutions. The

report highlights the Israeli ecosystem maps the noteworthy solutions and

identifies industry trends in ConTech and PropTech.

The first section focuses on major developments in the real

estate and construction industries as well as industry characteristics that

have impacted and driven the need for technology integration over recent years.

From there the report reflects on the technology trends shaping the future of

these industries and examines the main areas for innovation and technological

development in the ConTech and PropTech spaces. Lastly the report covers the

main factors that have brought Israel to become a ConTech and PropTech leader.

Disruptive technologies in the real estate and construction industries will

only become more prominent in the future and this report is a comprehensive

Brian “Flip” Earley 57 of Bloomington passed away peacefully on January 13th.

Brian was the favorite child born to Rex and Bonnie (Beavers) Earley at Schneck Memorial in Seymour on January 21st 1964. Growing up in the Gaiser Park neighborhood in Seymour there were kids everywhere. Being the youngest of 5 was the best. After graduating from Seymour High School (Class of 82) he attended Purdue University where he met the love of his life and the luckiest woman in the world Mary Martin. After graduating from the best school in the state of Indiana Purdue University he and Mary were wedded on November 4th 1989 in Wheaton IL. He worked as Sales Professional for The Sherwin-Williams Company for 32 years before enjoying his retirement on Lake Monroe. Brian was a connoisseur of bourbon and the most effective influencer of a good time no matter the setting.

Brian is preceded in death by both parents (Rex and Bonnie Earley).

Brian is survived by his spouse Mary Earley brothers Dave (Rhonda) Earley Joe (Susan) Earley sisters Rexanne (Jim) Ude Sara (Mark) Clark 10 nieces and 7 nephews.

It seems the combination of seasonal weather enhanced restrictions and COVID impacting health concerns will force an indoor/outdoor celebration which is not likely to occur until springtime.

All that time at home gave way to some seriously stylish and multifunctional interiors as the winners of our sixth annual Top Denver Design contest prove. Read on for six design-savvy residential spaces and a whole home worthy of a standing ovation.

Den

What was once a catchall space that lacked coherent design and function has been transformed into this modern slightly cheeky version of a den you’d find in an English manor house. “We didn’t want this to be typical of anything else in the house which is fresh and light” says designer Miranda Cullen principal of Duet Design Group. “This room is really a destination kind of set apart stylistically from the other spaces.”

Inspired by the client’s childhood in England Cullen and her team created a moody space anchored by a custom built-in complete with an Avocatus fireplace surround. Dentil molding and beefy door-knocker hardware on the pull-down desks flanking the fireplace provide a European flair. The dark paint that extends across the ceiling (crowned with a textural chandelier) “gives the room such a cozy feel” Cullen says pointing out that the palette works because a giant window brings in abundant light.

Even better the design combines tradition with a little sass. For example the artwork over the fireplace (by Washington D.C.–based artist Josh Young) looks like a typical old-world portrait—except that the artist added a dash of paint across the subject’s eyes. The whitewashed hoof legs on the leather ottomans are another playful addition. “Design is personal” Cullen says. “This family doesn’t take itself too seriously and we wanted the den to feel like a reflection of them.” No doubt they’re chuffed to bits by the result.

Dining Room

“Nobody uses a traditional dining room anymore” says designer Andrea Schumacher who skipped the formality and bestowed multifunctional good looks upon this space in the House Beautiful show home in Frederick. “You can host dinner here but you can also pull down a book and have a cup of coffee or use [the room] as a bar.”

Without a client to offer opinions the designer took inspiration from the home’s small-town surroundings (“lots of tumbleweeds and gorgeous 180-degree views of the mountains” she summarizes) and the room itself: The modest footprint and tall ceiling led her to paint the entire space a single striking hue—Sherwin-Williams’ Cascades in high gloss—and accent the upper reaches in a custom wallcovering. “I used every single inch of the walls” she says noting the sky-high built-in shelves (accessed by a sleek ladder). The integrated bar underneath the shelves comprises a vintage dresser topped with Caesarstone quartz.

To fill the lofty ceiling volume Schumacher chose a multitude of Visual Comfort chandeliers from Circa Lighting that are “representative of the tumbleweeds outside” she says. (Kudos to the electrician who had to put 1400 brass petals into the fixtures before hanging them!) Metal Craft a local maker created the dining table’s base from a tree root which was bleached then paired with a custom copper tabletop. Vintage chairs warmed up with sheepskins for a Colorado vibe finish the look—a triumph of modern Centennial State–inspired style.

Home Office

In an era of endless Zoom meetings and on-again off-again virtual schooling a spacious home office might be as coveted as a luxury kitchen. And this walnut-paneled beauty in Broomfield—with a handsome workspace a steel spiral staircase leading to a loft library and glass doors that open to a patio for outdoor meetings—is the stuff of quarantine dreams. The office is part of a 9000-square-foot residence (designed 15 years ago by Denver architects Brad Tomecek and Christopher Herr) that recently underwent a renovation by Boulder’s Rodwin Architecture and Kimball Modern Design and Interiors.

“We rearranged the layout and added contemporary finishes to redefine the very soul of the home” says architect Scott Rodwin. But before the renovation even started the designers and homeowners agreed: The bones of the original old world–inspired library would remain intact. “We decided to keep the existing wood paneling because of its craftsmanship—despite it not being some-thing the homeowners would have chosen themselves” says interior designer Kate Van Sluyter principal at Kimball Modern Design and Interiors who tackled the task of complementing the paneling with a mix of clean-lined office furniture from Blu Dot Design Within Reach and Room & Board. “In this case the traditional styling balanced beautifully with the much more modern style that the owners wanted.” To a home office that looks this good we say: Work from home forever!

Exterior

Incredible views of the Flatirons and downtown Boulder were lost on this South Boulder property’s original home whose architecture did little to capitalize on the stellar hillside site. So the owners called in Chris Gray and Steve Perce of architecture firm Bldg Collective to redesign the structure and maximize the views. The team preserved the old home’s foundation “but even that wasn’t ideally located so with some structural gymnastics we cantilevered the main floor at an angle to better accommodate the connection between the interiors and the outdoors” Gray says. One outcome of their work is this striking outdoor deck (built along with the rest of the home by local contractor Buildwell).

Accessed from the dining room through large sliding doors the area is made of batu hardwood decking and topped by a slatted pergola “so we didn’t limit the amount of natural light [coming] into the home” Gray says. Limestone steel stucco and fire-treated clear vertical grain cedar complete the materials palette which is both contemporary and warm and aligns beautifully with the landscape design by Hidelly Kane of Kane Hanson Architects. The architectural feat here is that “we gave [the owners] intimate space without the sense that they’re in a fishbowl” Gray says. The east-facing deck makes the most of the views and the natural topography—which is steep on this side of the lot—and showcases how to marry form and function to maximum effect.

Kitchen

Those of us of a certain age might cringe to classify anything built in the 1990s as vintage but 30 years of home-decor evolution can’t be denied. Back then kitchens were often small isolated spaces while voluminous dining rooms with oversize tables and chandeliers were the fashion. This Snowmass Village retreat—with its secluded kitchen colossal dining room and timber and moss-rock accents—once epitomized ’90s design. So when architect Flynn Stewart-Severy principal of Snowmass Village’s F&M Architects was hired to reimagine the house for today his first instinct was to convert the dust-collecting dining room into a functional and eye-catching kitchen/great-room core.

“This home was built before kitchens were celebrated public spaces” Stewart-Severy says. “The hierarchy of rooms has evolved and we felt it made sense to reevaluate the layout and push the kitchen forward connecting it to the living room.” Clean white walls and bleached walnut floors replace the original mountain-lodge finishes and dark trim and cabinets (painted Sherwin-Williams’ Sealskin) offer an elegant contrast. Atlanta-based interior designer Jason Mitchell’s selects—including a waterfall-edge Brazilian marble island Francois & Co. brass-trimmed hood and shimmering. Restoration Hardware chandelier—add a bit of glam that feels right at home in the mountains creating a house that honors how its owners live now and for the next 30 years.

Living Room

When it comes to just-right houses this contemporary stunner in the Polo Club neighborhood would get Goldilocks’ seal of approval. Credit that to the homeowners a couple who love to entertain and know exactly how they want a house to function—and who at the first meeting with their architecture team at Semple Brown Design laid out sugar packets on the table to represent their ideal floorplan.

For the home’s centerpiece a sunken living room with 32-foot-wide sliding glass doors that open to a patio and pool the goal was gathering: “They wanted it to function like a boutique hotel with multiple seating areas some more intimate than others” says interior designer Danielle Wallinger principal of Studio D Interior Design. A tufted two-sided custom sectional sofa (which the designer describes as “Harvey Probber–meets–Minotti”) was “designed to offer different configurations throughout the year depending on the season or the occasion” Wallinger says.

A grand piano in one corner of the room and a built-in bar with a hidden television in the other take the space from game-day hub to holiday sing-along headquarters in an instant. And overhead a trio of Gallotti & Radice’s Bolle Orizzontale chandeliers adds some fairytale magic. Just like Goldilocks we’d like to stay awhile.

The 55-year-old Great British Bake Off judge wowed Instagram followers on Saturday with a throwback shot of himself during his younger days.

Sporting a white T-shirt and a chain around his neck a youthful Hollywood flashes a big grin for the camera. Noticeably absent are his signature silver locks and trademark facial hair that fans of the celebrity baker have grown accustomed to on GBBO.

""Brother has just sent me this from 92/93 I think no beard !! 😂"" he captioned the snap.

Fans were also quick to point out the younger Hollywood's resemblance to the Baldwin brothers (Alec Daniel William and Stephen) in the comments section.

One fan wrote ""A look of the Baldwin brothers 🔥??"" while another asked ""You sure that's not a young Baldwin brother?! 😂"" ""Lies that's a missing Baldwin brother!"" another follower joked.

Hollywood remains the show's sole castmember to appear in all 12 seasons across multiple networks. He currently judges opposite Prue Leith who replaced Dame Mary Berry in 2017.

Great British Bake Off's Paul Hollywood has left fans swooning and wondering if he's a Baldwin brother in a youthful throwback picture from the 1990s.

The celebrity chef who rose in popularity judging on the Channel 4 baking show took to Instagram to share a snap his brother had sent him from his younger years.

In the picture Paul can be seen beaming off camera with a bare face and dark hair - a stark contrast to his iconic white hair and beard that he's known for sporting now.

The younger Paul dons a metal chain and a white top with purple trimming around the collar but his 503k Instagram followers were delighted with the image.

He captioned the snap: ""Brother has just sent me this from 92/93 I think no beard !! [laughing emoji]"".

One fan said: ""You look like William Baldwin"".

Another penned: ""Definitely a secret Baldwin. @alecbaldwininsta come get your half brother or whatever this one is.""

One said: ""So handsome Paul!! Then and now! You've aged like a fine wine!""

A second penned: ""Very cute but he actually gets better with age.""

While a third said: ""You could cut glass with that jawline!""

The star baker made headlines that month when he took on a late night shift at his girlfriend's pub in Kent.

Paul was snapped serving up pizzas at his girlfriend Melissa Spalding's restaurant and bar.

He wore his traditional chef whites - with his name clearly scrawled across his chest - as he offered a helping hand at The Chequers Inn.

Although he's worth a whopping £11.5 million he is clearly still willing to pitch in with hard work during busy services.

His relationship with Melissa is his second public relationship since his split from ex-wife Alexandra in 2017.

SunSpear Games recently received a grant from Epic Games towards its PC and console-based game Immortal: Gates of Pyre.

“The team wanted to find a place to co-locate and build a company so we all decided on the Rogue Valley area and moved up here around two and half years ago” said SunSpear Games CEO Kevin Wagner. The grant comes 6 months after applying to the Epic Games Mega Grants Program.

Wagner says the company had to send in a video of the game so Epic Games could assess its potential.

The 2-v-2 game is currently in its alpha phase meaning only a certain amount of people are able to play at this time.

“We’ll have beta probably in about a year or so 12-15 months at that point we’ll open it up to a much larger crowd a lot more people can play it we’ll start monetizing the game – we’ll do a full launch about a year after that which is where we add a lot of content and think it’s much more ready for the world at that point.”

Wagner says it’s been in development since around 2019.

The Immortal world in the game is intended to be the size of a DC universe.

“What they told us [Epic Games] is that they saw something very unique very interesting because we’re trying to build a game that’s different from other games out there right now. It’s a unique angle on strategy gaming” he said.

Wagner says the grant money will help with expanding the company as well as making improvements on content and the game world.

“Right now we’re 36 people and we intend to have 85 people in the company with a good portion here in the Rogue Valley. We love this place we want to make it our home we want to fit into the community very well and very respectfully” said Wagner.

The game is expected to expand with new content over the next decade.

Live performances:Eclipse Theatre Company unveils roster of 'thought-provoking' comedies for 2022 season

Notaro 50 spoke in advance of appearing Jan. 16 at the Southern Theatre.

Question: How did you get your nickname?

Notaro: My brother made it up when I was 2. He couldn’t say my real name Mathilde. I always tell people Tig’s long for ‘T.”

Evolution of a comic

Q: You’re known for deadpan comedy. How did that develop?

Notaro: It must have evolved at some point but as long as I can remember people have told me my comedy was so dry.... It sounded like a compliment so it was thrilling. There’s a bit of a sneak surprise when you deliver your punchline.

Q: How has your standup evolved?

Notaro: It was mainly observational over the years. I think I just allowed myself to change. I’ve wanted to grow and tell longer stories more than just a short joke or one-liner. I even do some physical bits and then tell personal stories. I tried over the years to not tell myself: ""No you can’t do this."" Sometimes when you do that you get stuck and it’s not fun anymore.

Q: Did growing up a tomboy shape your perspective?

Notaro: I always felt empowered by who and what I was. ... I felt being a woman was a strength. Once I figured out I was gay that was a strength. ... all the different thoughts and ideas I got from life with my own lens.

How Tig Notaro's art imitates life

Q: You’ve been married to Stephanie Allynne since 2015 and welcomed twin sons in 2016. Do you often bring your family into your act?

Notaro: I bring a good amount of material from my real life for sure. I always tell people I live with a writing staff because just waking up every day it’s endless stories and experiences.

I try to keep some stuff under wraps and find a happy medium. I try to remember my sons are still young and aren’t able to make choices about what’s shared about their lives. But it’s hard to let a good story go. ... I might run it by Stephanie: ""Hey do you mind if I tell that story when that thing happened with the cat?""

Q: Did sharing your life in “Tig” “One Mississippi” and elsewhere have an impact on you and fans?

Notaro: I couldn’t believe how good it felt to share. ... to experience that connection with so many. Everybody can relate one way or another. ... A lot of my stuff is still very observational entwined with personal things. It’s not something I would have done years ago but when life took me down I couldn’t help explore that.

Q: Did the pandemic change your standup focus?

Notaro: No. It’s pretty much a lot of family talk jokes stories and every now and then a story about my health not cancer-related. I’ve had other struggles over the past nine years and I’m doing well.

Laughing through pain of cancer

Q: You got a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with cancer in 2012. How did your sense of humor help you through?

Notaro: I’ve always gone toward awkward uncomfortable with a sense of humor and that was more than awkward or uncomfortable. It was hard. I’m just really thankful I can have that ability to break the tension of the moment with comedy.

Q: What did you learn from your brush with mortality?

Notaro: I often think how quickly everything can just slip away... whether it’s my health or a relationship that’s struggling or anything. Aside from cancer I also lost my mother had a digestive disease and went through a breakup in a four-month period. It’s really not some deep lesson but it feels like you’re standing on an edge a cliff or hill and the sand beneath you starts to go. ... sometimes it just keeps going.

Movie mania

Q: You appeared in Zack Snyder’s 2021 zombie heist thriller “Army of the Dead” but performed your supporting role digitally after regular shooting. How was that experience? And do you enjoy making movies?

Notaro: Obviously that was a very weird situation but I had such a great time with Zack and his crew. ... My wife and I write and produce and I’ve done several (upcoming) movies in the past year: a romantic comedy (Netflix’s “Your Place or Mine”) with Ashton Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon; a family ghost movie (Netflix’s “We Have a Ghost”) set in New Orleans; and my wife and I co-directed a film (“Am I OK?”) with Dakota Johnson. Zack and I are talking about doing something else together.

Bigger and better

Q: What was your first big break?

Notaro: Every step of the way has been a big break. My first big break — and I mean this genuinely — was just getting onstage to do my first open-mic set. I felt that was the biggest moment of my career. It’s always gotten to be bigger and bigger and bigger.

Q: You’ve reached 50. How does that feel?

Notaro: Oh my God ... I never really had an age I hit when I felt it was the big one or a big deal. I still always kind of feel 25 in my head but I’m OK with being 50. I’ve hit my stride and feel better than ever. The wisdom and experiences I have at this age feel really good and earned.

The ethical food retailer is using Hikvision's live facial recognition technology to monitor customers.

Hikvision cameras have been listed as a national security threat in the US while the UK's Ministry of Defence has issued guidance not to use the company's equipment.

And the firm has been blacklisted by US authorities over links to human rights abuses against Muslim Uighurs in China while MPs have called for a UK-wide ban.

But at Southern Co-op bosses have rolled out facial recognition technology across 35 stores in the south of England.

Co-op are set to use facial recognition cameras made by Chinese state-owned company Hikvision in 35 supermarkets across south England. Pictured: Co-op store in central London

An investigation by video surveillance researchers at IPVM and passed to the Mail on Sunday found that all nine stores out of the 35 it investigated used Hikvision facial recognition devices.

Live facial recognition is used by Co-op at stores in Southampton Portsmouth West London Bristol and Chichester.

The supermarket's system is provided by Facewatch a live facial recognition company which says it helps retailers catch shoplifters and violent customers.

Facewatch says it keeps a database of the faces of 'subjects of interest' for two years though facial recognition technology is known to return large numbers of false matches.

The company also claims unmatched faces are 'deleted instantly'.

Fraser Sampson the Government's independent Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner for England and Wales warned of the importance of 'ethical leadership' in relation to facial recognition technology.

He said: 'I was asked to do an interview with Facewatch this week in which I addressed the importance of ethical practice – individual and corporate – if we are to retain public trust and confidence in the legitimate use of facial recognition generally.

Hikvision cameras (one is pictured) have been listed as a national security threat in the US while the UK's Ministry of Defence has issued guidance not to use the company's equipment

'I also spoke about the importance of ethical leadership in this area which I believe involves not only responding to challenge but actively inviting it.

'I have publicly raised a number of pertinent questions with Hikvision several months ago.

'So far their answer has said very little but their response tells people a lot'.

Authorities in the US fear the companies' camera technology present a national security concern because of their Chinese state ownership which the firms' bosses strongly deny.

Hikvision's cameras have been also widely used in the repression of the Muslim minority Uighurs in China including inside internment camps.

Conservative MP Alicia Kearns of the China Research Group said: 'I understand that high-tech security cameras are important for shops like Co-Op.

'Using cameras from a company like Hikvision isn't the answer. A company complicit in the genocide of the Uyghur and surveiling the concentration camps in Xinjiang.

'The Co-Op must rip this technology from their shops or risk giving the Chinese Government a map of each and every one of our faces endangering us all.'

The MoS has also uncovered that police forces are using Chinese state-made cameras to track vehicles on the roads.

Hikvision's cameras have been widely used in the repression of the Muslim minority Uighurs in China including inside internment camps. Pictured: Hikvision face-recognition camera

Staffordshire Leicestershire and West Midlands Police all use Hikvision cameras for their automatic number plate recognition technology leading to security concerns while others use the firm's CCTV equipment.

A Southern Co-op spokeswoman said: 'No facial images from the Southern Co-op platform are shared with any other organisation.

'Our limited and targeted use of this technology is only where there is a high level of crime and is used to protect our store colleagues from assaults and violence.

'Our process uses a combination of facial recognition technology and human verification. If a facial image match takes place upon store entry these are flagged as an alert to the store or duty manager and then validated by a colleague in store.'

A Hikvision spokesman said: 'Hikvision is committed to upholding the right to privacy and protecting people and their property.

'The UK Government recently rejected a call for Hikvision to be banned from the United Kingdom. We remain resolute in our mission to enhance safety for all.'"

Those storms in turn led the U.S. airlines to cancel thousands of flights leaving passengers scrambling.

One of those passengers was me. Here's how I handled one cancellation avoided another and ended up with hundreds of dollars in Southwest flight vouchers as a result.

Rescheduling a canceled Southwest flight

I was scheduled to take a nonstop flight on Southwest Airlines on Tuesday Jan. 5 from San Antonio to Baltimore. I checked the flight status before I left home but by the time I arrived at San Antonio International Airport (SAT) the flight was canceled.

There was a long line at the gate for re-accommodation but thanks to my Southwest A-List status I could skip the queue and call the dedicated line to reschedule. (I first checked the app but it didn't have any good options for me.) After a 49-minute wait I was not better off than when I started; the agent wasn't able to find me a flight until the evening of Friday Jan. 8 which was a no-go.

Related: Why I'm scrambling to make Southwest A-List status

Giving up on Southwest I went on the Delta app to see if it had any flights to Baltimore on Tuesday Jan. 5 my original departure day. I found one but by the time I hit the payment page that seat was gone. A second search showed no availability until Thursday Jan. 7 which did not work for my timeline.

I ended up buying a United Airlines fare for a morning flight via George Bush Intercontinental (IAH) on Wednesday Jan. 6 which was the earliest I could get. I paid $502 one way almost double what I initially paid on Southwest for the first leg of my trip. Southwest automatically refunded the $254.79 SAT-BWI part of my fare.

Surprise vouchers

After I arrived in Baltimore on Jan. 6 I called the A-List line to make sure my Saturday return to San Antonio wasn't canceled as well. The agent was very apologetic about the cancellation and I assured him I knew it was a weather issue. He replied that it wasn't good enough and the next thing I know I had a $300 LUV voucher for the inconvenience. Sweet!

This was amazing for two reasons. One I hadn't asked for any compensation. Two it was a weather-related cancelation and the airline's own contract of carriage states that:

""In the event Carrier cancels or fails to operate any flight according to Carrier's published schedule or changes the schedule of any flight Carrier will at the request of a Passenger with a confirmed Ticket on such flight take one of the following actions: Transport the Passenger at no additional charge on Carrier's next flight(s) on which space is available to the Passenger's intended destination in accordance with Carrier's established re-accommodation practices; or

refund the unused portion of the Passenger's fare in accordance with Section 4c.""

Southwest had fulfilled its commitment to me by refunding me the cost of the unused ticket. It had no obligation to offer me an additional voucher.

I continued to live my happy life in Baltimore closing down my apartment and running errands on Jan. 6-7. Then on Friday morning Jan. 8 I was alerted to another slew of airline cancelations through the weekend by Ethan Klapper TPG's new senior aviation reporter. This was not welcome news because I had a flight home scheduled for Saturday Jan. 9.

Sure enough when I checked the Southwest Airlines app I found a winter weather warning and an offer to reschedule my Jan. 9 flight for free. I decided to be proactive and took the carrier up on the offer booking a nonstop flight to San Antonio early on Sunday Jan. 10. I booked another night at the Hyatt Place hotel that had been my home for the week and spent the evening binge-watching episodes of ""The Love Boat"" (don't judge me) on Paramount+.

As I was relaxing I checked my email and -- surprise -- Southwest had sent me another voucher this time for $250 for the Saturday flight I rebooked. Together the two vouchers totaled $550 and were very welcomed especially since the airline was under no obligation to offer them.

Tips for handling flight cancellations and rebooking

Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation here are some tips to make the rebooking process a little less stressful.

First make sure to download your airline's app which can be invaluable if you need to rebook your flight. If your flight gets canceled or if the airline is apprehensive about winter weather and is encouraging travelers to make itinerary changes in advance the app will not only alert you but also suggest flight alternatives you can book right on your phone.

If you hear about bad weather start checking the app the day before your flight which will give you more time to rearrange your plans and let you rebook before everyone else does when more flights have open seats. You will not be charged a change fee if the airline is asking you to rebook a flight that's likely to be disrupted by weather.

Should the airline proactively offer to reschedule your flight say yes if you can make the new flight fit your schedule. You're much more likely to be accommodated if that rebooked flight gets canceled because the airline knows you changed your plans on their advice and will give you priority in getting you where you need to go.

In situations where your original or rescheduled flight is canceled do not stand in line at the check-in counter. Again check the app to see if the airline has proactively rescheduled your flight.

If they have but the times don't work call the airline -- and be ready to wait. If you have elite status call the dedicated phone line.

As you're holding get on a website or app such as Kayak or Orbitz to find flights on other airlines so you have a Plan B.

The more initiative you can take the better chance you have of making it to your final destination in a reasonable timeframe. You might not always luck out with additional travel vouchers as I did but after all your trip delay bad luck you might be rewarded with an unexpected surprise.

With the U.S. Supreme Court blocking the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for private companies employers now face a patchwork of state rules on COVID-19 workplace safety.

Different and sometimes confusing vaccine rules now apply across the economy based on the city sector funding source and corporate policy.

“There isn’t a right answer for employers at this point” said Shannon Farmer an attorney at Ballard Spahr in Philadelphia.

She said the U.S. Supreme Court’s action on Thursday to freeze the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s vaccine-or-test mandates could pit a company’s human relations staffers who want to protect the health of employees against operating executives who worry how internal vaccine mandates could cause employees to quit.

John S. Ho co-chair of OSHA-Workplace Safety Practice at Cozen O’Connor said that companies can “essentially ignore” the Biden vaccine mandate though the issue will be litigated in the lower federal courts. “It’s not over yet but employers don’t have to worry about it. So folks are left with different state and city rules.”

On Friday Mayor Jim Kenney’s administration set a Jan. 24 date for implementing a vaccination mandate for city workers after reaching a deal with one of the city’s unions. The city has 22000 unionized employees and they will be required to show proof of vaccination or obtain an exemption for religious or medical reasons.

Some Philly-area employers such as Amtrak and WSFS Bank the largest bank based in the Philadelphia area had already implemented vaccine-or-testing rules similar to the OSHA standard that the court has now suspended.

National employers including American Express BlackRock General Electric Google MGM International Comcast’s NBC Universal and Southwest Airlines are requiring vaccines for workers at their locations according to a list compiled by NBC News.

CVS and McDonald’s are requiring higher-paid office and professional staff but not hourly-paid retail workers to get the shots.

American Airlines one of the largest private employers in Philadelphia said on Friday that it was subject to a totally different mandate one for federal contractors.

“We shared last week that more than 96% of our team members have submitted proof of vaccination or a request for an accommodation. This is great news and we continue to see submissions every day” a spokesperson said in an email on Friday.

But Farmer the Ballard Spahr attorney said that in a separate and earlier decision the courts had stayed or frozen the mandates for federal contractors as it did on Thursday for the OSHA vaccine mandate.

The Supreme Court’s ruling

In its ruling the Supreme Court said that the Biden administration and OSHA had exceeded their authority in an attempt “to regulate public health more broadly” than Congress had authorized.

The justices however let stand a separate vaccine mandate covering 10 million health-care workers who treat patients in the federally funded Medicare and Medicaid programs.

The vote in the vaccine mandate case was 6 to 3 with the liberal justices in opposition. The health care case split was 5 to 4 with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh joining the liberal justices.

The court majority explained the distinction it drew this way: COVID–19 is not an occupational hazard as it spreads at home in schools at sports games and where people get together. As such OSHA the federal workplace safety agency is not authorized under federal law to protect broadly against it.

But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has a responsibility to protect the patients at facilities funded by federal health dollars and can enact regulations to ensure patient safety such as vaccinations for nurses and doctors against COVID-19.

“The key issue in both cases was neither whether vaccine mandates are beneficial nor whether people have a right to refuse them. Rather the issue was whether Congress had given the agencies the power to impose the mandates” said Michael R. Dimino law professor at Widener University Commonwealth Law School.

Business lobbyists had complained about the cost of the measure which would affect over 80 million workers including 1.8 million in the Philly area at firms employing 100 or more workers.

In applauding the decision Leslie Sarasin president of the Food Marketing Institute one of 10 employer groups that sued to block the requirement said that the food sector would find itself grappling with an even more acute worker shortage on top of the other economic distortions brought on by the health crisis.

The high court “recognized the challenges the federal rule would have imposed on food retailers and manufacturers our employees and ultimately American consumers” Sarasin said.

Suspending federal enforcement “will help ensure the food industry is able to continue meeting our customers’ needs as efficiently and effectively as possible amid the ongoing supply chain and labor disruptions” Sarasin added in a statement.

A local labor leader disagreed. “It would have been really good if the [OSHA policy] had been put into effect with everybody following the same standard” said Wendell Young IV head of UFCW Local 1776 which represents 35000 supermarket pharmacy and food factory workers in Pennsylvania and a few neighboring areas.

The OSHA requirement set a national standard that took pressure off individual employers to do the right thing even when it was unpopular he added.

Young said some big employers have been planning in the absence of a federal rule to step up vaccination and testing requirements and to pay sick employees to stay home under quarantine rather than risk sickening more workers.

He cited Tyson Foods and JBS the meatpacking giant among the large employers who had agreed to encourage vaccination and testing even before the Biden policy was announced last year.

Young said 90% of workers at the JBS plant in Souderton were vaccinated after the death of a union shop steward Enock Benjamin early in the pandemic — a higher level than in surrounding affluent Montgomery County.

“In the more rural areas some employees aren’t taking it as seriously as well as some of our members” Young admitted. “But they are taking it seriously where they see the impact on management’s ability to run the plant” as sick workers called out. Young said management at the Cargill and Hershey plants in Hazle Township Luzerne County among others are negotiating tougher anti-virus rules.

The largest U.S. employer affected by the ruling Amazon had no immediate comment on the decision or its impact.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvc3RhbmxleS1ibGFjay0tZGVja2VyLXJlcG9ydHMtMXEtMjAyNC1yZXN1bHRzLTMwMjEzMzgyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Black & Decker Reports 1Q 2024 Results,"First Quarter Gross Margin Expanded Versus Prior Year Driven by Lower Inventory Destocking Costs Supply Chain Transformation Benefits and Reduced Shipping Costs

Global Cost Reduction Program Supporting Gross Margin Expansion

The Company continued executing a series of initiatives that are expected to generate $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate cost savings by the end of 2024 growing to $2 billion by the end of 2025. Of the $2 billion savings $1.5 billion is expected to be delivered through a supply chain transformation that leverages strategic sourcing drives operational excellence consolidates facilities and optimizes the distribution network and reduces complexity of the product portfolio.

These actions are expected to return adjusted gross margins* to historical 35%+ levels. Additionally the Global Cost Reduction Program is expected to optimize the Company's cost base to fund investments that accelerate growth in core businesses.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

The siren-embellished coffee giant warned customers Friday that their next visit “may look different” as omicron case counts spike and more workers call in sick. That can mean reduced hours a lack of certain products or a temporary halt on mobile orders and mobile pay at certain stores.

“As we have since the beginning of the pandemic local leaders can and do scale operations based on partner availability and local COVID-19 factors” Starbucks said in a statement to USA TODAY. “These decisions are made on a store-by-store and market-by-market basis.”

The company said it would postpone reward members’ star expirations through April 1 as it worked to ""quickly"" resolve the disruptions “in these trying times.”

“You have our commitment to make the situation right” a Friday email to Starbucks customers reads. “We will always make proactive decisions that prioritize the health and well-being of our customers and our partners.”

Starbucks suggests checking out its app to find the latest product availability before placing an order. The app and its website will also show each store's current operating hours.

Staff shortages have been hitting a bevy of industries amid the latest COVID-19 surge. Airlines have had to cancel flights in recent weeks due to a high number of employee sick calls and hospital staffers have been calling out sick in record numbers.

We'd venture to guess that many people at some point in their lives have been involved in some type of pay-it-forward chain in the drive-through line. You're just pulling through your preferred coffee chain's line-up trying to get your morning caffeine boost when the employee at the window informs you that the car in front of you has already paid for your order — so you make the decision to do the same for the car behind you and so on. It seems like a positive thing to do but one thread on the Starbucks subreddit suggests you should consider switching up your definition of paying it forward and supporting someone other than the other customers around you (via Reddit).

The protesters were calling for an end to Starbucks' upcharge on certain milk options.

The animal rights group is speaking out against the coffee chain charging extra for plant-based milks such as oat almond and soy.



The group handed out free oat milk cold brew to customers coming to place an order.



The action comes after PETA asked Starbucks to end its vegan upcharge as PETA advocates for more people to choose a vegan lifestyle.





“Switching your diet to a plant-based diet is the number one thing that you can do to help out the planet prevent animal cruelty and take care of your body"" said Calen Otto a PETA supporter. ""So we’re hoping that people can ditch dairy and live a vegan plant-based lifestyle.”

PETA has held similar protests outside Starbucks locations in other cities like Cincinnati and Omaha."

Stretched thin even before the pandemic an exhausted roster of nurses and hospital staff continue to care for an ever-booming caseload. St. Michael's 55-bed emergency department saw 249 people on a single day Jan. 3 a record far exceeding its average of 185. As the rapidly spreading omicron COVID-19 variant has sent cases spiking the first week of January saw a pandemic-high 61 COVID-19 hospitalizations in Kitsap.

“If we didn’t have these (travel nurses) I don’t know how we would stay open or how we would take all this influx of patients” said Cindy Franck a staff nurse at the hospital and a union representative for UFCW 21.

The travel nurses – contracted staff brought in through an outside agency – were requested by the hospital last year even before the arrival of omicron which has further strained hospital systems around the world.

St. Michael Medical Center president Chad Melton confirmed to the Kitsap Sun that the hospital requested nursing help through the Kitsap County Department of Emergency Management. Through a state contract with ACI Federal the hospital was granted two nurses in September and 50 in October; eight nurses were requested in November but that request was pending Melton said.

State Secretary of Health Umair Shah said Thursday that 875 of 1210 health care staffers available through the state's contract have already been deployed to hospitals and long-term care facilities throughout that state. Another 200 people were in the process of being deployed leaving 135 employees still available under the contract. Staff used for direct COVID-19 patient care are paid for by pandemic response funds.

Gov. Jay Inslee urged hospitals to take advantage of the available staff: ""We need to get these people treated and we need more staff"" he said. ""They need to step up to the plate and hire these people.""

'Nurses are burned out'

St. Michael Medical Center nurses who spoke to the Kitsap Sun for this story described nursing shortages in the hospital but also staffing issues in jobs like certified nursing assistants and environmental services staff. Their experiences mirror difficulties faced across the country at hospitals which lost an average of 3000 employees per month last year according to federal data.

“Nurses are burned out"" Franck said. ""Our staff before we got all of these travelers have been working 5 6 7 days a week taking multiple shifts every week. The money is good but the burnout is high.”

Franck said the staffing shortage predates the COVID-19 pandemic. “It was kind of like an accident waiting to happen” she said.

Melton said the staffing requests for the traveling nurses were a “direct result of the increase of COVID cases paired with a general increase in hospital visits in some cases driven by patients seeking treatment that were delayed during the pandemic.”

Melton said the hospital is taking several steps to address staffing levels including incentive pay and hiring travel nurses as well as recruiting staff from across the country. He said it's typically more difficult to recruit on the peninsula.

""We have also experienced retirements and resignations from staff members resulting from burnout throughout the pandemic"" he said.

The most acute staffing issues at the hospital have come in the emergency room the family birth center and in critical care areas one nurse who works at the hospital told the Kitsap Sun which granted the employee anonymity because they feared retaliation for speaking publicly.

“We get calls every single day about being short-staffed” the nurse said. “Can you come in today? Can you come in the next day? I don’t know if that’s sustainable in the long run. You need to get more people and the people need to want to be there.”

It can be frustrating for staff to know that travel positions offer much better pay so some will leave for one of those jobs the nurse said. As the pandemic has worn on some have left the industry for good or have retired early.

Another nurse said that prior to the influx of travel nurses staffing was “pretty critical.” That nurse who worked in the hospital's emergency department did not wish to be identified for fear of jeopardizing their career prospects.

“They’re short-staffed so nurses are required to clean rooms take out the trash take out laundry even sweeping and mopping floors in between patients” the second anonymous nurse said. “When you’re turning rooms over every 30 minutes to 3 hours that’s a lot of cleaning that nursing staff is being required to do. That has definitely been a challenge. It’s embarrassing because the rooms don’t look so great and patients come in and have to see a dirty floor.”

Virginia Mason Franciscan Health has done little to provide incentives to retain permanent staff said that nurse who planned to leave a staff job for a travel position pointing to the better pay that such a job would offer.

A short-term fix

A jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this month showed hospital employment was down by about 96000 compared with February 2020 and that hospitals lost an average of 3000 jobs per month in 2021. Overall health care jobs have been pummeled by the pandemic: The country is about 400000 jobs below where it was when it lost 1.6 million positions in March and April 2020.

There’s been a reliance on travel staff across the health care industry to cover hard-to-fill staffing gaps during the pandemic said Sue Skillman senior deputy director of the University of Washington Center for Health Workforce Studies describing those positions as a “short-term fix.”

“Certainly there’s a tendency right now to use (travel staff) among the tools for fixing the problem and keeping the lights on and the doors open” she said.

While using travel staff can help to fill holes there are downsides.

“A lot of hospitals especially are using traveling agencies but there’s mixed feelings” said Ben Stubbs who also works in UW Center for Health Workforce Studies. “There’s this push-pull where they’re seeing their own employees leave for the – in many cases – much higher wages that they can earn and then feeling that they have to then go to those same travel agencies that in many cases they feel have sort of poached their employees to fill those same roles.”

Nursing shortages aren’t all that’s plagued the industry though. There’s been “incredible” problems filling positions at the lower end of the pay scale jobs like nursing assistants and home care workers Skillman said at a time when a job outside the industry might be more attractive.

“Where else are there jobs right now?” she said. “All retail is begging for people all service industry is begging for people. So let's see I'm taking care of elderly people with COVID infections in a nursing home or I can go work at a Fred Meyer or a Walmart or a hotel or something and not be around people for the same amount of money or more because those wages are going up too.”

Skillman described a range of issues that have contributed to the staffing problems the industry now faces. Some who were thinking of retiring decided now was the time to step away. Others have decided to stay home to take care of their families. Some fear exposure to COVID-19 and don’t want to take the risk and others are simply getting sick.

Omicron is another log added to the fire.

“There’s a lot of things going on” Skillman said. “It’s just come together into an across-the-board reduction of available workforce and health care is potentially even more so because of the risks and then the burnout of dealing with all the COVID issues.”

'A constant juggle'

In an interview with the Kitsap Sun Melton president of St. Michael Medical Center since September said he’s impressed with how hospital staff have handled a crushing load. The hospital since its Dec. 20 2020 opening has served more than 138000 patients.

""This team has worked extremely hard"" he said.

Delays at the emergency room where even fire department ambulances have stacked up for hours in the past year is a symptom of the wider problem Melton said. Too many people are ""boarded"" there because they can't access the care they need after arriving at the emergency department. That backs up the entire system.

""It's a constant juggle all day"" he said.

The hospital's 55-bed emergency room has been expanded to include space in the facility's former ER. The hospital can also ""surge"" its capacity using its catheterization laboratory or pre-op surgery departments.

Another struggle Melton pointed to is the limited number of post-acute care beds the state currently has which he said means hospitals are not always able to discharge patients to places like skilled nursing facilities as quickly as they usually might.

There's only one long-term way out: hire and retain a workforce. It's one of Melton's top three goals along with maintaining accreditation and positive hospital evaluations and increasing community outreach.

In his previous job Melton helped start a year-long nurse residency program. He believes in a grassroots approach that trains the doctors and nurses in the communities where they ultimately work and pointed to the local family residency program that minted seven new doctors six of whom have remained in the area practicing. Melton also noted that a new class of 31 nurse residents many of them graduates of Olympic College are soon graduating to help fill the depleted ranks of the hospital. ""One of my fundamental beliefs is it starts with our people"" he said.

To further help Melton urged the community to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and seek a booster shot. He also cautioned community members against driving to the emergency room if their needs are not emergent.

""Despite these challenges we are well-prepared to manage these dynamics and urge the community not to delay care"" Melton said. ""We are carefully monitoring these factors across the hospital system to ensure we provide our patients with the care they need.""

A company spokesperson confirmed that the closure downtown is permanent.

Rick Filippi one of three owners of the building that includes 502 State St. said he thinks the closures are connected to the labor shortage.

The exterior of the Starbucks Coffee 502 State St. in Erie is shown on Wednesday. The store is permanently closed according to the Starbucks corporate office.

""My understanding is that Starbucks is closing a lot of stores some temporarily and some permanently"" Filippi said. ""Unfortunately the Fifth-and-State (streets) location is one of those being closed permanently. My understanding is a lot of this relates to a pandemic-related difficulty of getting employees.""

The company spokesperson would not explain the reason for the closure saying only ""As part of Starbucks standard course of business we continually evaluate our business to ensure a healthy store portfolio"" the statement said. ""After careful consideration we determined it is best to close the (502 State St. store). Our last day at this location was Dec. 27.""

The coffee chain based in Seattle Washington announced in June 2020 that it would close up to 400 company-owned stores over the next 18 months as it rolled out a new format and made other changes.

Employees were given the option to transfer to nearby locations.

There once were seven Starbucks locations in Erie but a store locator Google map on the company's website indicates there are now only four and one of those — at 6801 Peach St. — is listed as ""temporarily closed."" The 502 State St. store and another store once located inside the Millcreek Mall don't appear on the map at all.

According to the map the remaining open locations include one inside Barnes & Noble at 5909 Peach St.; one inside Target 6700 Peach St.; another at 350 Millcreek Square (near Interchange Road); and the fourth at 2205 W. 12th St. in Millcreek Township.

Filippi said he noticed the State Street store had been limiting its hours for a while.

""In the last few months they've been closing at 2 in the afternoon"" Filippi said. ""All I know is we had recently signed a lease about two years ago so I don't know how that's going to play out. That's all I know right now.""

While the city has for years been replacing lead pipes in the public right-of-way as it rebuilds streets 20 to 25% of its residential customers still may have harmful lead that is leaching into their home's water supply.

Those numbers presented at a recent Board of Water Commissioners meeting were alarming enough that commission members called for an aggressive 10-year plan to replace all lead pipes on public or private property. The estimated total cost is more than $220 million water officials said.

Chris Tolbert a water commissioner and City Council member said the work to get the lead out should not wait.

""I think we need to be bold on this. We need to say we are going to replace every lead pipe in the next 10 years — public and private — and push it"" Tolbert said calling for a comprehensive plan to be presented at next month's water board meeting. ""It's the right thing to do and pretty simple: Pull the lead pipe and put the copper in.""

The estimated cost to replace all right-of-way lead pipes is $82 million. The estimated cost to homeowners to replace the private property side of those lines is $141 million.

Although the price tag is daunting Tolbert and Amy Brendmoen a fellow commissioner and City Council president said St. Paul should tap into an expected windfall of federal dollars — from the American Rescue Plan and the infrastructure bill which includes money specifically for replacing lead service lines to make it happen.

""If I have learned one thing in my time in elective office it's that if you have a plan in place when money comes up you can catch it and put it to good use"" Brendmoen said.

Still even with the influx of federal funds paying the full cost of replacing St. Paul's lead water pipes may require state assistance — in the form of bonding — as well as assessments and raising customers' water rates.

""As a utility from the board down to a staffing level we do have the will to get it done as quickly as we can"" said Patrick Shea St. Paul Regional Water Services general manager.

The plan Shea expects to present at the Feb. 8 water board meeting will contain budget assumptions as well as projected shortfalls he said.

After a federal law passed in the 1990s required the utility to come up with a replacement schedule Shea said St. Paul was required to test water from 200 properties submitting results from 30 of the worst cases every three years.

So far lead levels have been below the government's ""trigger level"" of 15 parts per billion Shea said. But a new rule that will take effect in October 2024 will require cities to replace lead water lines more swiftly if lead levels reach 10 parts per billion he said. No amount of lead in water is desirable Shea said and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could force St. Paul's hand.

Lead service lines were installed in St. Paul and some nearby suburbs through the late 1920s although some went in as late as the 1940s. The city has set up a map that allows property owners to look up their homes to see if they have lead water pipes. Those concerned about lead in their water can obtain a free test kit from St. Paul Regional Water Services at 1900 Rice St. Shea said.

The city owns the pipe that runs from the water main beneath the street up to the edge of private property and is responsible for the cost of replacing it. Homeowners must pay to replace water pipe that runs from the edge of their property into their home.

For 25 years St. Paul Regional Water Services has been replacing lead water pipes in the street right-of-way usually at the same time as street and water main reconstruction projects.

While the city has been replacing about 400 lead water lines a year in the right-of-way only 5-10% of property owners have opted to replace the lead pipes going into their house at the same time. To coax more homeowners to do the work — estimated at $6000 — the city offers an assessment program allowing them to pay through their property taxes over 20 years.

In 2021 the state added $1500 grants to property owners — $2500 for low-income applicants and registered childcare providers — to offset the cost. While replacement numbers rose officials say few low-income residents and childcare providers have taken advantage.

Nearly 9000 properties in St. Paul still have full lead water service lines under both the right-of-way and on private property. Another 11200 homes have had their right-of-way pipes replaced with copper but still have lead going into their homes. There are 6500 homes where officials don't know what the water pipes are made of but say they may contain lead.

The current system of voluntary replacement and financial incentives isn't cutting it Tolbert said. Public health and safety demand swifter action he insisted.

""Replacing these lead pipes is going to be mandated by either the state or the federal governments"" he said. ""We should go above and beyond and do that now.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXVndXN0aW5lLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAxLzE2L2dhbGxlcnktY2l2aWwtcmlnaHRzLXByb3Rlc3QtMTk2NC82NTM5NDkzMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gallery: Civil Rights protest in 1964,"NEWS

Correction: A message sent to Teslarati has confirmed that Steel Dynamics Inc. is not Tesla’s supplier for the Cybertruck’s steel. With regards to the Cybertruck’s supply chain Steel Dynamics will aspire to work towards becoming an approved supplier to Tesla.

***Original article follows***

Steel Dynamics Inc. (SDI) Tesla’s steel supplier for the Cybertruck’s exoskeleton is expected to start initial operations in its Sinton Texas facility next month. The update was shared to local media by Dennis Black the General Manager of SDI’s Sinton site.

The Sinton site is a 1.2-million-square-foot facility that is packed with innovative technologies. The steel that would be produced in the Sinton site would be quite environmentally-friendly as well. As noted in a report from 3News the steel mill features machines that could turn scrap metal into rolled steel that could be used for various commercial purposes.

Black explained that the facility would be using about 90% scrap metal which in turn becomes rolls of steel that could be sold to clients. Among SDI’s clients is Tesla which has made Texas its headquarters. “We do start with scrap metal probably 90% scrap. There may be some alternative irons that we do use to try and make the purification a little bit better but overall 90% scrap” Black remarked.

While Steel Dynamics’ Sinton TX plant is poised to begin initial operations next month there is still a lot of work to be done in the complex. The company is currently building another 300000-square-foot building on the site after it realized that it needed more space. So far about $1.9 billion have been invested in the Sinton facility which is estimated to have about 700 employees when it is operational.

The Steel Dynamics Sinton plant is located just about 167 miles away from Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas which should make the transportation of steel between the two facilities fairly straightforward. Interestingly enough previous comments from San Patricio County Judge David Krebs have hinted that Tesla would “redoing” the steel that it would be receiving from SDI at least before the material could be used for the Cybertruck’s exoskeleton.

“Now some of these other companies who work with SDI will actually be taking SDI’s product and refining it a little bit better. We’re hearing that one of the companies that were pretty close to–probably getting close–is a company that’s going to be taking SDI steel redoing it and that steel will actually be going into the Tesla cars that they’re moving in from California to manufacture here” the judge previously said.

While recent reports have suggested that the Cybertruck’s initial production would be around Q1 2023 development on the all-electric pickup truck seems to be going at a fair pace. Amidst sightings of updated prototypes in California Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated that he would be giving a product roadmap update later this month when the company holds its Q4 and FY 2021 earnings call.

UPDATE: Tesla Cybertruck steel supplier’s Sinton TX plant to start initial operations next month",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU2MDk1Mi90ZXNsYS1jeWJlcnRydWNrLXR3by1zaXplcy1ydW1vci_SAUdodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWV2cy5jb20vbmV3cy81NjA5NTIvdGVzbGEtY3liZXJ0cnVjay10d28tc2l6ZXMtcnVtb3IvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Cybertruck May Come In Two Sizes Be Revealed In March,"Elon Musk said at one point that it would make a lot of sense for Tesla to make a smaller Cybertruck but he never took the idea any further at least not publicly. He just said that it would make sense to have a more petit Cybertruck added to the range in the long run but that was in November of 2019 and we’ve not heard anything on the matter since - the smaller model was never officially confirmed.

Now we have information that Tesla may reveal the both versions during a special event expected to be held in March of 2022. The news comes from Trip Chowdhry an analyst with Global Equities Research and a known Tesla bull. He recently said that not only would the two versions be shown in March but also that both will feature ‘significant tweaks’ compared to the first Cybertruck shown.

He didn’t go into details as to what the changes are but he did say the smaller Cybertruck is around 15 to 20 percent smaller. Both vehicles’ shells will reportedly be built by the same company Steel Dynamics from Texas whose operation is located around 100 miles from Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.

Don’t expect Tesla to mention any of this in its next earnings call planned for Wednesday January 26 according to Chowdhry. We would also add that you should not expect Cybertruck deliveries to begin this year since a new report published by Reuters now puts its start of sales in early 2023 (production may begin around the end of this year).

The news agency says Tesla has postponed the Cybertruck for so long to make important changes to its design after seeing pickups from rival automakers appear on the scene with their own list of impressive specs and features. And there would certainly be a market for a smaller Cybertruck with other automakers already rumored to be working on such models.

The smaller Cybertruck would rival models like the rumored Ford Ranger EV and even Nissan is said to be working its own electric pickup in the same size bracket.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yYmlzY3VpdC5jb20vcmVwb3J0LWEtc2Vjb25kLXNtYWxsZXItdGVzbGEtY3liZXJ0cnVjay1pcy1jb21pbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report: A Second Smaller Tesla Cybertruck Is Coming,"A stock analyst with inside knowledge says that a smaller version of Tesla's Cybertruck is in the works to be unveiled at a special event happeneng in March.

Back in May 2020 Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that a smaller Cybertruck might be in the works at some point. Everyone thought “Sure someday maybe.” But now comes word through a big investor with inside Tesla knowledge that in fact there will be a smaller Cybertruck with the announcement coming this March.

A special Tesla event will debut a smaller Cybertruck

“We’ll probably do a smaller tight world truck at some point” Musk tweeted back in 2020. A special Tesla event is taking shape for March where a smaller version of the Cybertruck will be revealed according to a stock analyst with Global Equities Research. This coming from Inside EVs.

According to Trip Chowdhry this smaller version will be about 20 percent smaller than the one first shown in November 2019. Both truck’s bodies will be built by Steel Dynamics located about 100 miles from Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory where the Cybertruck or Cybertrucks will be made. News of this “event” probably won’t be part of an earnings call set for later this month.

The two versions to be shown will feature “significant tweaks” from the ones we’ve seen so far according to Chowdhry. What those tweaks might look like is not known. But certain compromises for pedestrian regulations and government-mandated manufacturing requirements would need to be incorporated into the design.

A smaller version of the Cybertruck has its advantages

Midsize full-size Cybertrucks | MB

A second smaller Cybertruck makes perfect sense especially with the backdrop of other automakers’ truck models. Virtually all of the standard-size pickup truck manufacturers offer at least one smaller pickup. Some like Ford have wedged in a third with its Maverick pickup that should be arriving to buyers any day.

Two Tesla Cybertrucks one smaller | MB

It also makes sense for it to be based on one of Tesla’s current sedans. Much of the development work has already been done and amortized when using existing platforms. And some automakers like Toyota make far more of their midsize Tacoma pickups than its full-size Tundra models.

Toyota sold more midsize pickups than full-size

The Toyota Tacoma | Toyota

In 2021 Toyota sold around 80000 Tundra pickups in the US. But its Tacoma trucks sold over 250000 last year. So you can see that there could be a big advantage for Tesla to offer a smaller Cybertruck.

And a number of manufacturers are working on all-electric versions of their midsize trucks including Nissan and Ford with a Ranger EV due in a couple of years. And the Ranger’s size is what Tesla is shooting for.

Finally Tesla needs something to buoy the news this week that the full-size Cybertruck has been delayed again. It will now reportedly be ready for production in 2023. Delays with new Tesla launches are very typical and supply chain issues plus starting production of an entirely new vehicle in a brand-new facility is a lot for any manufacturer to confront.",,,,,,

While AT&T was the biggest spender at $9 billion Dish spent $7.3 billion and T-Mobile followed behind at $2.9 billion. Verizon was notably absent from the auction. A number of smaller players also made the list like Three Forty-Five Spectrum which you can view on Light Reading’s site.

This is the third-largest FCC auction yet with total bids reaching about $22.5 billion

The auction officially ended in November but the FCC hasn’t publicly disclosed the winning bidders until now (PDF). Total bids reached about $22.5 billion making it the third-largest FCC spectrum auction yet. Only last year’s $80 billion C-band auction (over half of which was contributed by Verizon) and 2015’s $44.9 billion AWS-3 auction top this amount of spending as pointed out by Next TV (via Light Reading).

When it comes to using the 3.45GHz band however Light Reading says that companies will have to deploy new radios on cell towers that have the ability to broadcast signals across it. Smartphones that support C-band may already be capable of using the band Light Reading also notes as they both fall under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) n77 technical standards that cover 3.3GHz to 4.2GHz which existing 5G smartphones already use.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMTYvM2ctbmV0d29ya3Mtc2h1dHRpbmctZG93bi1pbi0yMDIyLWNvdWxkLWFmZmVjdC15b3VyLWNhcnMtZ3BzLmh0bWzSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wMS8xNi8zZy1uZXR3b3Jrcy1zaHV0dGluZy1kb3duLWluLTIwMjItY291bGQtYWZmZWN0LXlvdXItY2Fycy1ncHMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3G networks are shutting down — and that's bad news for your car. Here's why,"If you're driving certain models from Honda Nissan or Volvo you could be affected by AT&T's 3G shutdown. Verizon-aligned brands like Toyota and Lexus might have more time: Verizon says its 3G shutdown will happen "" no later "" than December 31. T-Mobile plans to shut down its Sprint and T-Mobile 3G networks between March and July.

As multiple auto blogs have pointed out recently the 3G shutdown will affect dozens of vehicle models released anytime between 2010 and 2021. Some cars will lose the ability to update your location and traffic data while navigating. Others will become unable to connect with your smartphone voice assistants or emergency call services.

However your car might be a different story.

Every major mobile carrier plans to shut down its 3G network this year largely to free up mobile bandwidth for upcoming 5G network rollouts. First up is AT&T which will shut down its 3G network on Feb. 22 . If your smartphones and tablets were purchased within the past decade they should have 4G capability meaning they'll likely be unaffected.

In fact 3G will soon be extinct — and that could mean bad news for your car.

The 3G wireless network was once among the world's hottest innovations. Today it feels old-fashioned with fifth-generation (5G) and even sixth-generation (6G) networks soon dominating the tech world.

For each of the 10 Audi models that will be affected by the 3G shutdown Audi's website offers an overview of the connected features that will be lost from online roadside assistance and stolen vehicle locator features to real-time fuel price and traffic light information.

Acura's website identifies seven different vehicle models with AcuraLink features running on 3G including real-time traffic and maintenance reminders emergency calls and enhanced roadside assistance services as well as some personal concierge services. The Japanese luxury brand which is owned by Honda says drivers should contact a dealer to update their car's hardware if they want to continue using those services after the 3G networks shut down.

Other carmakers like Bentley and Stellantis have acknowledged that some of their cars will be affected but have declined to specify which models.

Some major auto companies have released information on which of their car models will be affected by the shutdown — and what steps owners can take if any to ensure that their cars don't lose certain connected features once the shutdown occurs.

The German luxury automaker advises owners to visit a dealer to have their 3G hardware deactivated. Otherwise the shutdown will cause the vehicles to ""display a warning message…and emit an audible chime to warn the driver the vehicle is not connected and emergency services are not available.""

In December Audi and auto software company Mojio also announced a hardware update that should allow owners of the affected models to connect to 4G networks.

BMW:

In April 2021 BMW published an FAQ page noting that all ""vehicles factory equipped with 3G telematics devices or retrofitted 2G vehicles"" will be completely disconnected from its ConnectedDrive and BMW Assist services. The page declined to identify which models are included but according to The Drive you're safe if your car is from 2019 or later.

BMW said it would contact affected vehicle owners to inform them if their car is eligible for a free upgrade. Not all cars will be eligible according to the FAQ page.

General Motors:

Even relatively new General Motors cars might be affected: Last year CM and its OnStar connected features platform announced that the 3G shutdown will affect ""certain 2015 model year and newer GM vehicles.""

In October GM began offering wireless software updates to prepare its fleet for the shutdown which OnStar says will occur in February. According to OnStar the update occurs automatically for some car models while others will receive a prompt on the dashboard to accept installation of the software update.

The updates will continue ""until all affected vehicles have been successfully updated"" OnStar's website says.

Honda:

Accord Touring (2018-2020)

Odyssey's Touring and Elite versions (2018-2020)

Insight Touring (2019-2020)

Passport's Touring and Elite versions (2019-2021)

Pilot's Touring Elite and Black Edition versions (2019-2022)

Honda's website identifies February 22 2022 as the date that the 3G shutdown will affect a handful of its models. The company is offering a wireless software update that should reenable car features like remote locking enhanced roadside assistance and Wi-Fi hotspots.

Lexus:

According to Lexus all models produced by the Toyota-owned luxury brand between 2010 and 2017 will be affected by the 3G shutdown along with GX models from 2018. The shutdown for those cars' connected services will come on October 31 2022 at which point features like automatic collision notification and enhanced roadside assistance will stop working permanently.

So far Toyota and Lexus haven't announced any plans to offer software or hardware upgrades.

On its website Japanese automaker Subaru says its seven affected models will lose 3G connectivity in February affecting features like ""SOS emergency assistance"" and the ability to remotely lock and unlock your car. However a complimentary software update is available for subscribers to Subaru's Starlink Safety Plus or Security Plus connected services.

Tesla:

In July Tesla announced that its Model S luxury sedans built before June 2015 will lose network connectivity in February 2022 unless owners pay $200 at a Tesla dealer to install an upgraded LTE-capable modem.

Without the upgrade the affected Model S sedans will lose a variety of connected features including wireless software updates live traffic data music streaming and Tesla's Summon feature — which allows owners to remotely call their car in a parking lot to come pick them up nearby without a driver.

Toyota:

4Runner (2010-2019)

Tiguan (2014-2019)

Volkswagen's connected features are available to drivers on a subscription basis so if you aren't a paid subscriber you won't lose anything. However if you drive one of the above models and you have an active Car-Net subscription you'll lose features in February like emergency and roadside call assistance vehicle health reports and the ability to check fuel status remotely.

VW's website says ""additional information will be available in the coming months"" for customers who want to continue using the Car-Net platform after the shutdown and that drivers should ""please check back closer"" to the February shutdown date.

Volvo:

S60 (2015.5-2018

XC60 (2015.5-2017)

XC70 (2015.5-2016)

XC90 (2016)

Volvo's mobile partner is AT&T which means the affected vehicles will lose 3G connectivity in February. The shutdown will cut off features such as real-time traffic updates and in-car access to the Volvo On Call app that offers emergency assistance and remote tracking.

The Swedish company's website says it'll offer an upgrade to at least some owners of the affected vehicles who are directed to fill out an online form for more information.

Virgin Mobile customers will see an annual price rise of 3.9% above January’s RPI inflation rate for calls – currently prices increase in line with the RPI index – while Tesco Mobile pay-monthly customers face price rises from 9 February for sending picture messages calling internationally and adding more data to their plans.

Meanwhile this year Vodafone EE and Three plan to bring in a £2-a-day roaming charge for those travelling to Europe – potentially leading to heavy bills for families after two weeks in the sun.

So how can you save money while staying mobile?

Break up the bundle

Buying a bundled deal where the phone and the contract come together means you could miss out on better deals if the two are taken separately.

With O2 you can buy a new iPhone 13 on a 24-month contract with 150GB of data and unlimited calls and texts for just under £50 a month – £28 of which is for data and calls.

But if you were to buy the phone separately you could get a sim-only deal with O2 for £15 with 100GB of data. This also means you can choose the length of time you commit to a contract usually from one month onwards.

There are numerous sites where the best deals can be compared: MoneySavingExpert Uswitch and GoCompare among them.

Shelling out large amounts for a new mobile will not possible for everyone however. Apple operates an iPhone upgrade programme through its stores when the cost of one of the phones can be spread over 20 months.

A 0% credit card allows you to roll out the price – Barclaycard currently has one for up to 24 months while the M&S card runs up to 23 months.

However consumers will have to go through credit checks to get a 0% card and should ensure they pay off the money during the period – essentially treating the card as a loan.

Consumers nearing the end of their phone and sim contract should always consider breaking up the two or at least switching says Lisa Barber of consumer organisation Which? “Otherwise you could end up paying for a phone that you’ve already paid off” she says.

Search for the best deal

There is often good value to be found with so-called “mobile virtual network operators” (MVNOs) such as iD Mobile Talkmobile Tesco Mobile and Plusnet among many others.

These operators lease their networks from the four main providers and can often provide attractive deals as they have lower overheads says Hannah Isitt of GoCompare.

“The mobile signal will be identical but you won’t really get the same added benefits of a bigger network – things like O2 Priority free Netflix subscriptions family plans 24/7 customer service free wifi hotspot use” says Kim Staples from MoneySuperMarket.

Find better value data

After years of hype 5G is now standard on new mobiles meaning users can access a lot more a lot faster.

It can be up to 10 times faster than 4G – a movie will download in seconds rather than minutes. But in terms of bills users may find themselves using an awful lot more data as they take advantage of the faster speeds.

Ernest Doku a mobiles expert from Uswitch warns to be very wary of how you use a new 5G device. “While you have the ability to stream videos without interruption you’ll also find that it has the potential to guzzle your data.”

There is good news however in that data deals are becoming more competitive.

Those with higher limits start from about £12 a month. Talkmobile has 50GB for £5.97 a month for three months and then £11.95 after. For 100GB Talkmobile also costs £11.95 with a one-month contract. For unlimited data Three and iD Mobile have 12-month contracts at £18 a month.

Anyone who thinks they can use the extra data by connecting other devices – “tethering” – to their mobile should check the small print to see whether there are any limits on how much they can share. “Check that tethering or using a wifi hotspot is allowed as part of your data bundle and that there are no restrictions. This is particularly important on unlimited data deals” says Barber.

New roaming rules

Since Brexit mobile operators have the option of reintroducing roaming charges for UK consumers who travel to Europe. Vodafone plans to introduce a £2 daily charge by the end of January. Three says there will be a £2 fee from May and EE from March. But Virgin Media and O2 customers have been told they will not face any roaming charges.

While there are some deals to avoid the full effect of the charge – EE has a 30-day roaming pass for £10 and Vodafone has eight and 15-day passes which reduce the daily price to £1 – costs could still easily mount up. A family of four all with mobiles face the possibility of a £112 bill for using their phones every day over two weeks on the continent.

The easiest way to avoid the charge is to simply turn off roaming and use whatever wifi is available.

Since it is now relatively easy to switch provider anyone who wants to move to another operator which does not have roaming charges should see whether they will be penalised for leaving a contract early says Isitt.

Easy savings

Changing phones will leave you with a potentially valuable old phone which can be traded in to take the edge off the bill for a new one. An iPhone XR can fetch £175 if in top condition from the musicMagpie site while a Samsung Galaxy S9 can net £81.

There are any number of sites where you can sell phones – from those run by manufacturers to companies linked to the resellers – but the price quoted can quickly drop depending on the condition. A minor scratch on the screen of an iPhone XR can decrease the amount from £160 to £40 with Apple.

“You might want to think about other options – for example your old device might make a great first phone for your child or it could become a second phone for a student to take with them when they go backpacking or even as a spare to keep in the house for emergencies.”

Students can often get discounts through sites such as UniDays while members of the emergency services NHS social care sector and armed forces can get discounts by using the Blue Light Card which costs just under a fiver for two years.

The S&P 500's 2022 struggles continued as bank stocks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season by reporting mixed numbers.

On Tuesday Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee as part of his reconfirmation process. Powell said persistently elevated inflation is a signal the U.S. economy ""no longer needs or wants"" highly accommodative monetary policy measures but added that the ""era of very low interest rates"" is likely here to stay.

Following Powell's testimony the U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday that the consumer price index increased by 7% in December the highest inflation recorded since 1982. The CPI reading was up 0.5% compared with November and in line with economist estimates.

On Monday video game developer Take-Two Interactive announced a $12.7 billion buyout of Zynga maker of popular social media game ""FarmVille."" The $9.86-per-share buyout price represented a 64% premium to Zynga's previous week's closing share price.

Casino stocks Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts rallied on Friday after the Macau government released a draft of a new bill outlining the license renewal process for Macau casino operators. Macau will maintain a maximum of six total licenses suggesting it's likely the current six Macau operators will all have their licenses renewed for 10 years.

JPMorgan withdrawal

Shares of U.S. megabank JPMorgan Chase dropped more than 5% on Friday morning after the company reported a fourth quarter earnings beat but cut its 2022 financial guidance and said ""inflationary pressures"" will increase expenses by 8% this year.

Investors will get more fourth-quarter earnings numbers in the week ahead including reports from Bank of America UnitedHealth and Procter & Gamble on Wednesday and Netflix on Thursday.

S&P 500 companies are on track to report full-year 2021 earnings growth of 45.3% according to FactSet.

Economic numbers

In the week ahead investors will get key economic updates from Asia on Monday when the National Bureau of Statistics of China releases its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate and on Friday when the People's Bank of China releases its latest interest rate decision.

Rockstar Games may have delayed the new next-gen version of GTA V by as much as two months.

A bit ago Rockstar Games pushed its GTA V Expanded & Enhanced version to March 2022. Now according to Portuguese Rockstar news tracker Matheusvictorbr it's possible GTA V could be delayed as far as May 2022 on PS5 and Xbox Series X.

""I received some information recently regarding the title: Grand Theft Auto V: Expanded And Enhanced: The development was complicated. At the moment its [release] is still in March but there are great chances that it will be delayed to April/May"" Mathheus said on Twitter.

Grand Theft Auto Online's standalone version has also proven to be much more intricate than originally thought. Sources say Rockstar is having trouble keeping up with the current GTA Online's big evolution and changes--and two more SKUs mean two more platforms to support (three if you count the Xbox Series S).

""Their original plan was the same (talking about just upgrading the last-gen versions with patches) with a GTA Online Standalone launching sometime in 2021. But with the growth and evolution of GTA Online it needs to have a engine that can withstand the precision and constant growth ahead. Since they are doing a re-adaptation...As I mentioned a while ago Rockstar Games is preparing 3 amazing things for GTA Online. I can't say much but pack your bags.""

Pricing and availability are subject to change.

This week in racing game news:

The ""Hot Wheels Unleashed"" Design Battle contest winner will see their design sold worldwide - but that's it

Starting today ""Hot Wheels Unleashed"" players can compete for the chance to have their very own in-game livery design sold as a real-life Hot Wheels toy worldwide. Using the robust livery editor in ""Hot Wheels Unleashed"" players can create an impressively wide range of designs. Until Feb. 14 you'll be able to upload up to 100 different designs for consideration. If you win Mattel will use your design to make a real life Hot Wheels toy.

On the surface this sounds like a pretty cool opportunity but unfortunately the prize seems to only amount to having the privilege of seeing a multi-million dollar business line their pockets with earnings from your hard work while the lucky designer receives as far as we can tell absolutely nothing at all. The terms and conditions of the contest bluntly point out that ""recognition of personal merit constitutes the 'prize' for the creator of the selected work"" and that if you win ""by signing the letter of acceptance and transfer of rights the author of the graphic selected as the winner will assign to Mattel Inc. without any exclusion all the rights of copyright and economic exploitation for the purposes of the production of the vehicle described above without time or territorial limits with express waiver by the author of any and all economic claims against Mattel Inc. the promoter company and their successors in title.""

That doesn't seem like much of a ""prize"" to us but if you still want to enter you'll have until Feb. 14 to do it.

The next ""Twisted Metal"" is officially in the works at Sony

VGC has reported that a new ""Twisted Metal"" is finally on the horizon and the project is being led by Sony's first-party Firesprite studio. Interestingly Firesprite mostly has experience in creating games for Playstation VR which begs the question could we be getting a virtual reality version of the upcoming battle royale racer? Hopefully we won't have to wait long to find out since with a TV adaptation on the way as well it sure seems like Sony is gearing up for a big murder-y ice cream truck push in the very near future.

Take-Two finally remembers ""Midnight Club"" exists but it feels like our wish was granted via monkey's paw

Over the past week it was widely reported that Take-Two Interactive owner of monster development houses like Rockstar and 2K Games has purchased Zynga (prolific mobile game developer) in a multi-billion dollar deal. That's either exciting or devastating depending on your perspective on mobile games but one undeniably interesting tidbit came out of the news as IGN reported that during an investor call Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick actually acknowledged ""Midnight Club"" in a graphic while referencing the company owning some of ""the most iconic brands in the world."" This marks the first sign of life for the franchise in many years and while it's exciting that a reference to the game probably means that it isn't completely dead fans of the franchise are already worried that with Zynga's involvement the next ""Midnight Club"" could be relegated to mobile instead of being a full-fledged console game. Only time will tell of course and hey maybe a mobile ""Midnight Club"" could be good? We'll just have to wait and see."

The school will become the country’s first Historically Black College or University (HBCU) to ever reopen — and education leaders said the institution is poised to make Detroit an epicenter of design and champion Black designers in a design field that remains overwhelmingly white. (About 73% of those in the design industry are white and 3% are Black according to the American Institute of Graphic Arts a professional association for design.)

Founded by Violet T. Lewis a nationally renowned Black businesswoman and educator the school was originally known as the Lewis College of Business and operated in Detroit from 1939 to 2013. After it closed because of accreditation challenges there were numerous attempts to reopen the school that received its HBCU designation in 1987.

Now it’s just a matter of months before Michigan’s first — and only — HBCU will welcome students to its campus at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit.

“I am tremendously excited about the reopening of Lewis College as Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design as an HBCU” College for Creative Studies President Don Tuski said. “The impact will be great for Detroit and for many diverse students who will have another choice for design school.”

HBCUs were established in the 19th century to provide educational opportunities to people of African descent interested in obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees but because of systemic racism not welcomed at existing public and private higher educational institutions. The majority of HBCUs originated between 1865 and 1900 with the greatest number starting in 1867 — two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The majority about 89% of HBCUs are located in the southern United States. Currently the closest ones to Michigan are in Illinois and Ohio.

The new higher education program at Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design is being crafted with D’Wayne Edwards Founder of PENSOLE Design Academy in Portland Ore. He is laying out plans for the school with his co-founding partners at the College for Creative Studies the Gilbert Family Foundation and Target. The Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design will serve as the pipeline HBCU for career education and professional development in the design industry a field in education that Edwards said is not accessible in existing HBCUs.

With more than 33 years of expertise as a trained footwear designer for several major brands followed by a career in teaching and education Edwards’ inspiration for taking on this initiative is to make design opportunities and career possibilities more accessible to people of color through education that combines design and business.

“As educators we also have to do our part and provide learning opportunities that help redirect these young minds into opportunities that they feel they are a part of and want to be a part of” Edwards said.

Over the past 12 years PENSOLE Design Academy has played a major role in the sportswear industry to pull new diverse talent in design Edwards said. Upon learning of the Lewis Business College and its founder Edwards researched and pursued the history of the college. He also connected with the real estate agent listing the location and the family of Lewis the school’s founder which led to the process of reopening the college. Pensole Lewis College will offer programs in design sustainability business and STEM.

Lewis founded the Lewis College of Business in Indiana in 1929. She moved the school which was primarily for women to Detroit in 1941. In 2018 then-Gov. Rick Snyder signed a bill sponsored by then-Sen. Ian Conyers (D-Detroit) renaming a portion of the John C. Lodge Freeway (M-10) in Detroit for Lewis.

Edwards admits that he had not previously heard of Lewis or the history of Lewis College but he was drawn to her story and her entrepreneurial thinking. By blending design and business with the reinstatement of Pensole Lewis College along with the relationships developed between the design industry and companies Edwards said he is confident the institution will be sustainable and will increase racial diversity in both the participating companies and the design field.

Edwards added the feedback and support from the city of Detroit and the state have been positive.

“The state has embraced what we’re doing” Edwards said.

At the end of December Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed House Bills 5447 and 5448 which reestablish the Lewis College of Business as the Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design.

“I am proud to play a part in helping reopen the Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design in Detroit” Whitmer said in a press statement. “I am committed to expanding educational opportunities for Michiganders across our state to put Michigan first.”

State Rep. Joe Tate (D-Detroit) who co-sponsored both bills noted there has been bipartisan support for the legislation and Sen. Marshall Bullock (D-Detroit) chair of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus called the college’s reopening a “tremendous opportunity for Detroit and the Black community on so many levels.”

I am tremendously excited about the reopening of Lewis College as Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design as an HBCU. The impact will be great for Detroit and for many diverse students who will have another choice for design school. – College for Creative Studies President Don Tuski

“I’m eager to see the ingenuity that will once again come from students at the Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design as well as the future they envision for their communities” Bullock said in a press statement.

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan also has thrown his support behind the college.

“As a predominantly Black city this helps send a clear message that we are building one city for everyone with opportunity for everyone” Duggan said in a prepared statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3JhZGxlLmNvL2FydGljbGVzLWlkLzUwMDPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drones target airbase housing US troops on the outskirts of Baghdad,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbWFya2V0L21vdGhlcnNvbi1zdW1pLXNoYXJlcy10b2RheS1wbHVtbWV0LWFzLXN0b2NrLXRyYWRlcy1leC1kb21lc3RpYy13aXJpbmctaGFybmVzcy1idXNpbmVzcy0xMTY0MjE0ODM2MTAxMi5odG1s0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9tYXJrZXQvbW90aGVyc29uLXN1bWktc2hhcmVzLXRvZGF5LXBsdW1tZXQtYXMtc3RvY2stdHJhZGVzLWV4LWRvbWVzdGljLXdpcmluZy1oYXJuZXNzLWJ1c2luZXNzL2FtcC0xMTY0MjE0ODM2MTAxMi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Motherson Sumi demerger: What it means for the stock? | Mint,"Shares of Motherson Sumi Systems plummeted as much as 9% on the BSE and over 20% on the NSE in Friday's trading session as the stock started trading ex-domestic wiring harness (DWH) business ahead of the record date which is fixed on Monday January 17 2021.

The auto parts maker will determine shareholders for allocation of additional shares of DWH business in the entitlement ratio of 1:1 on its record date. SAMIL will be the new name for existing listed entity after the de-merger of DWH business and merger with parent entity. The merger with the promoter entity is expected to take place on 24th January. MSWIL's listing is expected in mid-March subject to regulatory approvals.

""At its analyst call management re-emphasized expectations of better content per vehicle helped by increasing EV penetration in both the entities - DWH and SAMIL"" highlighted Emkay in a note on January 10. It has a Buy rating on the stock with a target price of ₹300.

The brokerage expects robust growth prospects for the auto parts maker in the medium term driven by expectations of a cyclical upturn in the underlying auto segment in domestic/global markets and increasing content per vehicle due to premiumization/electrification.

“In addition the proposed restructuring exercise creates a platform for future growth through inorganic and organic routes. This restructuring exercise is a step toward the company's Vision 2025 - revenue target of $36bn with ROCE of 40%"" Emkay added.

Motherson Sumi's stock price has grown at around 13% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from around ₹145 levels in January 2017 widely outperforming the Nifty Auto index.

Brokerage house ICICI Securities retains Hold rating on the stock with separate fair value target prices of the demerged entity (DWH) as well as new SAMIL.

“We value the combined entity post-merger of erstwhile SAMIL into MSSL at ₹270 per share. Consequently our target for individual entities i.e. DWH and new SAMIL (ex-DWH) is at ₹70 and ₹200 respectively"" the broker's note on January 10 stated.

The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies and not of Mint.

Not only that but members of the notorious group REvil which has been behind some of the biggest attacks of the past several years including the ones on IT management firm Kaseya and meat giant JBS. Russian president Vladimir Putin had previously given ransomware hackers a free pass. It's not clear yet whether this was a calculated political move a sign of a broader crackdown or both but it's certainly a watershed moment.

As everyone scrambles to find Log4j in their systems—no easy task for even well-resourced companies—the FTC has set strict deadlines for patching the very bad no good vulnerability in the ubiquitous logging library. It'll be unlikely if not impossible for everyone to find it in time which speaks more to the fragile and opaque nature of the open source software world than the FTC's aggressive timeline.

Telecoms around the world have pushed back against Apple's Private Relay a not-quite-VPN that bounces your traffic through a couple of servers to give you extra anonymity. T-Mobile in the US recently blocked it for customers who had parental control filters. It's unclear why they've taken those measures against Apple and not the many many VPNs that work unfettered but it may have to do with the potential scale of Apple customers who could sign up for the service.

In other Apple privacy news iOS 15 brought with it a new report that shows you what sensors your apps are accessing and what domains they're contacting. It's a lot of information all at once; we helped break down how to read it.

North Korean hackers had a “banner year” in 2021 stealing nearly $400 million of cryptocurrency. And while Israeli spyware vendor NSO Group insists that it has controls in place to prevent abuses of its product dozens of journalists and activists in El Salvador had their devices infected with Pegasus NSO's signature product as recently as November.

And that's not all! Each week we round up all the security news WIRED didn’t cover in depth. Click on the headlines to read the full stories.

A 19-year-old security researcher named David Colombo detailed this week how he was able to remotely unlock the doors open the windows blast music and start keyless driving for dozens of Teslas. The vulnerabilities he exploited to do so aren't in Tesla software itself but in a third-party app. There are some limits to what Colombo could accomplish; he couldn't do anything in the way of steering or speeding up or slowing down. But he was able to garner lots of sensitive data about the affected vehicles. Cars are computers now perhaps none more so than Teslas which means they come with computer problems like third-party software causing major problems.

As tensions mount along the border between Russia and Ukraine someone defaced over 70 official Ukrainian government websites this week placing a notice that people should “prepare for the worst.” While it's tempting to assume that it was the work of the Russian government this isn't a particularly sophisticated hack despite the widespread impact and visibility. (That's also not to say it wasn't Russia; it's just impossible to know right now.) The White House also warned this week that Russia was planning a “false flag” to justify an invasion so presumably more to come on this.

The US hasn't embraced Covid-19 contact-tracing apps despite the core functionality being built into every iOS and Android phone. Other countries though have seen much wider adoption. That includes Germany where police recently used data from the Luca contact-tracing app to figure out who had been at a specific restaurant on a specific night in November and used that information to identify 21 potential witnesses. Law enforcement has said they won't use that data any further after a public outcry. But the incident represents exactly the kind of worst-case scenario privacy advocates had warned about at a time when public confidence in contact tracing is more important than ever.

The developer behind two widely used open source libraries effectively broke his own code this week disrupting thousands of projects in the process. The changes caused applications to print nonsense messages in an infinite loop. The developer appeared motivated to make a statement about large companies profiting off of his work for free but in the process made life pretty miserable for users of all stripes.

A lawyer for Tesla asked a law firm to fire one its attorneys or risk losing its work for the electric automaker led by Elon Musk The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday.

The lawyer that Tesla wanted Cooley LLP to fire previously worked at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The attorney interviewed Musk in the agency's probe into the Tesla CEO's 2018 claim that he obtained funding to take Tesla private according to the publication. The investigation led to a settlement under which Musk and Tesla agreed to pay a $20 million fine each and Musk agreed to step down for three years as Tesla chairman.

Tesla's lawyer late last year asked Cooley to fire the attorney who worked on the SEC investigation the Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. The firm did not remove the associate.

Tesla has moved to replace Cooley or hire additional lawyers on several cases since December according to the Journal.

Musk's rocket company SpaceX has also stopped working with the law firm on regulatory issues the Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter.

Tesla has its own ties to the SEC. The company hired David Misler a former trial attorney for the agency as a managing counsel.

Musk has clashed with more regulators than the SEC. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has investigated whether Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance system is at least partly to blame for crashes in which Tesla cars ran into parked first responder vehicles.

The agency brought on Missy Cummings – a Duke University professor automated systems expert former Navy fighter pilot and Tesla critic – as an advisor in the probe. Musk in October tweeted that ""her track record is extremely biased against Tesla"" sparking an outcry among his followers.

The NHTSA later required Cummings to recuse herself from Tesla-specific matters the Journal reported Saturday.

Tesla SpaceX and Cooley did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests to comment.

Like all Tesla's vehicles the Model Y earned the highest-possible rating during these tests. But there was also a surprise.

Above: Tesla Model 3 and Model Y perform crash testing (Source: Above: Tesla Model 3 and Model Y perform crash testing (Source: IIHS

When looking carefully at the results it's clear that the Model Y electric SUV has proven even safer than the Model 3. This is because Tesla employs continuous improvement methodology both on the factory floor and in its software development for its cars.

These tests prove that Tesla Model Y has taken the crown from Model 3 for being the vehicle with the least probability of injury. Interestingly this allows the entire Tesla lineup (including Model S 3 X and Y) to occupy all of the top rankings for the world's safest vehicles now.

That said let's take a look at a few of IIHS's highlights from Model Y's crash tests — especially in comparison with Model 3.

DRIVER-SIDE SMALL OVERLAP FRONTAL TEST

With the Model Y's advancement in body structure design — Tesla's smaller SUV performed better than Model 3 in the “Driver-side small overlap frontal crash test”. This particular test simulates the collision that can occur primarily through the vehicle’s driver-side wheel well instead of the center crumple zone.

Model Y successfully redirected the passenger compartment away from the point of collision instead of trying to absorb the impact through the front crumple zone itself. Model 3 did good in this test but did not redirect as much as Model Y.

The numbers coming out of both Model Y and Model 3 tests are even more interesting. For example in this driver-side small overlap frontal test Model 3 had 21 cm of footwell intrusion while Model Y had only 1 cm of intrusion. This is an impressive achievement on behalf of the Tesla safety engineering team.

Tesla Model Y also performed around three times better in the head injury criterion (HIC) — Model Y scored 22 points and Model 3 had scored 88 points in this test. The concussion mark is set at 250 points for head injury by the IIHS.

MODERATE OVERLAP FRONT TEST

In the moderate overlap front crash test the vehicle strikes a 2 foot tall deformable honeycomb barrier offset at 10% from its centerline at a speed of 40 mph (64.3 km/h). This tests the safety of the entire front crumple zone of a vehicle.

When compared side-by-side Model Y performed better in the moderate overlap front test vs Model 3. As a result of the impact the Model 3 windshield had fractured. Meanwhile due to its height and impact absorption mechanism the Model Y windshield stayed intact.

Like the previous small overlap Model Y performed well in the head injury collision (HIC). While the dummy in Model 3 experienced a HIC of 177 the one in the Model Y got only 107 — well below the concussion mark of 250.

In the t-bone collision test Model Y did exceptionally well especially for the front passenger most probably due to its higher sitting position compared to the Model 3.

The dummy in the Model 3 experienced a head injury collision (HIC) of 237 (just below the 250 concussion mark) vs. the Model Y-front passenger which only received a HIC of just 120 points.

Also Model 3 had scored a torso deflection rate (TDR) of 5.2 meters per second while Model Y did much better with a TDR of just 3.91 m/s.

ROOF STRENGTH

This is the only area where the Tesla Model 3 performed better than the Model Y due to its shorter roofline and perhaps also due to the high-strength steel cross member that expands from b-pillar to b-pillar. This cross member steel bar is not present in the Model Y.

In the roof strength test Model 3 got a 5.85 strength-to-weight ratio score while Model Y received a 4.2.

We recently witnessed a Tesla Model 3 showing the incredible strength of its roof when a large tree trunk fell on it and all the occupants walked away without any injury.

Candy Montgomery embarked on affair with her best friend's husband — an affair that ended with 41 axe strokes.

Texas Church Lady Admits To Killing Friend With An Axe — And Still Gets Away With It

Candy Montgomery was thought of as a pillar of her community. That perception changed however after she had an affair with a married man and killed his wife with an axe.

How to Watch Watch Snapped on Oxygen Sundays 6/5c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Oxygen App.

Born Candace Wheeler Candy grew up an Army brat moving from base to base throughout her childhood. She eventually married a man named Pat Montgomery who worked as an electrical engineer at Texas Instruments. In 1977 the Montgomerys moved to Collin County Texas and had two children a son and a daughter. Candy was a full-time mom and the family’s social life revolved around the First United Methodist Church of Lucas.

“Candy was a really outgoing likable person. She was very involved in her community her church she was in the choir she taught Sunday school” Robert Udashen a defense attorney told “Snapped” streaming now Oxygen.com.

It was through church that Pat and Candy befriended Allan and Betty Gore. Like Pat Allan worked as an electrical engineer with a Dallas-based tech company. Candy and Betty hit it off as well.

Born in 1950 Betty Pomeroy grew up in a small town in Kansas. She was one of three children and had two younger brothers.

“She was very popular. She was involved in all kinds of school events music plays student council. She wanted to be an elementary school teacher really from the word go” Betty’s brother Ronald Pomeroy told “Snapped.”

While in college Betty met Allan Gore a teaching assistant in one of her classes. After the class ended they began dating and married in 1970. Following the birth of their daughter Alisa the family moved to Collin County where Betty became a teacher in the local school system.

In 1979 Betty gave birth to her second child Bethany. Afterward she suffered from postpartum depression putting a strain on her marriage.

What Happened To Betty Gore?

Around 11 p.m. on Friday June 13 1980 Allan called his neighbor Richard Parker and asked him to check on Betty. Allan was in Minnesota on business and couldn’t get in touch with her.

Parker and another neighbor Lester Gayler went to the Gore home to investigate. “I went in first” Gayler told The Dallas Morning News. “We went down the hall to the bathroom turning on lights. A little old baby raised its head up out of the crib out of the baby bed. It began to cry. It’d been there all nearly all day hadn’t been fed or nothing.”

The men followed a trail of blood to the house’s utility room. On the floor lay the bloody remains of Betty Gore. Her head and body were so badly mutilated that the men thought she had suffered a shotgun blast. A few feet away from her body was a three-foot long wood-handled axe.

An autopsy would determine Betty had been struck 41 times with the axe according to Texas Monthly magazine. 28 of the blows were to her head and face. Investigators believed the brutal nature of the murder indicated her killer knew her.

“Betty Gore’s Crime Scene Was Unusual” Detective Says

“It was a vicious set of blows to the body the face the arms the head the torso even into the legs” former chief of physical evidence in Dallas Dr. Irv Stone told “Snapped.”

The killer had tried to clean up the crime scene but gave up when they realized there was too much blood. A bloody thumbprint was found on a freezer as well as a bloody shoe print in the laundry room. Blood on the bathroom wall and drain revealed the killer had washed off in the shower.

A pot of burnt coffee indicated the murder happened in the morning. Investigators wondered if Allan had murdered his wife before flying to Minnesota — however the bloody footprint didn’t match his foot size.

“We were looking for someone small in stature whether it was a child or a woman” former Collin County investigator Steven Deffibaugh told “Snapped.”

How Was Candy Montgomery Caught?

A 5-year-old who was friends with with Alisa Gore said she went to their house on the morning of the murder. When she knocked on the door no one answered. Around 11 a.m. she saw Candy Montgomery leave the house.

Montgomery was brought in for questioning. She explained that Alisa Gore had slept over at her house the previous night and that she stopped by to get a swimsuit from Betty. Afterward she went to church where she was teaching a Bible class to children out on summer vacation.

Investigators interviewed Allan Gore on June 16 just hours after Betty was laid to rest. He said his marriage had been good but admitted he and Betty got into a fight before he left for Minnesota. Betty was afraid she was pregnant again.

The next morning Allan called detectives to get something off his chest. He told them that for the better part of the past year he had been having an affair with Candy Montgomery.

Allan said it had been Candy’s idea. “Would you be interested in having an affair?” she asked him matter of factly after a church volleyball game according to Texas Monthly.

Both were sexually unsatisfied in their marriages but neither wanted a divorce. The affair was meticulously planned with Allan and Candy splitting motel rentals and meeting every other week for sex before or after a picnic lunch.

Allan and Candy agreed to end the affair if they got too close. Allan broke things off with Candy after he and Betty attended a church-sponsored couples retreat meant to mend troubled marriages.

Detectives brought her back for questioning later that day. “Her position at that point was she didn’t have anything to do with the killing” said Udashen. She was asked to take a polygraph test but refused.

The fingerprints and footprints found at the crime scene were enough to secure an arrest warrant. Candy Montgomery was arrested on June 27 1980 and charged with Betty Gore’s murder.

“She’s arrested and I’m the one to actually read her rights. Some female jailers strip searched her and take off all her clothes and that’s when they notice all these bruises and also a cut on her toe” said Deffibaugh.

Why Did Candy Montgomery Kill Betty Gore?

At her murder trial in October 1980 Candy's lawyers unveiled their defense strategy. “Candy Montgomery did kill Betty Gore and she did so in self-defense” said Udashen.

Candy took the stand in her own defense and claimed that when she arrived at the Gore house Betty confronted her about the affair. She said Betty came at her with an axe swinging it down to the floor and cutting Candy’s toe.

According to Candy the two women then wrestled for control of the weapon. After grabbing the axe Candy says she knocked Betty to the floor. Betty kept coming at her so she claimed she had no choice but to strike her with the axe.

Prosecutors contend that the 41 strikes Candy rained down on Betty went far beyond a simple act of self-defense. Candy’s defense however called upon a psychologist who testified a traumatic childhood memory of Candy's had been triggered when Betty told her “Shhhh” according to Texas Monthly.

“I hit her. I hit her. I hit her” Candy said on the stand according to The Dallas Morning News.

Did Candy Montgomery Go To Jail?

After deliberating for under four hours the jury acquitted Candy Montgomery of the murder of Betty Gore on the basis of self-defense. “Murderer! Murderer!” people screamed at her as she left the courthouse according to the United Press International news service.

After Candy’s acquittal the Montgomerys moved to Georgia and later divorced. Candy now goes by her maiden name and works as a mental health therapist according to the UK’s Daily Mail.

See it in MTV's 'Cutting Edge',"Do you remember Austin in 1985? Or have you wondered what the city and its music scene were like back then?

Here's an ideal way to relive those days or see them for the first time. MTV came to town that summer to film an episode of ""The Cutting Edge"" a program produced by I.R.S. Records that explored emerging music communities around the nation. The full episode was just added to Vimeo this week by Carlos Grasso who produced the program.

The hourlong show captured around a dozen acts who were all the rage in the local clubs at the time. There's footage of the True Believers Zeitgeist (later known as the Reivers) Timbuk3 Joe King Carrasco & the Crowns Doctors' Mob Glass Eye Tail Gators Poison 13 Dharma Bums Wild Seeds Toshio Hirano Dino Lee's White Trash Revue — and making his national TV debut Daniel Johnston.

Host Peter Zaremba cruises around town with a camera crew riding shotgun with Carrasco (who waxes rhapsodic about a long-gone Rainey Street district car lot called Red River Motors) and feasting on fajitas at a backyard barbecue. Many of the bands are briefly interviewed atop a building under construction downtown with cranes looming in every direction as the city's skyline begins to transform.

Most of the music was filmed at two venues just north and south of Lady Bird Lake (Town Lake back then). ""Liberty Lunch one of tonight's featured clubs won't be around much longer"" Zaremba states at one point though it turned out the fabled music haven marched on for another 14 years. Much shorter lived was South Bank a venue on Barton Springs Road that later became the restaurant Zax (recently shuttered).

Sprinkled between band performances are a handful of poems by Randy Turner a.k.a. Biscuit best-known as leader of pioneering punk band the Big Boys who'd split up a year before the program was filmed.

I.R.S. created ""The Cutting Edge"" partly as a means of discovering up-and-coming artists. The label did sign one band featured in the episode: Timbuk3 who performed at South Bank away from their usual home base of Hole in the Wall. There's also footage of them performing on the front stoop of their house at 5605 Bennett St.re in North Austin.

Zaremba also popped in to the original South Lamar Boulevard location of Waterloo Records snapping up vinyl albums by the likes of Texas Instruments Big Guitars from Texas the Offenders and others. ""Indie releases can be hard to find"" he offers. ""They're worth looking for.""

Taken together the ""Cutting Edge"" episode and director Richard Linklater's debut film ""Slacker"" — which recently marked its 30th anniversary with Paramount Theatre screening — serve as increasingly valuable visual snapshots of what Austin was like in the 1980s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhdW50b25nYXpldHRlLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3RhdW50b24tZ2F6ZXR0ZV9jbjE0MDA1NjI40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edward M.

Forget paying over the odds for a Google Chromecast Audio on eBay. Step over the Raspberry Pi’s microSD card write and OS configuration. The Wiim Mini is probably the most affordable and simplest way to add Bluetooth Spotify Connect Tidal Connect and (the Roon friendly) Apple AirPlay 2 to a hi-fi system. Connect the Mini to your home wifi network hook it into an amplifier (or DAC) and you’re off to the races with a suite of streaming possibilities. Gapless playback guaranteed Wiim’s proposition is very much plug-n-play.

Inside the hockey-puck-sized device – it measures 7cm across – an internal Texas Instruments DAC circuit offers support for PCM up to 24bit/192kHz. Analogue output comes via a 3.5mm socket. No MQA. No DSD. For those already in possession of an external DAC the Wiim Mini offers a TOSLINK output that bit-perfect purists beware resamples everything to 48kHz. That’s on par with the €50 Google Chromecast-fuelled Xiaomi Mi Box S. However the Q&A section of this wallet-friendly streamer’s Amazon.ca listing suggests a forthcoming firmware update will upgrade TOSLINK to 24bit/192kHz.

Rounding out the Wiim Mini’s feature set is a 3.5mm analogue input a microphone that assists with synchronising multi-room AirPlay 2 playback capacitive touch controls (for volume up/down play/pause) and Siri/Alexa voice assistant integration. Power comes via USB-C presumably a 5V ‘phone charger’.

For €99 or US$99 that’s not a bad deal at all. In fact that’s a really good deal.

One final thought: the Wiim Mini isn’t new. It’s just new to me. This post isn’t the result of a press release spilling from the manufacturer but an email from a Darko.Audio reader. A second reader then got in touch to confirm the absence DSD and MQA support and to give me (and you!) the heads-up about the TOSLINK socket’s resampled 48kHz output. A third reader then emailed to tell me that bit-perfection from that same TOSLINK socket might be arriving via a firmware update later this year.

The United States military is finally replacing the beloved M4 along with the M249 squad automatic weapon (SAW). This change is said to be coming in 2021. This will be the first major weapons platform change since 1994 when the M4 became the standard issue rifle for the United States military. Now it’s time for a change. Not only is the military swapping out platforms but it’s also changing calibers.

The military was seeking out something that had manageable recoil and high velocity like 5.56 but also wanted something with superior stopping power like 7.62. Despite having lethality on its side the U.S. wanted to avoid the heaviness and higher recoil of the 7.62 cartridge. This ended with the selection of 6.8 mm.

6.8 mm was specifically designed to address the long-distance ballistics issues of 5.56 NATO and serve as a way to close the gap between 5.56 and 7.62. It can’t match the stopping power of the 7.62 but it’s lighter faster and has less recoil. 6.8 is also more easily controlled in burst fire.

There are 3 contenders bidding to be the new platform for the new 6.8mm: Sig Sauer General Dynamics and Textron Systems.

Sig Sauer brings the MCX Spear to the table sporting a familiar design to the M4. Meaning little additional training will be necessary for soldiers to adapt to the new platform. Its weight is probably the same as the M4 as well but no specifics have been given except that it’s under 10 pounds. What’s interesting is that all Spear rifles come with a built-in suppressor to counter the muzzle blast (recoil) from the new cartridge. Eventually the MCX Spear will be fitted with a fire control group called the Vortex system. It’s a suite of optics rangefinders and even a ballistic computer. This technology could lead to the average soldier having superior shooting ability even without sharpshooter training. The computer determines the trajectory of the bullet before it’s fired making it almost trivial to land shots.

They also have the 6.8 LMG on the table but even fewer details have been given out about the MCX Spear’s sibling firearm. Sig Sauer claims that its new LMG platform weighs 40 percent less than its predecessors. Recoil is also said to be “dramatically” reduced in the new platform. The new LMG will also feature quick-detach magazines more M-LOK rail space the aforementioned suppressor and “vastly improves upon the operation and function of the legacy M249.”

The military will be selecting one of the three companies by October of 2021. After that the selected company will have a year to make rifles for the 2022 rollout. These rifles won’t be given out to all U.S. soldiers though. Special forces and recon are among the first to receive the rifles with the rest to receive them in the following years.

The parent company for The North Face Vans Supreme and Timberland brands will begin to fire all U.S. office-based employees on Jan. 31 if they have not been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. a company spokesperson confirmed to FN on Sunday.

In October VF said it was requiring all U.S. office-based employees to be fully vaccinated by Jan. 1. Those who have not been vaccinated by that date and do not have a religious or medical based accommodation will be terminated on Jan. 31.

“Given easy access to effective vaccines and our desire to resume more normal operations in our facilities in the US we issued a communication last October requiring all U.S. office-based VF associates to be fully vaccinated by January 1 2022” the spokesperson told FN in a statement. “We have pursued this new requirement in the most transparent way with our associates so that everyone has the opportunity to make plans that are right for them.”

The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Biden administration’s federal vaccine mandate in a 6-3 decision. If passed the rule would have required companies with more than 100 employees to mandate vaccinations or weekly tests across all staff. Even before the ruling various companies have announced their own vaccine requirements with some beginning to fire employees who do not comply.

Columbia Sportswear Co. and TJX Companies both recently said they will fire employees who do not receive the vaccine by a certain date. Nike is reported to have said similarly. Other companies including Under Armour Walmart and Saks Fifth Avenue are requiring vaccines among office staff as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fresh off a Top 25 effort in New York City Lawrence began his Windy City campaign with an eighth-place effort in Round 1 covering Street Fighter (C Check Bucking Bulls) for 86 points.

The Native American sensation was then unstoppable as Championship Saturday got underway.

Lawrence whose nickname is “The Firewalker” first brought the boisterous crowd to its feet when he won Round 2 via an 89.75-point ride aboard Bottom’s Up (TCB Ranch/K-C Bucking Bulls). The score allowed Lawrence to climb to second on the event leaderboard and garner the second pick in the championship round bull draft.

Lawrence opted to go head-to-head with Big Black (K-C Bucking Bulls/Joe & Nina Webb) the very bull aboard which Daylon Swearingen (Piffard New York) won the previous elite tour event in Chicago.

Lawrence remained poised as he climbed aboard the back of the renowned animal athlete. Matching Big Black jump-for-jump Lawrence clinched the second golden finish of his career when he reached the requisite 8 for an event-best 91 points.

The 90-point score was the fourth of Lawrence’s career on the premier series and first since February 2018.

In addition to winning the PBR Tractor Supply Co. Invitational Lawrence registered a fourth qualified ride in Chicago when he finished third in the accompanying 15/15 Bucking Battle covering Drago (Jeb Fredericks/Dakota Rodeo/Chad Berger) for 89.75 points.

Collectively Lawrence earned a check for $50625 along with a crucial 192 points. After beginning the event ranked No. 30 the North Dakota native rocketed 27 positions in the early 2022 PBR World Championship race to No. 3. Lawrence now trails the No. 1 rank by 106 points.

Joao Ricardo Vieira (Itatinga Brazil) left Chicago as the world’s new No. 1-ranked bull rider after finishing second in the main event and winning his PBR-best eighth 15/15 Bucking Battle.

The veteran rider’s perfect 4-for-4 effort earned him $26295 along with 154 points allowing him to leapfrog Kyler Oliver (Roy Utah) for the top position in the world standings now leading him by 24 points.

Vieira punched his ticket to the championship round of the PBR Tractor Supply Co. Invitational after riding Midnight Rain (Staci Wilks/N Bar Ranch/Clay Struve/Dakota Rodeo/Chad Berger) for 86.25 points in Round 1 and Ranch Water (Paradigm Bull Co./D’Anna & Lance Walker) for 87.25 points.

Vieira earned the silver finish after outmatching Cold Shot (Jeb Fredericks/Dakota Rodeo/Chad Berger) for 85.25 points in the final round.

Vieira was also sensational in the 15/15 Bucking Battle dominating the first special round of the season when he covered WSM’s Jive Turkey (WSM Auctioneers/Clay Struve/Dakota Rodeo/Chad Berger) for 91 points.

Thus far in 2022 Vieira has gone a perfect 7-for-7 with two of his rides marked 90 points or more. Should Vieira earn his first gold buckle at season’s end he would become the oldest PBR World Champion in history. Currently 37 Vieira would surpass Adriano Moraes (Cachoeira Paulista Brazil) who won his third title in 2006 at age 36.

While Oliver may have relinquished the world No. 1 rank he still showed up and showed out in Chicago. Despite being shut out in the main event Oliver finished second in the 15/15 Bucking Battle collecting 49 world points.

The runner-up effort was logged courtesy of his second 90-point ride of the season marked 90 points atop Diddy Wa Diddy (Cord McCoy/Bill McCarty).

Continuing his resurgent 2022 Cole Melancon (Sour Lake Texas) who began the season amidst a dismal 35-out ride streak was third.

Melancon was unchallenged through the opening rounds of action covering Short Stuff (C Check Bucking Bulls) for 88 points in Round 1 and WSM’s Trail of Tears (WSM Auctioneers/Clay Struve/Dakota Rodeo/Chad Berger) for 88.75 points in Round 2.

On the precipice of earning his second career Unleash The Beast victory Melancon’s hopes of victory were dashed in the championship round when he was bested by Homegrown (Cord McCoy/Chad Reese) in a quick 4.98 seconds.

Melancon left Allstate Arena with a check for $14092 along with a much-needed 72 world points allowing him to crack the world’s Top 10 in rising from No. 18 to No. 7. He now trails No. 1 Vieira by 208.84 points.

Manoelito de Souza Junior (Itamira Brazil) registered his second consecutive Top-10 finish in Chicago going 2-for-3 to conclude the tour stop fourth.

After covering God’s Plan (C Check Bucking Bulls) for 87 points in Round 1 Souza was upset in the second round when he was bested by Pico (Cord McCoy/Bruce Wold) in a swift 1.9 seconds.

In the championship round however Souza rebounded in dramatic fashion. Selecting the unridden Airborne (Paradigm Bull Co./Grayson Swalin) Souza became the first rider in 24 attempts across all levels of competition to cover the bovine athlete marked a career-best 89 points.

Souza’s latest Top-10 finish netted him $10103 and 56 world points. He gained three positions in the world standings climbing from No. 12 to No. 9.

Rounding out the Top 5 in fifth was Joao Henrique Lucas (Bastos Brazil) earning 48 world points.

Lucas bookended his outing in the Windy City with qualified rides covering The Hard Stuff (K-C Bucking Bulls/Bull Creek Bucking Bulls) for 86.25 points in Round 1 and Catfish (Viducic Bucking Bulls/Stetson Wright) for 88.25 points in the championship round.

In the bull pen High Brow Cat (Paradigm Bull Company) and Young Man’s Blues (Paradigm/Parker McCollum/Lockwood) tied for the YETI “Built for the Wild” Bull of The Event honor both marked 45.75 points. Bucking in the 15/15 Bucking Battle and championship round respectively High Brow Cat bucked off Austin Richardson (Dallas Texas) in 5.68 seconds while Young Man’s Blues dispatched Ezekiel Mitchell (Rockdale Texas) in 2.2 seconds.

This will reduce the carbon footprint of refrigerants used by its customers’ long-haul middle-mile and last-mile delivery fleets by nearly 50% or approximately 650000 metric tons of CO2e annually equivalent to the emissions of 143000 passenger vehicles per year.

While customers previously had the option to drop in the lower global warming potential refrigerant Thermo King units will now come standard with the industry’s most sustainable refrigerant available in the market today the company noted in a press release.

The next generation of Thermo King’s Precedent trailer portfolio will transition to the lower-GWP refrigerant (R452A) in January 2022 and truck products will come standard with the new refrigerant mid-2022. New units will no longer use R404A. These actions contribute to Trane Technologies’ Gigaton Challenge to reduce customer emissions by a billion metric tons by 2030.

Using a lower-GWP refrigerant as standard will help customers prepare for future regulation. Beginning in 2023 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) will require TRUs operating in California to use refrigerants with a GWP of 2200 or less. In North America Thermo King is one full year ahead of this regulation. As part of the global transition to more sustainable refrigerants Thermo King has been using R452A for its entire EMEA portfolio for several years and select products in North America and in Asia Pacific the company stated.",,,,,,,,,,,,

CBP said officers seized over 100 pounds in the last week of December from U.S. citizens returning from Liberia. The trend ""could have deadly effects and lead to another outbreak of disease"" a release said.

The passengers declared ""fish"" on their written and verbal declarations but upon further inspection officers found fish and bushmeat in the same package.

The Minnesota Department of Agriculture says bushmeat is raw or minimally processed meat which comes from wild animals such as monkeys cane rats bats and other nonhuman primates. The meat which is often smoked dried or salted poses a risk of human infection and the spread of Ebola virus.

Last week agriculture specialists stopped a passenger returning from Liberia and asked if he had any bushmeat. The passenger said he had ""parts of a monkey"" but it was ""two primate arms and primate rib material"" according to Area Port Director-Minnesota Augustine Moore.

The agriculture department says the fine for bringing bushmeat into the country is $250000. The confiscated bushmeat was destroyed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZkYS1leHRlbmRzLWV4cGlyYXRpb24tYWJib3R0LWF0LWhvbWUtY292aWQtdGVzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FDA extends expiration window for COVID-19 travel tests,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has increased the shelf life for one of the most popular at-home COVID-19 test kits. The agency announced that Abbott's BinaxNow COVID-19 Ag Card Home Test is now approved for a 15-month expiration window. This follows a request by the company to provide a longer shelf life for its test after it reported stability studies that showed the tests remained accurate and consistent over the longer time period. Here's the letter from the FDA to Abbott granting the extended expiration window.

This news should come as quite a relief for travelers overseas looking to get back to the United States. Depending on the original expiration date on the test this change can add up to six months to the shelf life.

The news was first reported by Kyle Potter at Thrifty Traveler.

The BinaxNow Home Test is very popular with international travelers. In fact the Abbot test the Ellume COVID-19 Home Test and Qured's video-supervised rapid antigen test are the only three at-home tests currently approved by the CDC to be used by inbound passengers to the U.S. The CDC guidelines require all travelers regardless of vaccination status to show a negative COVID-19 test result before boarding a plane to the U.S.

(TPG reported last summer that the wait times for BinaxNow supervised exams through Zoom were quite long due to high demand but wait times have improved.)

What was not so convenient about the tests is that many people ordered them and discovered that they expired too quickly to be used. Many tests were being shipped to customers with expiration dates that were only six to nine months out from their initial production date. That doesn't do much good for travelers with trips planned several months down the road.

The FDA's extension now provides a 15-month window from the production date of the tests. The expiration date was previously 12 months. You can find the expiration date on the front of your BinaxNow home test.

We've written before about inaccurate expiration dates and other issues with these at-home tests but the bottom line is they are incredibly helpful if you're planning to travel overseas. They make the process of obtaining the required negative COVID test result much less of a hassle. Now you also have more time to use the test.

It was the Augusta County couple’s life savings.

The money was supposed to float them as they got a relatively new small business off the ground. But by noon that day their account was empty. An unidentified scammer drained it in three wire transactions only minutes apart.

BBT (which is merging with SunTrust to form a larger bank Truist) wrote the couple a cashier’s check for $55634.91 as reimbursement. They deposited that into another bank Jan. 4.

But by Jan. 7 that account was empty too. BBT/Truist canceled the check and clawed back the money.

Now Shannon Waszak said she and her husband can’t afford groceries. They’re contemplating selling their home — which they painstakingly spent four years renovating — and using its equity to keep going the small business they opened in August.

Truist has very little at all to say about this story.

“We at Truist are very concerned that a client may have been a victim of fraud as our clients’ financial security is of paramount importance to us” said David White a Truist spokesman.

“To protect the privacy of our clients and because this is an ongoing investigation we can’t provide any other specifics. But let me assure you that our team is reaching out to the client and we are working diligently and aggressively to determine what happened and resolve this matter.”

Events leading up to this unhappy event began early on the morning of Jan. 3. But before we start there let me tell you just a bit about the Waszaks.

For more than a decade Christopher Waszak 38 chased hail storms around the country performing paintless dent repair. In 2016 the couple purchased a 3400-square-foot house in Deerfield a rural community north and west of Staunton. The house stood on 55 acres and it needed a lot of work.

The Waszaks spent weekends over the next four years renovating — they didn’t move into until 2020. Then last August they opened a storefront paintless dent repair business in Staunton.

They hoped Christian could earn money in his trade without spending months every year on the road. And while they got that business going the Waszaks intended to survive on savings.

Then at 1:27 a.m. Jan. 3 Shannon 43 received a text on her smartphone. It appeared to be from Truist Customer Service. And it asked Shannon about a $436.16 transaction on Amazon Marketplace. The Waszaks had made no such purchase.

The text instructed her to reply with the number 1 if the transaction was legitimate or the number 2 if it was not. Shannon replied 2. And she received a second text informing her Truist would be in touch. Then she went back to sleep.

At 9:32 a.m. Shannon said she called Truist’s toll-free customer service number three times. On each call she was unable to make it past the automated prompts she said. So instead she called the local branch in Staunton. Shannon told a bank rep there of the texts and inquired about any problems with the account.

The Truist branch employee told her the account showed neither a pending Amazon charge nor any usual activity.

While on that call Shannon’s smartphone Caller ID notified her she’d missed two incoming calls ostensibly from Truist’s toll free customer-service number. When that same number rang Shannon’s phone a third time (while she was still on the phone with the branch) she ended the branch call and took the incoming one.

It was from a man who identified himself as from Truist. He told Shannon there had been attempts to access their account. And that he could help them. The first order of business the caller said was to change their password so they would have access to the account while the bank investigated the fraud attempt.

The man asked for their email address and the last four digits of their taxpayer identification number (it’s similar to a Social Security number). That didn’t trouble Shannon because she said Truist had requested the latter number in the past when Shannon had called the bank.

The caller also told Shannon she would be receiving some text notifications from Truist containing certain codes. He instructed her to read those code numbers to him.

She did during a phone call that lasted an hour and 10 minutes. During that phone call Shannon said Christopher independently called the Staunton BBT/Truist branch to ensure branch personnel knew the Waszaks were talking to Truist Customer Service.

To Christopher the branch employee verified Truist’s toll-free customer-service number. It was the same number Shannon was still on the line with. That was at 10:42 a.m.

At 11:53 a.m. the Truist branch called Christopher because an employee had noticed suspicious activity on his account. In fact by then it had been nearly emptied in three wire transactions. The first happened at 11:37 a.m. and the last one was at 11:51. And the Waszaks were out $55634.91.

To shorten an already long story the guy who called Shannon from “Truist Customer Service” was a scammer. He had “smished” (or forged) the initial Jan. 3 texts to Shannon’s phone at 1:27 a.m. to make it appear as if it was from Truist. Later when he called Shannon he “spoofed” the Truist telephone number to make the call seem legit on Caller ID.

The Waszaks spent most of the rest of Jan. 3 day talking to actual Truist employees. They also reported the theft to the FBI and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The next day Jan. 4 Shannon went to the BBT/Truist branch in Staunton. A female employee told Shannon she had “good news.” The bank would reimburse the Waszaks’ scammed funds with a cashier’s check.

Christopher the primary account holder picked up the check for $55634.91 that day and deposited it at Summit Bank in Churchville.

On Jan. 5 just after 5 p.m. Shannon got a call from the BBT/Truist branch manager in Staunton. According to Shannon he said the bank should not have issued the check and the Waszaks should not have been able to move the money out of Truist because of the ongoing investigation. He asked them to return it.

The Waszaks declined. And this past Friday the $55634.91 disappeared from their Summit account too. Shannon said that was because Truist “canceled” the cashier’s check it had issued three days earlier.

Julie Wheeler president of the Better Business Bureau of Western Virginia sounded aghast after I described this series of events. Wheeler called it a “next-level” confidence game.

“These phone scams and text scams are horrible” Wheeler said.

Based on years of experience examining thousands of scams Wheeler told me what likely happened.

The very first text Wheeler said was most likely sent to every number in the area code for Shannon’s phone (it was not 540). By responding Shannon unknowingly identified herself as a Truist customer.

And because of the second text she was already expecting a call from Truist.

Later the morning the texted “codes” sent to Shannon shortly were actually from Truist Customer Service. Those were legitimate two-factor authentication efforts. Banks and online businesses often send those whenever anyone tries to access a customer account from an unfamiliar computer.

That’s because while the scammer was on the phone with Shannon Jan. 3 posing as a Truist rep he was attempting to access the Waszaks’ account. And as he did that the bank sent Shannon the two-factor authentication texts for security purposes. After he persuaded Shannon to disclose those codes he gained complete access to the Waszaks’ account which he promptly raided.

Shannon said the bank informed her the wire transfers went to Well Fargo and TD Bank. Wheeler said they were likely transferred into other accounts at other banks within minutes so they could not be clawed back.

Because Shannon supplied those authentication codes to the scammer “I’m concerned [for the Waszaks] because they were somewhat complicit in the scam being able to take place” Wheeler said.

It’s possible the bank could refuse a refund based on that.

“We tried to call the bank” Shannon said. In fact Christopher was on the phone with the Truist branch at the same time Shannon was talking to the scammer. And until 11:53 a.m. Monday the bank told the couple it saw no problems with their account.

“They can argue all day long that my stupidity caused this” Shannon said. “We were on the phone within 30 minutes (before their money was gone) to stop all that.”

So the couple is out a lot of money. It’s unclear what Truist is going to do about the fraud. Shannon said they haven’t heard from the bank since I brought the issue to Truist executives’ attention. That was this past Monday.

The Waszaks may have to sell their home to keep their business going Shannon said. On Jan. 8 a real estate agent toured the house to consider it as a potential listing. Last week they also consulted a lawyer in Northern Virginia who specializes in representing consumers.

One of the stranger aspects to this saga is the (later canceled) cashier’s check Truist issued the Waszaks for $55634.91. Why did the bank issue it and why did they claw the money back? That’s a question to which I still haven’t gotten an answer.

Wheeler said the Federal Trade Commission tracked more than half-a-million imposter scams in 2020. About 31% were accomplished by phone imposters and 27% were by text. The total losses from text scams alone that year was $86 million she said. The median loss in those texting scams was about $800.

“If you get a phone call or text message from your bank claiming your account has been compromised hang up and call back. Find your bank’s phone number online or on a statement to ensure you’re calling the bank and not a scammer” Wheeler said.

The Waszaks tried that. Unfortunately it did little good.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzZnJlZXByZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvamFuLzE1L3ZhdWdobi1uYW1lZC1jaGF0dGFub29nYXJlbWFuYWdlci15ZWFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jim Vaughn named Chattanooga Area Manager of the Year,"Every year for the past 36 years a group of Chattanooga management professionals recognizes a community leader as the Chattanooga Area Manager of the Year.

When the group recently visited Truist Bank Market President Jim ""JV"" Vaughn to tell him he had won the annual honor this year the normally talkative 67-year-old banker was temporarily speechless.

""I was stunned and appreciative at the same time but to be candid I was shocked because I really thought this group had come to ask me for money"" Vaughn recalled during an interview last week in his 11th-story bank office.

MIT undergraduates are using labs at MIT.nano to tinker at the nanoscale exploring spectrometry nanomaterial synthesis photovoltaics sensor fabrication and other topics. They’re also getting an experience not common at the undergraduate level — gowning up in a bunny suit and performing hands-on research inside a clean room.

During the fall 2021 semester these students were part of 6.S059 (Nanotechnology — Design From Atoms to Everything) and 6.A06 (First.nano! – Fabricate Your Own Solar Cell in MIT.nano Cleanroom) two classes offered by the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) aimed at introducing undergraduates to nanoscience through design-focused learning utilizing relevant fabrication processes and tool sets.

“Classes like these can be transformational experiences for our students” says MIT.nano Director Vladimir Bulovic the Fariborz Maseeh (1990) Chair in Emerging Technology. “They spread the message that nanoscience is at your fingertips. It’s not some far-off abstract concept but accessible here and now. We are thrilled to see MIT faculty inspiring and shaping the future leaders of science and technology by showing them what they can master inside MIT.nano.”

Using simple tools to encourage broad exploration

Class 6.S059 was developed to bridge the fundamentals of engineering design with the actual building of functional integrated technologies something typically separated into multiple classes and semesters.

Over nine weeks 18 students from five different academic departments learned several nanoscale prototyping techniques in MIT.nano including spin coating maskless lithography 3D printing colloidal synthesis sputtering evaporation and optical microscopy. By focusing on a variety of simple tools the students could do much of the work without needing extensive specialized training. Rather than watching teaching assistants run equipment these undergraduates could do the research themselves and in the process focus on how the science works as opposed to how to operate a complicated setup.

“We wanted to teach the science of what you need to design nanodevices and systems in an interactive and hands-on way” says co-instructor Farnaz Niroui the EE Landsman (1958) Career Development Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. “Often these introductory courses take on a heavy mathematical/theoretical approach which can make it hard to maintain students’ interest. We decided to teach it through an applied approach — having the students design and build while learning the fundamentals along the way.”

Instead of giving instructions on how to do each step in weekly labs Niroui and co-instructor Rajeev Ram professor of electrical engineering taught the end result (such as using light to observe things you cannot see with the naked eye) and then let the students experiment with assembling the tool set needed to get there (such as designing and building their own microscopes and handheld spectrometers). Each week’s project built on the one before. For example the undergraduates first designed their own spectrometers then fabricated the optical grating and a 3D printed case to assemble the tool. This led to a hands-on introduction to CAD design photolithography and 3D printing followed by playing with different light sources and testing their devices on real-world applications by measuring the chlorophyll in a leaf and the emission of quantum dots.

For their final project the students divided into teams to design and build their own functioning devices. Each project had to use materials and techniques covered in the class and have at least one feature smaller than 100 nanometers. All six teams were ultimately successful overcoming challenges to create stretchable sensors using silver nanowires seven-segment pixelated displays for wearable applications a programmable organic light-emitting diode matrix light-trapping microstructures for thin-film solar cells color-tunable light-emitting diode and printing fluorescent ink on flexible substrates.

“Seeing the students design and build their own devices after only a few weeks of instruction was exciting and impressive” says Ram. “It showed that hands-on introduction to advanced concepts in physics can really provide undergraduates with useful working knowledge about nanotechnology.”

This was the first year for the design-focused nanotechnology class. Niroui and Ram hope to scale it up in future semesters expanding the offering to more undergraduates.

“Many of the students have said they are excited to explore further into the world of applied science and hardware engineering” says teaching assistant Mayuran Saravanapavanantham a PhD candidate in EECS. “One even said they searched MIT’s course listings for anything with the term ‘nano’.” Saravanapavanantham was one of three TAs for 6.S059 along with Roberto Brenes and Peter Satterthwaite all EECS doctoral students.

An early glimpse into the nanoworld

“First.nano!” an advising seminar for first-year students had similar goals: showing undergraduates what’s possible at the nanoscale through hands-on clean-room experiences. For three hours each week MIT students in 6.A06 explored MIT.nano’s facilities experimenting with nanotechnology tool sets and building silicon solar cells under the guidance of co-instructors Jesús del Alamo the Donner Professor of Engineering and Jorg Scholvin the MIT.nano assistant director for user services.

“How do we get first-year students interested in nanofabrication?” asks Jorg Scholvin. “Bring them into the clean room and let them learn by doing things in the lab.” The strategy definitely sparked interest: More than 30 incoming undergraduates applied to fill one of the eight slots offered in the seminar.

Students don’t typically enter the clean room during their undergraduate studies says Scholvin. By introducing them to nanofabrication in their first semester del Alamo and Scholvin hope to accelerate their paths into nano-related fields. And with experience working in a particle-free environment Scholvin says these students are now prepared for future opportunities such as conducting nanoscale research with faculty through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program.

“One of the goals of First.nano! was to share our passion for nanofabrication” says del Alamo. “MIT.nano is an extraordinary facility. By creating opportunities for these students to work and study here we hope to open it up to broad use for undergraduate research and education.”

Undergraduates from both 6.S059 and 6.A06 are invited to present their work at the Microsystems Annual Research Conference (MARC) co-sponsored by MIT.nano and the Microsystems Technology Laboratories in January. The event which brings together over 200 students faculty and industry partners to celebrate scientific advances in nanotechnology traditionally features presentations by graduate-level students.",,,,,,,,,

I continued to follow reporting that described the long-standing injustices faced by meatpacking workers many of whom are refugees from around the world. While my friends were perplexed by my sudden fascination with meatpacking I knew that as a social justice oriented Catholic this was not a topic I could ignore.

Meatpacking America: How migration work and faith unite and divide the Heartland Kristy Nabhan-Warren 280 pages; University of North Carolina Press; 2021

The lives and stories of these workers are at the heart of Meatpacking America: How Migration Work and Faith Unite and Divide the Heartland. Kristy Nabhan-Warren an anthropologist of religion and migration draws on eight years of research in rural meatpacking towns of Iowa. A skilled ethnographer she brings the reader into rural Midwestern homes workspaces and churches — intimate places that provide a fuller picture of the story of meatpacking. Meatpacking workers labor in one of the country’s most dangerous jobs. Killing cutting and packaging hogs chicken and cattle is physically demanding and psychologically taxing. But the protein industry usually hides this from public view. Many stories in Meatpacking America show the precarity of refugees’ lives. Mugombekere ""James"" Mugereke and his family escaped violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo only to find their family in a tent camp in Zimbabwe where malnutrition was prevalent and clean water was scarce. After being granted refugee status by the U.S. government James and his family were placed in a Catholic Charities resettlement program that allowed them to join relatives in Iowa. Working as a shift supervisor and translator at Iowa Premium Beef offered James steady employment and the possibility to build a life for his family in the U.S.

James is one of thousands of refugees who find work in the Corn Belt. Since the 1980s refugees from Mexico the Democratic Republic of Congo Syria Somalia Sudan Honduras Guatemala Myanmar and Vietnam have come to the Midwest seeking jobs and an affordable cost of living. They find it on corporate farms and large-scale meatpacking plants where immigrant labor has long been exploited in an industry that has discouraged unions and low-paying wages in right-to-work states like Iowa. Although there are ample jobs workers pay a high price for this employment especially in regard to their health and well-being. In reading these stories both in the last two years and in this book I find myself increasingly heartbroken by the structures of capitalism and global consumer demand that trap the most vulnerable in low-paying dangerous jobs. Why are these the jobs available to global refugees escaping the world's most horrific conditions? How can justice for migrants and refugees be achieved within an exploitative system? Meatpacking America shows that the communities surrounding meatpacking plants are important places to learn about the complex intersections of work and survival migration and belonging race and religion. Weaving together stories of hope and loss Nabhan-Warren illuminates the motivations and dreams of Latino African and Asian migrants and refugees as well as white Iowans. Each chapter offers readers deeper insight into how all who make rural Iowa their home employ understandings of work family and religion to make sense of their histories and their relationships within a multiethnic multilingual community. The workplaces and worship spaces of these refugees also reveal that they cannot escape whiteness. From the upper management of meatpacking companies to the hog and cattle farmers of the producer class white Iowans hold positions of power and privilege. White CEOs of Tyson Foods use religious language to sanitize the violence of the workplace. The company markets itself as committed to ""integrity"" ""faith"" and ""values."" ""While the CEOs CFOs and human resources management at the meatpacking plants want to downplay the blood and violence and even sacralize it"" Nabhan-Warren writes ""the killing and cutting floors are not experienced as a religious space by the workers."" Upper management brands meatpacking as sacred but this is not how workers describe their experiences. The combination of corporate power and whiteness enables CEOs to valorize meatpacking work obscuring the lived realities of Black and brown refugees.

Covid-19? Listeria? Salmonella? E. coli?,"What’s on the menu for 2022? Covid-19? Listeria? Salmonella? E. coli?

The year 2021 was a long year not just for Covid-19 but also for listeria outbreaks in the US. Haskell and DeAngelo review the regulations currently in place to help control listeria outbreaks.

Kris DeAngelo is an attorney and teaches several courses with MSU's Institute for Food Laws and Regulations. Scott Haskell teaches the online course “Global Animal Health Food Safety and International Trade” each fall semester and ""The Law of the Preventive Controls for Human Food Rule"" each spring semester.

The year 2021 was a long year not just for Covid-19 but also for listeria outbreaks in the US. Here are some of the recalls and FDA/CDC investigations that took place in the latter part of 2021 alone:

So what has happened to cause this increase in listeria outbreaks in 2021? Is Covid-19 not enough? And what’s on the menu for 2022?

First let’s look at the disease agent. Listeria is a Gram-positive facultatively intracellular rod-shaped bacteria that is environmentally ubiquitous; it can grow aerobically (with oxygen) or anaerobically (without oxygen) and is generally considered an opportunistic pathogen. It grows well at a range of temperatures from -1.5 to 45 degrees C (29.3-113 degrees F) a pH range of 4.0-9.6 and diverse humidity ranges and even high salt concentrations of 25%. It even makes a lovely biofilm (think slimely lunchmeat!); and Listeria sp. are omnipresent in nature; commonly found in water animal intestines and feces soil leafy vegetables raw as well as treated sewage effluent disposed from meat processing facilities improperly treated silage and decomposing produce like soybeans and corn.

This ubiquitous nature of listeria means that many common foods can be sources of listeria infection including raw vegetables cooked and raw meats fermented raw-meat sausages improperly pasteurized milk cheeses (especially soft-ripened types including ricotta Camembert and traditional Mexican cheeses) ice cream and cooked ready-to-eat (RTE) meats cooked crustaceans smoked finfish and smoked shellfish raw seafood and non-acidic fruit (such as melon watermelon and papaya). It has even been found in frozen beef products.

How does it get in these foods? From nature. Because when listeria isn’t running amuck in humans and animals it’s a soil decomposing bacterium munching on all types of rotting vegetation in the soil. It’s growing right where the food is! Then a little rain or irrigation on growing crops causes water dirt bacteria to splash up on the low growing produce or maybe it ends up on the udders or hides or in the intestines of farm animals and voila! It’s hard to detect hard to control and can result in intermittent contamination of food. And consuming listeria containing food can make you sick.

Listeriosis is a serious infection in both humans as well as animals and is most commonly caused by the organism Listeria monocytogenes. Of the seventeen species of listeria only L. monocytogenes a few types of L. innocua and L. ivanovii cause foodborne disease in humans with L. monocytogenes (Lm) being the most common. Any infection caused by listeria is called listeriosis.

Listeriosis is a relatively rare foodborne disease (in the US ~1600 cases per year). But it is a serious disease with ~94% hospitalization rates (US ~1500) and high fatality rates (approaching 20%-30% depending on location.) The incubation period is long 17-67 days making it more difficult to diagnosis. The disease primarily affects older adults pregnant women those with weakened immune systems and newborns causing gastroenteritis vomiting joint pain headaches. More seriously in pregnant women Lm causes miscarriage stillbirth premature birth life threatening infections in the newborn and in non-pregnant persons encephalitis meningitis and blood infections.

Listeria is considered a pathogen of significant public health concern. The overall cost estimates for Listeria infections in the US are thought to be from $228 million to $7.6 billion yearly. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Center for Zoonotic Vector-Borne and Enteric Diseases listeriosis was added to the list of nationally notifiable diseases in 2001.

So what has been done? Not much. Despite an FDA “Action Plan” in 2008 much of that list remains in the discussion stage despite 24 major outbreaks since 2011 alone including a serious listeria outbreak linked to whole cantaloupes from Jensen Farms in 2011 in which 30 people died.

At least for ready-to-eat (RTE) refrigerated or frozen foods FDA issued the “Listeria Rule” which requires various steps to be taken to prevent contamination. And while FDA has the authority under FSMA to mandate a recall if a company refuses to issue its own USDA FSIS does not have mandatory recall authority over meat poultry or processed egg products that contain listeria (or other food safety issues). But USDA can only issue “public health alerts.” This is not enough.

Similarly for fresh-cut produce in 2007 FDA issued draft guidance which almost 15 years later is still just a draft with no teeth.

Moreover various studies have been done in cooperation with Michigan State University University of Florida and Florida A&M and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). These remain important information guiding plans that have not been approved.

It’s almost 2022. Come on FDA and USDA let’s get Listeria off the plate.

During the years 2014 to 2018 51 foodborne disease outbreaks linked to leafy greens (mainly lettuce) were reported to CDC. Five were multistate outbreaks that led the CDC to issue warnings to the public. Among those two outbreaks were linked to packaged salads and two were linked to romaine lettuce.

What are the laws and regulations that are in place to help control listeria in food?

The extreme danger associated with the risk of Listeria in RTE products has prompted the USDA to declare the bacteria an adulterant with FSIS Directive 10240.4.

The USDA maintains a zero-tolerance policy for the presence of this deadly pathogen in food. The Code of Federal Regulations includes requirements for the post-lethality control of Listeria in meat and poultry products. This regulation enacted in 2003 is commonly called “The Listeria Rule” (9 CFR § 430.4). The rule outlines the control and prevention that must be undertaken in processing facilities to reduce the risk of contamination of RTE products. According to 21 CFR 117.3 a RTE food means any food that is normally eaten in its raw state or any other food including a processed food for which it is reasonably foreseeable that the food will be eaten without further processing that would significantly minimize biological hazards.

9 CFR § 430.4 “Control of Listeria monocytogenes in post-lethality exposed ready-to-eat products” is the primary legislation to help prevent foodborne infections. FDA may regard a RTE food that supports growth of L. monocytogenes to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act; the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1)) when L. monocytogenes is present in the food based on the detection method indicated in section IV.A.

Let’s look at § 430.4 “Control of Listeria monocytogenes in post-lethality exposed ready-to-eat products” and evaluate how it is to be utilized by the industry:

“L. monocytogenes is a hazard that an establishment producing post-lethality exposed RTE products must control through its HACCP plan or prevent in the processing environment through a Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program. RTE product is adulterated if it contains L. monocytogenes or if it comes into direct contact with a food contact surface that is contaminated with L. monocytogenes. Establishments must not release into commerce product that contains L. monocytogenes or that has been in contact with a food contact surface contaminated with L. monocytogenes without first reworking the product using a process that is destructive of L. monocytogenes.” (Code of Federal Regulations)

“In order to maintain the sanitary conditions necessary to meet this requirement an establishment producing post-lethality exposed RTE product must comply with the requirements included in one of the three following alternatives:

Alternative 1 . Use of a post-lethality treatment (which may be an antimicrobial agent) that reduces or eliminates microorganisms on the product and an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits the growth of monocytogenes.

Use of a post-lethality treatment (which may be an antimicrobial agent) that reduces or eliminates microorganisms on the product and an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits the growth of monocytogenes. Alternative 2.Use of either a post-lethality treatment (which may be an antimicrobial agent) that reduces or eliminates microorganisms on the product or an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits growth of monocytogenes.

Alternative 3.Use of sanitation measures only.

The establishment must verify that the corrective actions that it takes with respect to sanitation after an initial positive test for L. monocytogenes or an indicator organism on a food contact surface in the post-lethality processing environment are effective by conducting follow-up testing that includes a targeted test of the specific site on the food contact surface area that is the most likely source of contamination by the organism and such additional tests in the surrounding food contact surface area as are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the corrective actions.

Sanitation measures for controlling L. monocytogenes and procedures for antimicrobial agents or processes that suppress or limit the growth of the pathogen may be incorporated either in the establishment's HACCP plan or in its Sanitation SOP or other prerequisite program. When these control procedures are incorporated into the Sanitation SOP or prerequisite program and not as a CCP in the HACCP plan the establishment must have documentation that supports the decision in its hazard analysis that L. monocytogenes is not a hazard that is reasonably likely to occur.

If the measures for addressing L. monocytogenes are addressed in a prerequisite program other than the Sanitation SOP the establishment must include the program and the results produced by the program in the documentation that the establishment is required to maintain under 9 CFR 417.5.” (Code of Federal Regulations)

Foodborne illness source determination is an important process for estimating food categories that are associated with specific pathogens. As we can see from 2021 listeria is a diverse pathogen associated with a multitude of food sources and environmental outbreaks. Epidemiological studies of disease outbreaks now demonstrate that listeria can cause gastroenteritis in the absence of invasive disease and associated mortality. The determination of multiple data sources is necessary to make attribution estimates.

Determining the many sources of foodborne illness is a key step in identifying opportunities to improve our domestic food safety.

It is important to emphasize that maintaining an improved understanding of the relationship between contaminated foods and disease helps maintain food safety from farm to fork. Continuing listeria research and improving the laws and regulations is an important step in this control and prevention process.

With the U.S. Supreme Court blocking the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for private companies employers now face a patchwork of state rules on COVID-19 workplace safety.

Different and sometimes confusing vaccine rules now apply across the economy based on the city sector funding source and corporate policy.

“There isn’t a right answer for employers at this point” said Shannon Farmer an attorney at Ballard Spahr in Philadelphia.

She said the U.S. Supreme Court’s action on Thursday to freeze the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s vaccine-or-test mandates could pit a company’s human relations staffers who want to protect the health of employees against operating executives who worry how internal vaccine mandates could cause employees to quit.

John S. Ho co-chair of OSHA-Workplace Safety Practice at Cozen O’Connor said that companies can “essentially ignore” the Biden vaccine mandate though the issue will be litigated in the lower federal courts. “It’s not over yet but employers don’t have to worry about it. So folks are left with different state and city rules.”

On Friday Mayor Jim Kenney’s administration set a Jan. 24 date for implementing a vaccination mandate for city workers after reaching a deal with one of the city’s unions. The city has 22000 unionized employees and they will be required to show proof of vaccination or obtain an exemption for religious or medical reasons.

Some Philly-area employers such as Amtrak and WSFS Bank the largest bank based in the Philadelphia area had already implemented vaccine-or-testing rules similar to the OSHA standard that the court has now suspended.

National employers including American Express BlackRock General Electric Google MGM International Comcast’s NBC Universal and Southwest Airlines are requiring vaccines for workers at their locations according to a list compiled by NBC News.

CVS and McDonald’s are requiring higher-paid office and professional staff but not hourly-paid retail workers to get the shots.

American Airlines one of the largest private employers in Philadelphia said on Friday that it was subject to a totally different mandate one for federal contractors.

“We shared last week that more than 96% of our team members have submitted proof of vaccination or a request for an accommodation. This is great news and we continue to see submissions every day” a spokesperson said in an email on Friday.

But Farmer the Ballard Spahr attorney said that in a separate and earlier decision the courts had stayed or frozen the mandates for federal contractors as it did on Thursday for the OSHA vaccine mandate.

The Supreme Court’s ruling

In its ruling the Supreme Court said that the Biden administration and OSHA had exceeded their authority in an attempt “to regulate public health more broadly” than Congress had authorized.

The justices however let stand a separate vaccine mandate covering 10 million health-care workers who treat patients in the federally funded Medicare and Medicaid programs.

The vote in the vaccine mandate case was 6 to 3 with the liberal justices in opposition. The health care case split was 5 to 4 with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh joining the liberal justices.

The court majority explained the distinction it drew this way: COVID–19 is not an occupational hazard as it spreads at home in schools at sports games and where people get together. As such OSHA the federal workplace safety agency is not authorized under federal law to protect broadly against it.

But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has a responsibility to protect the patients at facilities funded by federal health dollars and can enact regulations to ensure patient safety such as vaccinations for nurses and doctors against COVID-19.

“The key issue in both cases was neither whether vaccine mandates are beneficial nor whether people have a right to refuse them. Rather the issue was whether Congress had given the agencies the power to impose the mandates” said Michael R. Dimino law professor at Widener University Commonwealth Law School.

Business lobbyists had complained about the cost of the measure which would affect over 80 million workers including 1.8 million in the Philly area at firms employing 100 or more workers.

In applauding the decision Leslie Sarasin president of the Food Marketing Institute one of 10 employer groups that sued to block the requirement said that the food sector would find itself grappling with an even more acute worker shortage on top of the other economic distortions brought on by the health crisis.

The high court “recognized the challenges the federal rule would have imposed on food retailers and manufacturers our employees and ultimately American consumers” Sarasin said.

Suspending federal enforcement “will help ensure the food industry is able to continue meeting our customers’ needs as efficiently and effectively as possible amid the ongoing supply chain and labor disruptions” Sarasin added in a statement.

A local labor leader disagreed. “It would have been really good if the [OSHA policy] had been put into effect with everybody following the same standard” said Wendell Young IV head of UFCW Local 1776 which represents 35000 supermarket pharmacy and food factory workers in Pennsylvania and a few neighboring areas.

The OSHA requirement set a national standard that took pressure off individual employers to do the right thing even when it was unpopular he added.

Young said some big employers have been planning in the absence of a federal rule to step up vaccination and testing requirements and to pay sick employees to stay home under quarantine rather than risk sickening more workers.

He cited Tyson Foods and JBS the meatpacking giant among the large employers who had agreed to encourage vaccination and testing even before the Biden policy was announced last year.

Young said 90% of workers at the JBS plant in Souderton were vaccinated after the death of a union shop steward Enock Benjamin early in the pandemic — a higher level than in surrounding affluent Montgomery County.

“In the more rural areas some employees aren’t taking it as seriously as well as some of our members” Young admitted. “But they are taking it seriously where they see the impact on management’s ability to run the plant” as sick workers called out. Young said management at the Cargill and Hershey plants in Hazle Township Luzerne County among others are negotiating tougher anti-virus rules.

Mike Lindell claims two of his financial backers want him to ""leave their bank.""

The MyPillow CEO shared recordings of a phone call with a bank representative to Insider.

He also told Insider that they would have to ""throw him out"" and he won't close out voluntarily.

Mike Lindell the founder and CEO of MyPillow told Insider on Friday that he's been told by two financial institutions to ""leave their bank.""

Lindell said Minnesota Bank & Trust and Heartland Financial USA told him they no longer wanted to do business with him.

Lindell is one of the most vocal supporters of former President Donald Trump; he recently told Insider he's already spent $25 million pushing Trump's baseless voter fraud claims.

Earlier this month the January 6 House Select Committee subpoenaed the pillow CEO's phone records over his ties to the former president.

According to Lindell this raised concerns at Minnesota Bank & Trust.

""But what if somebody came in and said 'you know what we're gonna subpoena all of his account records and this and that' and we make the news?"" a man Lindell identified as Tom Cardle a senior vice president at Minnesota Bank & Trust said in recordings obtained by Insider.

Cardle also referred to the bank's continued relationship with Lindell as a ""reputation risk.""

Cardle didn't respond to Insider's multiple requests for comment on whether he was in the recordings. However Insider independently verified that the phone number was linked to an office line associated with Cardle.

""What happens with accounts is between bankers and their clients. Decisions about bank accounts will be left to the account holders"" a Minnesota Bank & Trust representative told Insider when reached for comment on Friday.

""These guys have an agenda there's something wrong or they would have done something before"" Lindell told Insider on Friday responding to the call. ""They would have done something last year or a year ago. Like on January 9 when I was at the White House running around with papers from a lawyer that said 'martial law' they would have done this.""

Lindell was actually photographed at the White House carrying notes about martial law on January 15.

""Why did they wait till now?"" he continued. ""There's something behind this and we can't let everyone get de-banked in our country.""







Lindell added that he thought the banks wanting to terminate their relationship with him was about the ""First Amendment"" floating a theory that ""somebody got to them.""

""[The banks] never had a problem with the cyber symposium. They didn't have a problem last year when all the box stores canceled me"" Lindell said referring to his 72-hour cyber symposium in Sioux Falls South Dakota and Costco and other retailers pulling MyPillow products from their shelves. ""Isn't this weird? You know give me a break. These guys are disgusting.""

The pillow executive said he does not intend to comply with the bank's entreaties for him to close the accounts.

""I'm not closing my accounts. They're going to have to throw me out"" Lindell told Insider adding that he thought the banks were taking these actions because of ""cancel culture.""

What about inflation? How fast could interest rates rise?

But Powell who is seeking his second term also confronted a question that underscored the profound changes that could be ahead for both the economy and the powerful financial institution he leads: How does the Fed plan to address the economic risks posed by climate change?

Around the world central bankers have begun to factor such risks into their decision-making process aimed at maintaining the safety and stability of their economies. In 2019 the Swedish Central Bank sold off bonds it held in the Canadian province of Alberta and parts of Australia citing the risk posed by the economies’ high greenhouse gas emissions. The central banks of China India South Korea and New Zealand have sought to increase their purchases of “green” bonds. Last year the Bank of France announced it would end investments in coal and reduce its oil and gas holdings by 2024. And the Bank of England last year embarked on its first comprehensive “stress test” of the British financial system’s ability to manage climate change and the transition to a net-zero economy with publication of the results expected in May.

But the U.S. Federal Reserve under Powell who took over as chairman in 2018 after being tapped by President Donald Trump has done little beyond acknowledging the risks of climate change and studying its role. In a report card last year progressive environmental groups led by Oil Change International concluded that the Federal Reserve arguably the most powerful central bank in the world had done less on climate than any other major central bank.

“Our role on climate change is a limited one but it’s an important one” Powell said at last Tuesday’s Senate Banking Committee hearing. “It is to ensure that the banking institutions that we regulate understand their risks and can manage them.”

President Joe Biden facing pressure from progressives expressed confidence that Powell would act on climate in November when nominating him to serve a second four-year term. “He’s made clear to me a top priority will be to accelerate the Fed’s effort to address and mitigate the risks… that climate change poses to our financial system and our economy” Biden said.

But several Democratic Senators remain unconvinced. “The world is running out of time to deal with the climate crisis and the Fed has an important role to play here and I hope the Fed will step up” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) after grilling Powell during his confirmation hearing. She has called Powell “dangerous” and has vowed to oppose his confirmation.

Powell a Republican and former Wall Street banker who was originally appointed to the Fed in 2012 by President Barack Obama is expected to have enough bipartisan support to win confirmation. And with pressure building domestically and internationally for financial regulators to take a more active role in addressing climate change Powell almost certainly will be the federal reserve chairman who sets the institution’s course in a critical decade for the drive to a net-zero carbon economy.

For Ever-Evolving Fed Climate is a New Challenge

When the Federal Reserve was established more than a century ago its primary purpose was to maintain the safety and soundness of the then-shaky American banking system. But over the years its role has expanded and evolved to encompass shepherding the economy as a whole.

During the Great Depression Congress gave the Fed more power to control the quantity of money available in the economy. The reserve later played a crucial role in financing military spending by the United States and its allies in World War II. In the late 1970s after oil shocks rocked the global economy the Fed finally (and many experts think belatedly) stepped in with high interest rates to curb double-digit inflation. After the stock market crash of 1987 and the terrorist attacks of 2001 the Fed injected money into the economy and set low interest rates to spur recovery.

“The President has very little effect on the economy” Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Fogel said in 2004. “If you want to put blame or credit the main person who influences the business cycle is the Head of the Federal Reserve Bank.”

The economic collapse of 2008 was a turning point that led to even more responsibilities for the Fed and for central bankers around the world. They couldn’t stabilize the economy with low interest rates alone; the rates already were at or near zero. The Fed and other central bankers turned to making large-scale purchases of bonds and mortgage-backed securities—a process known as “quantitative easing”—to increase money supply and boost economic activity. The Fed initiated more quantitative easing to address the slowdown caused by Covid.

Meanwhile a consensus grew among policymakers around the world that central banks had to do more than respond to crises: They should be heading crises off. In the United States the Dodd-Frank banking reform law of 2010 included new mandates for the Fed to probe the resilience of the financial system.

For example banks had long conducted “stress tests” internally using hypothetical scenarios to assess whether they could withstand a crisis. Now the Fed and other central bankers were required to conduct system-wide stress tests to gauge the resilience of large banks. Since 2013 the Fed has conducted regular stress tests in which banks provide information on how their balance sheets would be affected by shocks like high inflation high unemployment or recession. Banks that fail stress tests can be subject to restrictions until they build up their capital reserves.

As central bankers’ powers expanded it wasn’t long before climate action advocates international bodies such as the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group and central bankers themselves began to talk about the role national financial institutions and regulators could play perhaps using new tools such as quantitative easing and stress testing to head off the global financial instability that could result from climate change.

Citing heatwaves in North America typhoons in Southeast Asia and droughts in Africa and Australia Mark Carney then-governor of the Bank of England and François Villeroy de Galhau governor of the Bank of France issued a call to action in a 2019 open letter.

“The enormous human and financial costs of climate change are having a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing” they wrote. “As financial policymakers and prudential supervisors we cannot ignore the obvious risks before our eyes.”

Powell: ‘Stick to Our Knitting’

Central bankers around the world have taken the first tentative steps toward integrating climate change into their decision-making.

The Bank of France was the first to conduct a system-wide climate stress test in 2020. The Bank of England followed last year with what it described as a “learning exercise” which would not be used to set new capital requirements. The Bank of England has said it does not plan to publish data for individual firms but will release aggregate results of the exercise in May. (Activists said they feel these efforts don’t go far enough; they’d like to see the stress tests used to make it more expensive for banks to lend to fossil fuel companies and carbon-intensive projects.)

Last month the Bank of Japan offered $18 billion worth of loans to financial institutions in the first of what it anticipates will be twice-yearly auctions to promote activities to fight climate change. The zero-interest loans can be rolled over until 2030 so that banks that boost their green and sustainable lending in essence providing a kind of “green” quantitative easing.

The European Central Bank (ECB) already a large buyer of green bonds plans its first climate stress test this year. ECB President Christine Lagarde has gone further saying that climate should be a consideration in the setting of monetary policy.

“Obviously climate change has an impact on price stability” she said in an interview last year. “It will have an impact on agricultural production it will have an impact on where people live it will have an impact on not only the way we live but the cost of living and that clearly has to be embedded into the analysis that we conduct.”

Lagarde added “There are some traditional thinkers who believe that central banks should altogether stay out of that business and exclusively concentrate on inflation and price stability. I strongly disagree with that myself.”

But at the Fed Powell has taken an opposite view saying flatly at a forum last year that climate change is not a factor in deciding monetary policy. He said the Fed is studying the climate implications for its role as a supervisor and regulator of financial institutions. He has created two internal committees to explore the issue and the Fed has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System the international organization of central bankers that is studying their role in climate change. But he has not committed to conducting a climate stress test or other steps.

At last week’s confirmation hearing while Democrats pressed Powell on his plans for action on climate change Republicans repeatedly admonished him to steer clear of what they called “political” issues including climate change.

“What I worry the most about with the Fed is the mission creep that I think clouds and frankly complicates the main mission of price stability if you’re having to sit around and hire people that are going to assess climate risk” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.)

Cramer whose state is the nation’s No. 2 oil producer blasted the idea of a climate stress test. “The natural outcome is that we’re going to somewhat transfer our climate guilt to other countries who don’t have our environmental and labor standards” he said.

Powell’s response was sure to throw cold water on anyone’s hopes that the Fed would take a leading role in addressing climate change. “I agree with your principle which is that we’ve got to stick to our knitting” he said. “Climate is appropriate for us as an issue to the extent it fits within our existing mandates in the sense of it’s another risk over time that banks are going to run. But the broader answer to climate change has to come from legislators and the private sector.”

Powell also said the possibility of financial instability resulting from the physical risks of climate change “doesn’t seem likely in the near term.”

Lael Brainard a member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors who is Biden’s pick for vice chairwoman is seen as more open to integrating climate change into decision-making. But at her Senate confirmation hearing last Thursday she stopped short of endorsing climate stress tests. Instead she discussed how the central bank might provide guidance to large institutions.

“We would not tell banks which sectors to lend to or which sectors to not lend to” she said “but we do want to make sure they are measuring monitoring and managing their material risks.”

What Can the Fed Do?

In addition to Powell’s reticence the Fed’s history and unique legal framework make it harder for the U.S. central bank to engage in climate activity as aggressively as central bankers elsewhere in the world some experts point out.

For example the European Central Bank established in 1998 explicitly mandates that consideration be given to the environment in executing monetary policy. The Fed’s mandate on monetary policy in contrast is focused narrowly on promoting “the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.” The Bank of England has a specific mandate of “supporting the economic policy of Her Majesty’s Government.” But law and policy concerning the Federal Reserve has been aimed at maintaining its independence from the executive branch and thereby the Biden administration’s climate policy.

“When people look around the world and say ‘It seems like a lot of central banks are doing something why not the Fed?’ it’s because it doesn’t have that relationship to the executive branch. In fact it’s quite the opposite” said Christina Parajon Skinner a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.

Skinner said she wouldn’t be surprised if the Fed uses climate scenario analysis in the future although she believes it wouldn’t have the authority to make it the basis for forcing action by financial institutions.

“The central banks are extremely powerful institutions and they’ve become more and more powerful since the financial crisis” Skinner said. “And they’re very effective institutions. So if you want an expedient result the Fed is a place that people look to not just for climate change but for a lot of different policy issues. We are at a moment in time that the central banks are being sort of pulled to the center of many different debates that take them pretty far outside of their traditional wheelhouse.”

Still many believe that the Federal Reserve could go further to address climate change using its current legal authority. While some activists would like to see the Fed aggressively encourage the financing of clean energy while making lending for fossil fuel projects more costly by setting high capital standards others believe the Fed could have an impact through less prescriptive steps. David Jones who as California’s insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018 spearheaded greater disclosure requirements in that industry said the Fed could immediately improve climate risk disclosure by banks as well as conduct a climate stress test perhaps borrowing from scenarios the European banks already have carried out.

“It’s financial regulatory malpractice not to take up the best practices available now to address climate change and climate risk” said Jones who now directs the Climate Risk Initiative at the University of California Berkeley.

In any case the pressure for action is building. The Financial Stability Oversight Council a board of federal and state financial regulators and experts established under the Dodd-Frank law released a report in October identifying climate change as an “emerging and increasing threat” to U.S. financial stability. One of its main recommendations was that the Fed and other financial regulators increase their internal capacity bringing aboard personnel and know-how to address climate risks.

Biden made a trio of nominations on Friday that are widely seen as attempting to move the Fed in a more progressive direction. His naming of two black economists Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson as his choices to fill open seats on the Fed board and nomination of former fed governor Sarah Bloom Raskin to be the first woman in the Fed’s top job regulating banks came after a push by Democratic lawmakers for more diversity—and more openness to ideas like addressing climate change—at the Fed.

Ceres the investor activist coalition earlier this month issued more than a dozen recommendations for the Fed and other financial regulators including providing guidance to financial institutions on identifying and monitoring climate risks. The Comptroller of the Currency another agency that shares responsibility for bank regulation took a step in that direction last month by issuing draft rules for the nation’s largest banks on how to engage in climate-related risk management.

Ceres has analyzed the risks for U.S. financial institutions from both the physical impact of climate change and the so-called “transitional” risk the risk that their holdings in carbon-intensive industries will suddenly lose value as the world transitions from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. It found that the biggest banks are carrying more than $500 billion of climate risk exposure as a result of investments in sectors that have inadequately prepared for emissions reductions in line with the Paris climate accord. In addition major U.S. banks could lose more than $250 billion annually because of climate change impacts such as supply chain disruptions and lowered productivity as a result of events like coastal flooding and power outages Ceres concluded. Those findings were echoed in a report last fall by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which found that the indirect climate risk exposure for banks that lend to the oil and gas industry could be “economically substantial.”

The report last week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration saying that $145 billion in damages and 688 deaths in the United States were directly attributable to weather disasters in 2021 adds to the urgency for action by the Fed said Steven Rothstein managing director of the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets.

“The world is literally on fire” said Rothstein. “If the job of the Federal Reserve is the safety and soundness of our economy and a full-growth economy and low unemployment our economy cannot achieve those without addressing climate risks.”

A vote on Powell’s nomination is expected in the coming weeks in the Senate where he can be confirmed with a simple majority.

(Ivanhoe Newswire) – Ridesharing a decade ago the closest thing we had was the carpool to work and school now it’s the norm to hit your app and have a complete stranger pick you up and drive you wherever you need to go. But there are dangers to think about.

A new report from Lyft revealed there were more than four thousand cases of sexual assault over a three-year period. Uber reported almost six-thousand sexual assaults over two years. There is no foolproof prevention to keep riders safe but there are precautions riders can take to stay safer.

With more than 25 percent of the U.S. population requesting a ride at least once a month how can you make sure you’re safe? First prepare your purse. Carry a charged cell phone a credit card and cash. Also think about what items like keys or pens could be used for self-defense. Share your trip with others. Both Uber and Lyft make it easy with share buttons directly on their apps.

Before you get in ask the driver if they know your name and confirm their name car and license plate match what is on your phone. Once inside do not share any personal information. Always sit in the backseat. If something seems off end the rideshare early. And now new ride-sharing options are emerging that give women more control in their rideshare choices.

Safr is a gender matching rideshare option in Boston and Orlando. Drivers undergo background checks before being approved. The cars have an SOS button that riders and drivers can touch in case of an emergency. It’s just one way rideshares are becoming safer this year.

Be aware that sexual assaults are more likely to happen on weekend nights when more rideshare users are intoxicated.

American punk rockers Dead Kennedys have never been afraid of controversy. Take ‘Holiday In Cambodia’ an excoriating blues number yet one littered with racial epithets; take ‘Nazi Punks Fuck Off’ a raucous anti-fascist number dedicated to toppling the racists reclaiming a genre based on equality and fairness; and then there’s ‘California über alles’ a blistering treatise of man’s influence under fascism replete with a swaggering guitar hook.

For those of you who are wondering yes “Über Alles” does translate into “above all else” and yes it served as the German national anthem during the Nazi regime. The song is about California Governor Jerry Brown who was challenging Jimmy Carter in the Democratic primary outlining his manifesto disguised as a dictator.

Hefty words and ones that dated quickly but to his credit singer Jello Biafra later conceded that his impressions about Brown were misguided. “I realised I was wrong about my conspiracy theory about Jerry Brown ” he once said. “Sure I’d made it up all by myself and it turned out not to be true so it was updated with Reagan lyrics until ‘We’ve Got A Bigger Problem Now’ and the jazz version we goofed off with at soundcheck wound up becoming a staple of that record and the live show.”

Moreover this incendiary uncompromising rocker is lifted by the powerful drums and the band’s overall commitment to the cause. It doesn’t take a Masters in Commonwealth literature to recognise what author Biafra was referring to with “Big Bro on white horse is near” and “now it is 1984”.

By the time the band had composed this tune they had followed a series of musicians who had paid tribute to George Orwell. David Bowie was the most notable candidate with his Diamond Dogs drips in homage but that would be overlooking Roger Waters efforts on Animals and The Wall. What parts of The Jam’s startling ‘Start!’ that weren’t influenced by The Beatles were also inspired by Orwell’s writings.

But none of the other artists had thrown themselves into the Orwellian narrative with the fury of The Dead Kennedys. Offering no quarter from the opening note the band compliment the world they are building together curating a soundscape based on thunder rhythm and piercing guitar hooks. In other words the song doesn’t embody 1984 it is 1984 portraying a world only shades away from the reality that circled the band.

Punk had yet to take hold in America but the band were better received in England not least because John Peel adored them. It was customary for punks to display contempt towards those on the right of the political spectrum as The Clash had so deftly proven on ‘White Man (In Hammersmith Palais)’ (“If Adolf Hitler were here today…”). The Dead Kennedys fitted nicely into the surroundings and even released the Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables album on the British record label Cherry Red.

In 2005 the song enjoyed a tasty update when Arnold Schwarzenegger stepped in as Governor of California. Biafra re-wrote the song as ‘Kali-Fornia Über Alles 21st Century’ a song which he issued with the Melvins in 2005. Discussing the tune Biafra highlighted some of the zestier lyrics: “How can you drop a song that has lines like ‘Steroids for the master race So you all can have my face?”.

Yet there’s something so timeless about the original embodying a form of anger that rode on the coattails of the punk movement only to offer an alternative that was three times as likely and seven times more terrifying than the path they were already heading down.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDQwNTY2My9UZW5uaXMtc3Rhci1Bc2gtQmFydHktc3RhcnMtY2hpbGxpbmctVFYtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1VYmVyLUVhdHMuaHRtbNIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDQwNTY2My9hbXAvVGVubmlzLXN0YXItQXNoLUJhcnR5LXN0YXJzLWNoaWxsaW5nLVRWLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtVWJlci1FYXRzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tennis star Ash Barty stars in a chilling TV commercial for Uber Eats,"Australia's tennis golden girl Ash Barty 25 will debut her acting skills on Sunday.

Ash told the publication she came up with the idea alongside the Vegemite team saying: 'I think a parmy and Vegemite are both iconically Australian. To create a dish where we combined the two felt like a good idea.'

'Vegemite on toast makes me feel at home it's one of those home comforts you really appreciate when you are far away' she added before confirming she likes to take a tub in her bag for whenever she travels.

She also said that she likes to eat the dish when celebrating a win and will team it with different sides depending on whether she's training or not.

Ash who withdrew from the Sydney Tennis Classic to head straight to Melbourne to prepare for the Australian Open has had a lot to celebrate in recent months.

In November it was revealed that Ash had become engaged to her boyfriend-of-five-years Garry Kissick.

Ash announced the news in an Instagram post sharing two photos of the pair cuddled up together with her diamond ring on display.

2 brothers arrested tied to retail theft

VENTURA COUNTY – Two men were arrested earlier this month after an organized retail theft spree that took place over the past several months throughout Southern California.

In November deputies from Ventura County Sheriff’s in Moorpark responded to a jewelry theft at a department store.

A lone suspect had disabled a security cable affixed to a large jewelry display case and carried it into an awaiting vehicle parked directly in front of the exit authorities said. The store's management estimated the jewelry's value to be over $21500.

Moorpark detectives learned the same suspect was believed responsible for committing similar thefts at seven different locations of the same department store chain throughout region with an estimated loss of more than $124000 officials said.

Detectives later identified the initial suspect a 30-year-old man from North Hollywood. Authorities said he conspired and worked in conjunction with his brother a 37-year-old man from Van Nuys to commit the thefts.

On Jan. 7 Moorpark detectives assisted by the Thousand Oaks Special Enforcement Unit detectives arrested the two suspects outside of an apartment complex in Los Angeles where one of the brothers had been staying.

The brothers were transported and booked at the Ventura main jail on suspicion of grand theft for two incidents that occurred within Ventura County. Bail was set at $75000 for each.

They were both scheduled to appear in Ventura County Superior Court Friday at 1:30 p.m.

Retail theft duo pleads guilty

VENTURA – A pair of 18-year-olds pleaded guilty to eight felony charges on Friday according to Ventura County District Attorney's Office.

On Nov. 27 the two stole 46 bottles of perfume from Ulta Beauty store in Oxnard and 33 bottles from the Camarillo location according to the the district attorney's office.

Areonah Walker 18 of Riverside and Terrion Phillips 18 of Los Angeles used “booster bags” modified to avoid security detection at both stores authorities said.

Phillips drove at dangerous speeds during heavy holiday traffic to escape a pursuit from Ventura County Sheriff’s deputies. The two were eventually arrested.

Investigators later connected Walker to thefts that occurred in October at Ulta Beauty stores in Camarillo and Thousand Oaks and at a Sephora store in Thousand Oaks.

She is also being investigated for allegedly participating in 19 organized retail thefts in San Bernardino Los Angeles San Diego and Riverside counties with losses amounting over $150000.

Walker pleaded guilty to five counts of felony grand theft including the thefts committed in October. Phillips pleaded guilty to two counts of felony grand theft and one felony count of evading a police officer.

The total value of items stolen from Ulta Beauty was over $27000 and from Sephora more than $12000.

Walker and Phillips are scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 10 at 9 a.m. in courtroom 23 of the Ventura County Superior Court. Each count is punishable by up to three years in county jail.

Ghost gun leads to arrest

OXNARD – A 23-year-old Port Hueneme man was arrested Friday in Oxnard on suspicion of felony firearm charges after an apparent ghost gun was found in his vehicle authorities said

At approximately 6:40 p.m. officers from the Oxnard Special Enforcement Unit conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle for a suspected of a traffic infraction at C and Sixth streets according to the Oxnard Police Department.

A driver and two additional passengers were in the vehicle. Officers said they identified one person as an Oxnard criminal street gang member who was on probation for vandalism with court-permitted search terms.

Officers searched the vehicle and found a loaded 9-mm Glock-style polymer 80 semi-automatic handgun.

Polymer guns are sold commercially as incomplete without serial numbers and must be further manufactured to make them into functioning firearms. Guns such as these are often referred to as ghost guns.

Officers arrested the driver for possessing the handgun. He was booked into Ventura County jail on suspicion of felony firearm-related charges.

The 42-year-old partened with to create the mask so it’s no wonder it’s one of her favorites. Hudson helped develop the product after finding inspiration from her longstanding relationship with founder Karen Behnke and their mutual love for clean beauty wellness and environmentalism.

“I feel a genuine connection to Juice Beauty and Karen. In fact she was the one who opened my eyes to clean and green beauty over 15 years ago before it was a thing” said Hudson in a press release for Juice Beauty. “She came to my house and detoxed my bathroom of conventional chemical brands. That was when I realized I had to think differently about my beauty regimen just as I was already doing in other areas of my life.”

During the video Hudson starts off her skincare routine by standing under a facial steamer allowing the steam to cover her face then she mixes the mask in a tiny bowl with water until it turns into a liquid-y texture. Afterwards she uses the tiny brush applicator to smooth it all over her cheeks forehead and nose.

The is designed to gently detoxify impurities and replenish the skin with antioxidant-rich plant nutrients. Its formula is infused with many good-for-you skincare ingredients like acacia powder rose-petal photopigment powder hyaluronic acid salt and organic olive leaf powder.



“It’s not just another mask. It’s exceptional and you can see the results instantly!” Hudson said.

The secret to its hydrating and glowy boost is the high-tech proprietary blend of powders which work to brighten your overall complexion. Meanwhile the rose-petals contain vitamin C a natural skin brightener.

“Vitamin C helps produce collagen (which keeps skin firm and reduces the appearance of wrinkles) protects skin from sun damage and age spots and leaves a brightening effect” said Ranella Hirsch  M.D. a board-certified dermatologist practicing in Boston in a previous interview with Prevention.

If you’re looking for something a bit more bespoke this mask still fits the bill—it can be customized however you like. The notes that you can mix and match the powder to water ratio to create the perfect consistency making the mask as light or rich as you want. In the video you can see Hudson prefers to use a tiny amount of water to make hers leading to a thicker consistency.

Here's Every Product You'll Need,"Depending on how much of it you have shaving peach fuzz is one of those beauty treatments that seems more or less unnecessary — until you actually try it. Beloved by dermatologists celebrities and civilians alike shaving your peach fuzz (or dermaplaning as it’s often more formally called) exfoliates the skin by gently clearing away those fine facial hairs every human has. What’s left behind is smooth and supple dolphin-like skin. Makeup glides on easier and doesn’t cling to tiny patches of fuzz making it last longer overall. All in all it’s a relatively low-effort technique that yields serious benefits.

“Many people are experimenting with at-home dermaplaning” Dr. Deanne Robinson MD dermatologist has told TZR. “While it doesn't replace the effectiveness of having this done by a trained professional in a medical setting there are some obvious benefits namely exfoliation and hair removal.” To get started dermaplaning at home you’ll need a well-lit mirror (natural light is always best) the right face razor and a solid aftercare product. Once acquired pull skin taut and use very gentle scraping motions with the razor on clean dry skin moving down in the direction of your hair’s growth — the same recommended technique for all types of shaving. Dr. Robinson strongly recommends using a fresh razor for every shave to minimize bacteria and maximize effectiveness.

There are just a few things to beware of though. Never run the razor over an open wound acne rash or any other skin injury. The beauty of a nimble peach fuzz razor is how precise it is meaning you can just avoid those areas. Take care around your hairline as it’s all too easy to accidentally jostle yourself and end up with an unexpected bald patch.

Once fuzz-free pat in a soothing aftercare oil cream or serum. Because peach fuzz has a biological purpose (it helps regulate your internal temperature through perspiration and insulation) it’s important to be careful with your new hairless skin immediately after shaving. Consider holding off on makeup for the rest of the day and opt for soothing hydrating products.

And now with federal approval of its flagship system in hand the company is busy looking for industry partners to help bring the production-ready system to market.

FreeFall 5G received certification from the Federal Communications Commission in late November for its FreeStar5G Millimeter Wave Advanced Antenna System.

The certification — which FreeFall 5G had not previously announced — is a big deal for the company which is a partnership formed in 2020 by local startups Electronic Design & Development (ED2) and FreeFall Aerospace said Alex Rodriguez president and CEO of FreeFall 5G.

“It represents a major milestone for a very early-stage company like ours in the global wireless sector” Rodriguez said. “And it’s also critical from a vantage point of moving from that stage into our go-to-market strategy if you will.”

“To have any credibility you have to go through processes like these which are critical” he said citing the FCC tests for safety and radiation.

The company says its FreeStar5G antenna system which it unveiled last October at the Mobile World Congress industry trade show in Los Angeles offers significantly greater range than other systems at lower cost with a relatively low profile and lower power consumption than competing technologies.

The FreeStar5G antenna system operates in the millimeter wave or mmWave part of the radio spectrum a still-emerging technology that offers the fastest data-transfer speed of today’s 5G technologies which for now mostly operate at lower frequencies.

While most so-called 5G systems by U.S. cellular carriers operate at lower frequency bands the carriers are transitioning to much faster mmWave systems putting FreeFall 5G in the right place at the right time said Sergio Cardona president and CEO of ED2.

“I would expect that the full deployment would be in the next three or four years so we’re still in the early stages” said Cardona a former Raytheon engineer who co-founded two successful microelectronics startups before acquiring Florida-based ED2 and re-establishing the company here in 2018.

Cardona said the FreeStar5G system uses a multiple signal input and output system to constantly seek and transmit signals in a 360-degree radius and can each host up to three or four separate radios meaning one antenna system can serve multiple carriers.

In contrast the so-called phased array antennas predominantly used for cellular signals beam a narrow beam that essentially tracks users.

“We’re instantaneously covering and tracking everyone at the same time” Cardona said adding that phased-array systems include extra electronics for tracking that increase energy usage while adding weight and expense.

Fewer FreeStar5G systems are needed to cover the same area significantly reducing the network’s energy consumption said Cardona.

Rodriguez said the 5G industry coalesced around phased-array antenna technology years before any applications were actually tested in the field but it became clear that existing solutions are complicated power hungry expensive and difficult to manage.

FreeFall 5G’s antenna also is a relatively low-profile device that can be mounted on existing structures like streetlights Rodriguez said.

Cardona and Rodriguez acknowledged that many industry players are working to become leaders in 5G technology including major cellular carriers and device makers midsized tech companies and dozens of startups.

But the FreeStar5G antenna system has several advantages and is production-ready Cardona said and the company is looking for industry partners to help bring it to market.

The partner companies have been backed by two homegrown venture-capital funds.

UAVenture Capital a Tucson-based firm that invests exclusively in University of Arizona science and technology announced an undisclosed investment in FreeFall Aerospace in 2018.

DVI Equity Partners the technology investment arm of Tucson’s Diamond Ventures led an initial venture capital round for ED2 in 2019 with a $2.6 million investment.

Rodriguez said FreeFall 5G has retained an investment bank to work with the company as it looks at partnership opportunities while using ED2’s technical know-how to connect with peers and potential partners in the wireless industry.

ED2 which has developed proprietary 5G network equipment including signal filters repeaters and antennas now has 17 employees and is making the electronics for the FreeStar5G antenna system.

FreeFall Aerospace which has about 10 employees is commercializing a new inflatable steerable antenna for communication satellites.

Cardona said FreeFall 5G is the only tech startup working on advanced mmWave technology in Arizona.

“We’re proud of the fact that we’re in Tucson and we have this leading-edge millimeter wave technology” Rodriguez said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As many Americans worry about empty shelves and delayed packages looters are taking advantage of the inflow of goods outside of the two southern California ports that are responsible for handling almost half of all U.S. imports.

In Lincoln Heights a densely populated neighborhood in central Los Angeles that is home to terminals belonging to Union Pacific Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. looters are breaking into cargo containers to steal delivery packages CBS Los Angeles reported.

CBS footage shows lines of packages from carriers including UPS and Amazon.com Inc. many of which arrived from Asia through the nation’s largest ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach stretching along the railways. The looters raided packages that contained all sorts of consumer goods while abandoning those seen as not valuable enough including Covid-19 tests and EpiPens devices used in emergencies to treat severe allergic reactions.

“We have increased the number of Union Pacific special agents on patrol and we have utilized and explored additional technologies to help us combat this criminal activity” Union Pacific told CBS. According to the report the Los Angeles Police Department only responds to reports of train robberies when they come from the carriers which rarely happens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8xNC9lY29ub215L2xhLWZyZWlnaHQtcmFpbHJvYWQtdGhlZnQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBRGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDEvMTQvZWNvbm9teS9sYS1mcmVpZ2h0LXJhaWxyb2FkLXRoZWZ0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thieves in LA are looting freight trains filled with packages from UPS FedEx and Amazon,"Washington DC CNN —

Photos and videos showing piles of empty boxes littered alongside rail tracks in Los Angeles County California have gone viral as shipping companies say they’ve seen a dramatic spike in railroad theft. Some of the boxes are packages from companies like UPS Amazon and FedEx.

Union Pacific one of the country’s largest railroad companies says it may avoid operating in Los Angeles County following the spike in thefts which it blames on lax prosecution of crimes. The containers and trains are locked but can be broken into.

Union Pacific said last month in a letter to the Los Angeles District Attorney that it saw a 160% year-over-year increase in theft in LA county. The company claims that a December 2020 special directive issued by District Attorney George Gascón that changed how low-level offenses are prosecuted has contributed to the uptick.

Union Pacific said in its letter that in the last three months of the year it made over 100 arrests of “active criminals vandalizing our trains” in partnership with the LA police department and Los Angeles Sherriff department. But Union Pacific which has its own police department with jurisdiction over the 32000 miles of tracks it owns said that even as it has expanded its security resources and partnered more closely with local law enforcement the problem isn’t going away. After being arrested individuals are released from custody within 24 hours it said.

Crime is associated with increases in poverty which has increased during the pandemic. The county’s directive was intended to combat social ills that come from misdemeanor convictions such as difficulties with employment housing education government benefits and immigration.

“Studies show that prosecution of the offenses driving the bulk of misdemeanor cases have minimal or even negative long-term impacts on public safety” Gascón said when the directive was issued.

“Our office is committed to working with law enforcement to ensure collective safety across Los Angeles County’s sprawling infrastructure whether it’s at our ports or on railroad tracks” Alex Bastian Special Advisor to District Attorney Gascón said when reached for comment.

“Some cases presented to our office by Union Pacific have been filed such as burglary and grand theft while others have been declined due to insufficient evidence. We make charging decisions based on the evidence. Our office takes Union Pacific’s concerns seriously and hopes to discuss this issue more in the coming weeks” he added.

“While we understand the well-intended social justice goals of the policy we need our justice system to support our partnership efforts with local law enforcement hold these criminals accountable and most important help protect our employees and the critical local and national rail network” Guerrero said.

The Association of American Railroads expressed concern about the crime increase.

“In coordination with local law and where necessary federal law enforcement partners the industry is committed to pursuing all avenues necessary to address this criminal behavior” spokesman Ted Greener said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8xNi9jcmV3cy13b3JrLXRvLXJpZ2h0LXRyYWluLXRoYXQtZGVyYWlsZWQtbmVhci1sYS1zaXRlLW9mLXJlY2VudC13YXZlLW9mLWNhcmdvLXRoZWZ0cy_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMTYvY3Jld3Mtd29yay10by1yaWdodC10cmFpbi10aGF0LWRlcmFpbGVkLW5lYXItbGEtc2l0ZS1vZi1yZWNlbnQtd2F2ZS1vZi1jYXJnby10aGVmdHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crews work to right train cars that derailed near LA site of recent wave of cargo thefts,"Union Pacific crews worked to clear tracks on Sunday Jan. 16 a day after a derailment snarled rail lines in Lincoln Heights — near an area where thousands of empty boxes were left behind by cargo thieves.

Thieves have been raiding cargo containers aboard trains nearing downtown Los Angeles for months taking packages belonging to people across the U.S. and leaving the tracks blanketed with discarded boxes.

It wasn’t clear if the derailment was the result of debris left behind by cargo thieves but images from the scene showed the ground littered with empty boxes from companies such as UPS and Amazon.

The packages are from retailers including Amazon REI and others CBSLA reported Thursday. The sea of debris includes items that the thieves apparently didn’t think were valuable enough to take.

“At this time there is no estimated time for completion (of the derailment cleanup) and the cause remains under investigation” Union Pacific spokeswoman Robynn Tysver said. “No one was injured.”

The derailment occurred around 4 p.m. Saturday at the intersection of San Pablo Street and Valley Boulevard which was then blocked indefinitely according to USC which has its Health Science Campus nearby.

A total of 17 cars derailed Union Pacific told KTLA.

Union Pacific has asked the L.A. County District’s Attorney’s Office to prosecute anyone arrested for the crimes.

“Some cases presented to our office by Union Pacific have been filed such as burglary and grand theft while others have been declined due to insufficient evidence” the DA’s Office said in a statement provided to ABC7. “We make charging decisions based on the evidence. Our office takes Union Pacific’s concerns seriously and hopes to discuss this issue more in the coming weeks.”

Chaotic scenes have been witnessed on rail lines in recent weeks.

Last week while CBSLA cameras were on the scene one person was spotted running off with a container used to hold small packages and a Union Pacific railroad police officer was spotted pursuing two other people who were apparently going through packages.

The scene was the same in November when NBC4 showed thousands of boxes discarded along the tracks lined with homeless encampments northeast of downtown in the Lincoln Park area.

Union Pacific said in a statement to CBSLA that the railroad was concerned about increased cargo thefts in California.

“We have increased the number of Union Pacific special agents on patrol and we have utilized and explored additional technologies to help us combat this criminal activity. We also will continue to work with our local law enforcement partners and elected leaders” the railroad said.

Amazon said it was directing inquiries to police. The United Parcel Service declined to comment on investigations into the cargo thefts but said it was cooperating with authorities.

“The safety of our customers’ goods and our employees is our highest priority” UPS said in a statement.

The retail supply line has been beset by problems amid the enduring coronavirus pandemic.

As the COVID-19 outbreak hit the half-way point in its first year in summer 2020 online shopping skyrocketed with consumers who could no longer go out to eat go to the movies or a baseball game or even travel using their disposable income to fix up houses create in-home offices and gyms and invest in electronic entertainment.

That led to a cargo surge during which the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach regularly broke container records.

But that surge also nearly crippled the supply chain creating a massive backlog of shipped goods.

The twin ports have labored for months to ease that backlog which crowded the docks with mammoth stacks of cargo containers and forced ships to wait for days and sometimes weeks before they could dock. The backups of container ships and other issues have caused some retail shortages and thrust both ports into the national spotlight.

President Biden’s administration officials as well as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office have been involved in efforts to work through and solve the problems. Port staff and federal officials Port of L.A. spokesman Phillip Sanfield said have met via Zoom meetings conducted three times a week. The longshore union terminal operators and ocean carriers have also been involved in discussions about how to ease the supply chain bottleneck.

The collaborations have led to expanded gate hours a new ship queueing system and fees on companies whose import containers linger at marine terminals.

The ports however have repeatedly delayed implementing that fee initially set to go into effect Nov. 1. The charges if they go into effect will begin at $100 per container increasing by $100 per container each day.

The ports of LA and Long Beach are also set to impose a similar fee on empty containers that remain at terminals for at least nine days. That fee which both harbor commissions must OK is scheduled to begin on Jan. 30.

There were more than 72000 empty containers on LA marine terminals and near-dock yards port officials said last week. They said their goal is to bring the number of empties down to 50000 by the end of this month.

After raising $11.5 million from Foundry and Venrock then crowdfunding its personal robot the company hit a series of challenges. Today Swedish social robotics company Furhat Robotics is offering the beleaguered startup a gentle landing in what the Swedish company says is an all-cash deal. Furhat is tight-lipped about the financial details of the deal but tells TechCrunch that the acquisition was designed to give Furhat a leg up on the hardware side allowing it to leverage its social robotics software on new platforms.

The curiously named Furhat Robotics is planning to keep Misty Robotics’ Colorado home as the base for its U.S. operations and is keeping eight of the most senior staff members of the company as it is finding ways to integrate the two technologies.

“We’re keeping the senior team; the head of operations engineering business development and senior software developers are joining us ” says CEO and co-founder of Furhat Robotics Samer Al Moubayed. “Misty has done a great job in building a very scalable production operation building the products by a well-known partner in China.”

The companies claim they are operating from a “unified vision” and say that Furhat Robotics will continue to support the Misty Robotics brand helping develop and expand the product range as well as integrating Furhat and Misty features to enhance future social robots.

“Acquisitions in the world of social robotics are very rare. This might be the first time this happens in history actually. It’s just a very early stage of the industry” says Al Moubayed. “This company spun out of Sphero. What’s very unique about the robot is that it might look like a toy but it’s very likable very approachable. And yet it’s extremely advanced. What Misty Robotics succeeded at is they put the best technologies available in the world in a very likable robot.”

The Furhat team suggests that its own product — a robot with a rear-projected animated face on it — is great for social robots that need to have an adult personality such as airports train stations or medical applications. What Misty adds to the mix is something that is far more extensible and can be more expressive with its little arms and facial expression. Nonetheless the Furhat team explains that while the two robots look very different they have a lot in common as well.

“For us Misty is the piece that was missing. It helps us access a larger market focusing on education for example” explains Al Moubayed exploring how the acquisition came about. “The technologies are very similar but Misty is great at the hardware front and we are very strong on software. Instead of building a new robot for educational use Furhat decided to start looking for another solution.”

“Furhat Robotics is a true pioneer in its field” commented founder and head of Product at Misty Robotics Ian Bernstein. “We are joining forces to bring the future of robotic applications into the present and the combination of our specialties means that we will see even more incredible real-life applications of this amazing technology in the near future. Social robots are already playing a significant role in our lives and by applying our combined expertise to solve real-world issues the sky truly is the limit.”",,,,,,,,,

Gavin Newsom announced this week plans to extend Medi-Cal coverage to all Californians regardless of their immigration status.

""We are positioned with this budget to be able to deliver on what we've been promoting: Universal health care for all regardless of pre-existing conditions regardless of the ability to pay and regardless of your immigration status"" Newsom said during a visit to Lamont Community Health Center a rural Kern County clinic.

Current law extends Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented immigrants over age 50 and under age 26. This new proposal would fill in the gap for adults of all ages at a projected $2.2 billion annual cost making California the first state in the nation to do so. It would take effect January 2024 if approved.

""We believe in this principle; we believe in the right to have quality care... We also believe that families are strengthened particularly in a state as diverse and large as the state of California with so many mixed-status families"" the governor said.

California's coffers are overflowing with a record $45 billion surplus but opponents of the proposed budget have loudly questioned the state's ability to pay for the measure in future years when the financial outlook may not be so rosy. Voters would likely have to approve a boosted income tax to make universal healthcare a reality in the Golden State.

Newsom addressed those critics preemptively arguing that the state already bears those costs through emergency room visits.

""We have universal health care in the state and in this country but it's on the backend: It's called the emergency room and it's costing you the taxpayer a fortune"" he said.

Civil rights icon and farm labor advocate Dolores Huerta joined Newsom at the press conference in support of what she called a historic moment for the state.

""We are going to be the first in the nation the United States of America that is finally going to recognize our immigrants and to give them the kind of health care that they need she said

Local farmworker advocates echoed Huerta's support for the measure that they argue will help keep the workers who pick the nation's food healthy.

""I think it's long overdue"" Hernan Hernandez founder of the California Farmworker Foundation told the Times-Delta. ""If you look at the undocumented community it doesn't stop at a certain age.

""We need to find a way to make sure that they have health care coverage so that they can have access to services that they need in order to have a better quality of life.""

The Delano-based nonprofit provides services to roughly 250000 Valley farmworkers annually. Of those up to 70% are undocumented.

Hernandez said the proposal is particularly important in the face of the coronavirus pandemic which has disproportionately ravaged the South Valley's farmworker community.

""California is certainly leading the way when it comes to protection and access to health care services for the undocumented community"" he said. ""[Immigrants] are an integral part to our society ... It's immigrants who make sure you have food on the table when you go out to have breakfast lunch and dinner.""

Newsom reiterated his support for Central California at the Kern County event saying the state is working to secure healthcare workers to send to the region's hospitals including Visalia's Kaweah Heath which recently announced it had 200 employees on coronavirus-related leave.

""it is a point of deep pride not just principle that we're here in the Central Valley where we come back over and over and over again to make the point that this state is for all Californians"" Newsom said. ""One of the most dynamic and vibrant parts of California that is represented not just here in Lamont but throughout this region the fastest-growing part of the state of California.""

While the governor's proposal recently passed a key legislative committee it has a long way to go before becoming law. Republicans opposed the law arguing the bill would cost too much and pay doctors and nurses less potentially worsening a shortage of health care workers.

“If government-run health care becomes law millions of Californians will flee the state — either to avoid the $163 billion per year in new taxes or to escape the lengthy waits for care that will become the norm” Assembly Republican Leader Marie Waldron said.

It acquired the Hospital of Central Connecticut in New Britain in 2011 Backus Hospital in Norwich in 2013 and Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington in 2018. In 2019 it acquired St. Vincent’s Medical Center in Bridgeport challenging Yale New Haven Health System in southwest Connecticut. In recent years Hartford HealthCare also added the Southington Surgery Center other Hartford and Waterford surgery centers as well as Middlesex Cardiology and Soundview Medical Associates.

This impressive growth has made Hartford Healthcare a leading health care system in the state. But to St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center — the other major hospital in Hartford — this is monopolistic expansion that could limit consumer choice and drive up prices.

Last week St. Francis sued Hartford Healthcare in U.S. District Court in New Haven accusing its larger rival of jeopardizing competition and limiting consumer choice. It’s seeking unspecified damages and an order prohibiting Hartford HealthCare from continuing its acquisitions.

“Hartford HealthCare’s anti-competitive actions were taken not to compete but specifically to increase its market dominance and ability to charge higher than market rates” St. Francis claims in its lawsuit. “It seeks to do so in significant part by seeking to foreclose the opportunities to compete for patients by other hospitals in Hartford County including its most significant competitor St. Francis.”

Dr. John Rodis and other hospital employees from St. Francis Hospital wave red hearts as a parade of first responders passes the hospital to pay tribute to the health care providers in 2020.

Consumers could face higher costs. One study cited by Kaiser Family Foundation that analyzed highly concentrated hospital markets in California found that an increase in the share of physicians in practices owned by a hospital was associated with a 12% increase in premiums for private plans.

Another study that used private insurer data found an increase in physician-hospital integration was associated with an average price increase of 14% for the same service.

Frances Padilla president of the Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut an advocacy group said Hartford HealthCare is “particularly aggressive” in broadening market share through acquisitions and can raise prices as it reduces competition. Cardiac and orthopedic surgeries – knee and hip replacements for example — are particularly high-margin practices she said.

Access too is affected as Hartford HealthCare frequently requires patients in eastern Connecticut to seek service in Hartford Padilla said.

Recruiting the ‘greatest experts’

Jeffrey Flaks chief executive officer of Hartford HealthCare said the lawsuit is “without merit and we will defend against this legal action in the courts. That will be the proper place to respond.”

Hartford HealthCare is improving access and affordability and recruits the “greatest experts to be our colleagues” he said in a message to Hartford HealthCare employees.

‘Market share’

Spencer Perlman managing partner and director of health care research at Veda Partners in Washington D.C. said a health care anti-competitive lawsuit “seems pretty novel” even as hospitals snap up physician practices in what he said is a common practice to drive up revenue with patient referrals.

Hospitals “battle for market share all the time and it can definitely get ugly” he said.

He cited a recently settled eight-year battle between the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Highmark a health care company over accusations Highmark steered thousands of patients to its network.

Another lucrative reason to acquire physician practices is to take advantage of higher Medicare reimbursements available to “satellite outpatient” departments he said. Previously physician practices they are now rebranded to capture more government money Perlman said.

However administrative and legislative changes are bringing Medicare reimbursement at hospital outpatient departments in line with what’s paid at physicians’ offices Perlman said.

Siphoning off physicians to a dominant health care network that often has “brand recognition” also is successful as it attracts more patients he said.

Ted Doolittle Connecticut’s health care advocate said hospitals infrequently sue each other making the St. Francis lawsuit surprising. But the issue of industry acquisitions is not new.

Charles Muro celebrates being inoculated by Nurse Karen Pagliaro at Hartford Healthcare’s mass vaccination center at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford on May 13 2021.

“Both competitors and people are getting gobbled up” he said.

In its lawsuit St. Francis Hospital says Hartford HealthCare brought in two dozen surgeons and specialists in hematology oncology cardiology and neurology over the last four years. Another nine specialists and primary care physicians have been recruited to work exclusively in a Hartford HealthCare physician hospital network it says.

St. Francis says Hartford HealthCare has acquired the practices of more than 50 physicians established control over doctor referrals and insists on exclusive access to medical equipment.

“These actions do not involve competition to attract patients based on price and quality” St. Francis said in the suit. “Instead they prevent such competition by controlling large numbers of physicians and effectively locking up referrals of their patients.”

Monopoly claim

In its lawsuit St. Francis accuses Hartford HealthCare of bullying physician practices to establish a monopoly. In one case it told physicians that if they balked at joining its health care system it would “crush” them St. Francis claims. And it accused Hartford HealthCare of increasing its market share as it reduced volume at Bristol Hospital.

A spokesman said Bristol Hospital is not a party to the lawsuit and will not comment.

Lisa Freeman executive director of the Connecticut Center for Patient Safety a nonprofit group that speaks for patients said the merits of the lawsuit have yet to be decided and no one knows “whose truth bears out.”

Still a concern is that health care is “turning into business decisions” she said. Surveys show that trust is a key consideration among patients and her advice is to check physician referrals.

The Lighthouse Surgery Center at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center focuses on outpatient orthopedic surgery.

With 33000 employees and operating revenue of $4.9 billion Hartford HealthCare dwarfs Trinity Health of New England the parent company of St. Francis and four other hospitals in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Trinity posted revenue of about $2 billion and employs about 11000 workers.

Hartford HealthCare also outstrips Yale New Haven Health another dominant hospital system in the state. It includes Bridgeport Hospital Greenwich Hospital Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London Yale New Haven Hospital Westerly Hospital in Rhode Island and a physician foundation.

Yale New Haven Health posted revenue of $4.6 billion and employs more than 26000 workers and 6685 medical staff.

State steps in with a study

Legislation enacted last year by the General Assembly and Gov. Ned Lamont directs the Office of Health Strategy to study ways to improve oversight and regulation of physician practice mergers and acquisitions.

The study included in broader legislation related to hospital billing and collections will review laws regulations and transactions of physician practices. The study which must be completed by Feb. 1 2023 will look at ways to ensure the viability of physician practices and develop legislative recommendations to improve reporting and oversight of physician practice mergers and acquisitions.

State Rep. Jonathan Steinberg House chairman of the public health committee said lawmakers responded to a trend that private equity firms are acquiring physician practices. “As with other industries it’s often about cost-cutting and not about delivering quality service” he said.

Steinberg a Westport Democrat said the acquisitions of physician groups is “hardly a new phenomenon.” Research published in February 2020 by the Journal of the American Medical Association said physician practice acquisitions by private equity firms increased to 136 in 2016 up from 59 in 2013.

Questions now focus on whether the change in ownership of physician practices has reached a tipping point is anti-competitive and where government fits in when interfering in market forces Steinberg said.

The trend he said is “in some ways a natural outgrowth of what we’re doing in managed care.”

“Punjab government want everyone in remote areas to have access to health facilities and by March 2022 all families in Punjab will receive health cards” he said while speaking to PTV news channel.

He said that every family head would be able to get access to free treatment facility up to one million rupees per annum against Naya Pakistan Sehat Card adding all permanent residents of Punjab will get free health insurance through NADRA’s transparent and computerized mechanism.

Underprivileged segments of population in all districts of Punjab would enjoy quality healthcare services without any financial barriers he said adding the program would cover entire population of the Punjab under Universal Health Insurance soon.

He said that after enrollment under the scheme the beneficiary would be eligible to go to any hospital on panel across the country adding over 519 hospitals were being included in panel hospitals.

“Sehat Insaaf card holders would get the treatment of different diseases including cardiac surgery diabetes accidents cancer kidney disease gynae thalassemia and other accident related surgeries adding OPDs are already free in all public hospitals”.

The universal healthcare programme was started from Sahiwal and Dera Ghazi Khan divisions he said adding Sehat Insaf Card would be further extended in other divisions including Punjab including Rawalpindi Bahawalpur Faisalabad Gujranwala is and Multan.

He also appealed that the citizens of Punjab should update their NADRA records and get Sehat sahulat card facility adding government of Punjab would also planned to reach every residents of province and provide these health card facilities to their door steps without any hassle free atmosphere.

(Seychelles News Agency) - Chennai’s MIOT International Hospital on Friday opened a new state of the art eye care facility in Seychelles at a cost of $900000 becoming the first Indian hospital to provide full-time services in the island state an archipelago in the western Indian Ocean.

Prithvi Mohandas director of MIOT International said that the facility will “provide end-to-end services in Seychelles especially because of the pressing need with this pandemic for people to have safe treatment.”

“With this in mind we have opened this facility which is the first of its kind where we will be providing in-house services end to end” he added.

The MIOT International Total Eye Care clinic located at the Espace building on Mahe was created in collaboration with Visus Optical Seychelles and employs 16 Seychellois and 6 Indians.

It offers services ranging from diagnosis to complete treatments such as treating dry eye symptoms and other minor procedures removing the need for patients to travel overseas for treatments that are not available locally.

President Wavel Ramkalawan who opened the facility with First Lady Linda Ramkalawan in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Friday said that it will be beneficial to the Ministry of Health.

“We were already sending people overseas for the services they have now made available here. The centre will also open doors for medical tourism in Seychelles as patients who would normally go to Chennai for their treatment will be able to do so here instead” he added.

Established in 1999 the Madras Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology known as MIOT International is a multi-speciality hospital and since 2010 Seychelles has been sending patients there as it provides medical care in over 63 specialities.

Seychellois citizens enjoy free universal healthcare and the government pays for overseas treatment for persons who are not able to receive treatment in local health care facilities and have exhausted all treatment options in the country.

In 2021 over 100 patients were sent to India for treatment.

“For many years we have been able to rely on their support be it outside of Seychelles or in Chennai. When we knocked on their door for the specialist that we needed in Seychelles they have always been forthcoming with the help and support” said health minister Peggy Vidot.

“As part of the development of the health sector in Seychelles we always welcome private investments which supplement our own. As a country we are very open and the President is always pushing the health agenda forward” she added."

Como fue adelantado hace unas semanas las compras de Navidad sufrieron un bajón sustancial en Estados Unidos. No ocurrió solo en Florida o Miami. Se trata de una realidad que se extendió por todo el país.

Hay varias explicaciones: la mayoría de ellas afloró esta semana con la publicación de los primeros datos de los vendedores canalizados por la agencia Associated Press (AP). Van desde la escasez de productos de venta general hasta el aumento de precios y el surgimiento de la variante Ómicron de la COVID-19.

A fines de noviembre hubo en efecto una explosión de compras que por los precios se redujo drásticamente en diciembre cuando los presupuestos familiares tuvieron que reducirse. La mayoría de los compradores tuvieron que lidiar con precios mucho más altos que el presupuesto planificado.

“Un factor clave ha sido la inflación. El 6% alcanzado no le facilitó la vida a nadie. La gente tuvo que desviar sus recursos hacia otros gastos como los normales del día a día” explicó a OnCuba la analista de mercado Lucía Muñoz.

Las ventas minoristas enfrentaron un aumento de casi 2% en los precios de los productos en todo el territorio estadounidense lo que provocó en diciembre un aumento de 0.3%. Las ventas habían aumentado un 1.8 % en octubre porque los consumidores preocupados por la escasez de productos se adelantaron a sus compras navideñas. Aun así las ventas minoristas aumentaron un 16.9% el mes pasado en comparación con diciembre de 2020 dijo el viernes el Departamento de Comercio. Durante todo 2021 las ventas aumentaron un 193 % en comparación con el año anterior.

Las caídas del gasto se repartieron entre numerosos sectores. Las ventas de tiendas departamentales cayeron un 7% las de restaurantes un 0.8% y las en línea un 8.7% en comparación con el mes anterior según el informe referido. Es decir las ventas en línea no fueron un factor significativo en estas navidades como se esperaba concluyó la agencia AP.

Ómicron fue identificado por la Organización Mundial de la Salud a fines de noviembre. El informe de diciembre del Departamento de Comercio es el primero en captar algunos de sus efectos en el comportamiento del consumidor.

El informe minorista mensual cubre solo alrededor de un tercio del gasto total de los consumidores y no incluye el dinero gastado en cosas como cortes de cabello estancias en hoteles o boletos de avión todo lo cual tiende a hacer que el negocio disminuya cuando la ansiedad por la COVID-19 aumenta. En noviembre no obstante las ventas de restaurantes registraron un aumento del 1% el mejor desempeño del sector desde julio en el país.

Los analistas de la industria sospechan que los compradores que esperaron hasta el último minuto no encontraron lo que querían y compraron tarjetas de regalo no aparecerán en los datos minoristas hasta que se canjeen esas tarjetas. La entidad no dio cifras posibles del valor total de las tarjetas compradas.

Es un hecho que esta era única en la que vivimos ha sesgado una serie de indicadores económicos. Muchos economistas creen que el ajuste estacional de las ventas minoristas se ha visto afectado por la pandemia que ha alterado los patrones de gasto de los estadounidenses.

El ajuste estacional tiene por objeto dar cuenta del pico normal de compras en diciembre para la temporada navideña. Sin embargo este año debido a la escasez los estadounidenses comenzaron a comprar temprano para las fiestas y el ajuste estacional podría haber exagerado cualquier retroceso de diciembre. Y los estadounidenses este año no han retrocedido en el gasto. Lo que están haciendo es gastar su dinero de manera diferente.

La Federación Nacional de Minoristas está analizando las cifras de ventas del mes pasado y publicará su informe en los próximos días. El grupo de comercio minorista más grande del país ha proyectado un crecimiento récord de 8.5% y 10.5% en comparación con los mismos dos meses del año pasado lo que en cierta medida contradice al Departamento de Comercio.

Mastercard SpendingPulse que rastrea todo tipo de pagos incluidos efectivo y tarjetas de débito informó a fines del mes pasado que las ventas navideñas aumentaron un 85% desde el 1 de noviembre hasta el 24 de diciembre con respecto al año anterior. Ese fue el ritmo más rápido en 17 años. Pero la mayoria de las compras como se vio ocurrieron en noviembre.

“El gasto de los consumidores seguirá siendo la piedra angular del crecimiento económico este año pero el camino a corto plazo será irregular en medio del aumento de los casos de Ómicron” dijo Lydia Boussour economista principal de Oxford Economics. Lo mismo piensa Stephen Stanley economista jefe de Amherst Pierpoint señalando le existencia de un mercado laboral fuerte y una demanda acumulada masiva además de “una enorme cantidad de dinero extra para gastar”. “La gente volverá a gastar una vez que la ola de Ómicron se desvanezca” predijo Stanley.

Lo cierto es que “comenzamos la temporada navideña en una posición sólida pero desde entonces hemos experimentado varias consecuencias de la variante Ómicron que incluyen mayores restricciones de capacidad disponibilidad de personal más limitada y horas de funcionamiento reducidas en ciertos lugares” dijo el CEO de Amherst Calvin McDonald.

Y la inflación se ha asentado en casi todos los niveles de la economía lo que obligó a la Reserva Federal estadounidense a dejar de describir el aumento de los precios como algo “transitorio”.

La inflación saltó a su ritmo más rápido en casi cuarenta años el mes pasado un aumento del 7 % respecto al año anterior que está incrementando los gastos domésticos y afectando las ganancias salariales.

Han destacado sobre todo las cifras de ventas de América con un 14% de incremento Asia Pacífico (mismo porcentaje) y EMEA (Europa Oriente Medio y África un 12% más) con volúmenes de 35% 27% y 39% respectivamente sobre el total.

Ventas de Lamborghini en 2021

Por mercados individuales EE.UU es el más importante con 2.472 unidades 11% en 2021 y China el segundo con 935 +55%. Les siguen Alemania (706 +16%) y el Reino Unido (564 +9%). También ha destacado el comportamiento del mercado italiano donde se entregaron 359 coches (+3%).

Por modelos el SUV Urus es el de más éxito gracias a unas ventas de 5.021 unidades. Le siguen el Huracán V10 con 2.586y el Aventador (V12) con 798.

Para este 2022 las perspectivas de ventas son positivas dado que Lamborghini asegura que tiene una importante cartera de pedidos que de hecho ya casi cubre toda la producción prevista para 2022.

La marca en su presentación de resultados también ha mostrado parte de sus planes. Plantea presentar cuatro nuevos productos en los próximos 12 meses y enfatizar su estrategia “Direzione Cor Tauri” (“Hacia Cor Tauri”) que busca descarbonizar varios de sus modelos y la sede de Sant’Agata Bolognese buscando una mayor sostenibilidad medioambiental.

Para ello Lamborghini invertirá más de 1.500 millones de euros en los próximos cuatro años con la vista puesta en el lanzamiento de su primer híbrido en 2023 y electrificar su gama al completo a finales de 2024 con el objetivo de reducir las emisiones de CO2 en un 50% a partir de 2025.

Ya para más adelante en la segunda mitad de la década la gama del fabricante italiano contará con un modelo totalmente eléctrico.

Así lo explica Stephan Winkelmann Presidente y CEO de Automobili Lamborghini: ""Este récord nos permite confirmar cuatro factores: la solidez de nuestro plan estratégico la sobresaliente reputación de nuestra marca en todo el mundo la competitividad y la pasión de nuestra gente y la excepcional profesionalidad y dinamismo que han mostrado nuestros 173 concesionarios situados 52 mercados que han continuado invirtiendo junto a nosotros en este tiempo desafiante e incierto”.

Ecuador en 2021 incrementó hasta 51% las exportaciones anuales de petróleo y mejoró considerablemente las de camarón además de aumentar los ingresos por café atún pescado y flores que figuran entre sus principales productos de venta informó el domingo el Banco Central (BCE).

El país sudamericano cuya economía dolarizada depende del crudo aumentó en 51% las ventas de petróleo de 4.685 millones de dólares en 2020 a 7.090 millones entre enero y noviembre de 2021 según el más reciente informe de la entidad.

De su lado las exportaciones de camarón subieron un 24% pasando de 3.824 millones a 4.755 millones de dólares.

El presidente ecuatoriano el conservador Guillermo Lasso celebró hace poco que su país se convirtió el año pasado en el primer productor mundial del crustáceo con un millón de toneladas recabadas.

Entre esos períodos también se incrementaron las exportaciones de flores en 2% (de USD 827 millones a USD 844 millones) de pescado en 5% (de USD 252 millones a USD 265 millones) las de atún en 8% (de USD 63 millones a USD 68 millones) y de café en 4% (de USD 9 millones a USD 13 millones).

Ecuador con 177 millones de habitantes afronta una crisis económica agravada por efectos de la pandemia de coronavirus que deja a la fecha 614.032 casos (3469 por cada 100.000 personas) y 34.219 muertos constituyéndose en la séptima nación latinoamericana con más fallecidos por el covid-19 según un conteo de la AFP en base a cifras oficiales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjb25vbWlzdGEuZXMvZW1wcmVzYXMtZmluYW56YXMvbm90aWNpYXMvMTE1NjQ5MDcvMDEvMjIvTGEtcGFyYWRvamEtZGUtbG9zLXByZXNlcnZhdGl2b3MtcG9yLXF1ZS1zdXMtdmVudGFzLXNlLWRlc3Bsb21hcm9uLWR1cmFudGUtbGEtcGFuZGVtaWEuaHRtbNIBkQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVjb25vbWlzdGEuZXMvZW1wcmVzYXMtZmluYW56YXMvYW1wLzExNTY0OTA3L0xhLXBhcmFkb2phLWRlLWxvcy1wcmVzZXJ2YXRpdm9zLXBvci1xdWUtc3VzLXZlbnRhcy1zZS1kZXNwbG9tYXJvbi1kdXJhbnRlLWxhLXBhbmRlbWlh?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La paradoja de los preservativos: por qué sus ventas se desplomaron durante la pandemia,"Parece difícil de creer pero durante la pandemia las ventas del mayor fabricante del mundo de preservativos se desplomaron un 40%. Esto es lo que le ocurrió a Karex la empresa de Malasia que fabrica uno de cada cinco preservativos vendidos en todo el mundo.

Para Karex el confinamiento durante la pandemia parecía el escenario perfecto para impulsar más aún sus ventas. Todo hacía indicar que iba a ser así ya que el teletrabajo sumado a las pocas ganas de tener hijos durante esta crisis económica podían ser dos buenas razones de peso para el crecimiento de este sector.

Sin embargo el director ejecutivo de Reckitt Benckiser el fabricante británico de Durex ya descubrió en abril de 2020 la relación existente entre cuantas menos conexiones sociales mayores niveles de ansiedad lo que provocó una disminución en las compras de preservativos en todo el mundo.

Los cierres de hoteles y moteles también jugaron un papel importante en la provisión de espacios apartados para la intimidad centrados por ejemplo en el sexo durante las vacaciones o por infidelidades. Además la industria del sexo normalmente un mercado importante de este producto ha sido un factor mucho menos importante en los últimos dos años.

Los gobiernos y organizaciones sin ánimo de lucro son los mayores compradores de preservativos

Un factor igual de importante viene dado por los gobiernos y organizaciones sin ánimo de lucro los dos principales compradores cada año de este método anticonceptivo. Por ejemplo China reparte 1.000 millones de condones gratis al año como parte de su programa de planificación familiar; y la ciudad de Nueva York regala más de 30 millones al año para garantizar el sexo seguro.

""Una gran parte es distribuida por los gobiernos de todo el mundo que han reducido la distribución significativamente durante el COVID-19"" dijo Goh Miah Kiat director ejecutivo de Karex a Nikkei Asia. ""Por ejemplo en el Reino Unido el NHS (Servicio Nacional de Salud) cerró la mayoría de las clínicas no esenciales debido a la COVID y también ocurrió lo mismo con las clínicas de salud sexual que repartían condones"".

Trojan la otra gran compañía de preservativos en Estados Unidos reflejó durante la pandemia que ""los jóvenes de 18 a 24 años están ansiosos por recuperar su vida social. Se espera un crecimiento a medida que la sociedad se abra y los consumidores tengan una mayor movilidad"".

Paso a la diversificación

En el caso de Karex que opera en 140 países se ha visto en la obligación de diversificar su política de negocio con la fabricación de guantes médicos un producto que ha experimentado un boom durante la pandemia. Y lo hace el número uno de fabricantes de preservativos con una producción anual de más de 5.500 millones de condones muy por encima de su perseguidor Thai Nippon Rubber que produce alrededor de 2.000 millones.

Aún así en las últimas semanas las ventas de estos productos anticonceptivos ha mejorado tal y como indicó Karex a Nikkei. Esto está en línea con los datos de otros vendedores importantes de preservativos incluidos Durex y Trojan que informaron de unas mejores ventas a medida que se levantaron las restricciones de movilidad.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdmFuZ3VhcmRpYS5jb20vcGFydGljaXBhY2lvbi9sYXMtZm90b3MtZGUtbG9zLWxlY3RvcmVzLzIwMjIwMTE1Lzc5ODMwOTEvcGxhemEtdG9yb3MtbWFkcmlkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perspectiva de Las Ventas desde la M-30,"""Realicé estas fotografías al borde de la M-30 en Madrid capital desde el que puede apreciarse el atardecer sobre la plaza de toros de Las Ventas"" destaca Francisco José Eguibar Padrón en Las Fotos de los Lectores de La Vanguardia.

La plaza de toros de Las Ventas de Madrid es el mayor coso taurino de España. Con 23 798 espectadores es la tercera con más aforo del mundo tras las de México y Valencia (Venezuela). También es la segunda más grande en cuanto al diámetro de su ruedo (615 m) tras la de Ronda.

Ampliar Atardecer desde la M-30.. Francisco José Eguibar Padrón

Desde 1994 la plaza de toros de Las Ventas es un edificio considerado como bien de interés cultural con categoría de monumento histórico-artístico.

Es de estilo neomudéjar con estructura metálica y fachada de ladrillo visto. Se empezó a construir durante la dictadura del General Primo de Rivera y se finalizó en la Segunda República. La anterior plaza madrileña situada donde se encuentra ahora el Palacio de los Deportes tenía una capacidad inferior a la demandada por el público.

En la fachada de Las Ventas los escudos realizados en cerámica representan todas las provincias españolas.

El torero José Gómez fue quien tuvo la idea de construir una plaza monumental que albergase el mayor número de espectadores y que además abaratase el precio de las entradas.

La plaza actual fue diseñada por el arquitecto José Espeliú que murió antes de ver la obra terminada. El proyecto lo finalizó Manuel Muñoz Monasterio quién además diseñó el Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.

On Thursday China’s foreign minister Wang Yi told his Emirati counterpart that Beijing wants to “accelerate” negotiations on the development of a free trade area to “inject new impetus” into enhancing ties with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

'They [the Gulf] have been among those markets to which Chinese investments still held up even if Chinese investments in general have been wavering' - Ralf Wiegart IHS Markit

The comments echo similar ones made this past week as foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia Kuwait Oman and Bahrain along with the secretary-general of the GCC all descended on the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi for talks on security and trade.

A readout from the meeting between Yi and GCC Secretary General Nayef Falah Mubarak Al-Hajraf said the two sides believe “conditions are ripe” for establishing a strategic partnership agreement between China and the bloc and that Beijing was looking to ""share the opportunities"" of its ""huge market"" with the Gulf.

China is the GCC’s top trading partner with bilateral economic activity between the bloc and the world’s second-largest economy standing at $180 bn in 2020.

The two sides first tabled a free trade deal in 2004 but the talks have been stalled for years. Torbjorn Soltvedt a Gulf analyst with the global risk consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft told Middle East Eye he saw “strong incentives for both sides” to renew those discussions.

“This is probably a time for talks to move forward and for there to be some real progress” he added.

Beijing’s influence in the Gulf has been growing for nearly a decade. The region is a central pillar of President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road initiative and China has emerged as the Gulf’s biggest buyer of crude oil supplying the Asian country with more than 40 percent of its imports.

Gulf economic heavyweights like the UAE and Saudi Arabia rank in the top three countries globally for Chinese construction projects while Beijing has also invested in smaller states like Oman where it is building an industrial zone in the Arabian Sea port of Duqm.

Analysts say the economic relationship between the two sides has weathered the storm of the coronavirus pandemic which has seen China draw down its foreign investments in other regions as it focuses on looming economic challenges at home.

“They [the Gulf] have been among those markets to which Chinese investments still held up even if Chinese investments in general have been wavering” Ralf Wiegart Head of MENA economics at IHS Markit told MEE.

Hedging bets

In recent years Beijing’s economic relationship with the Gulf has grown well beyond shovel-ready construction projects and oil wells. Gulf states are big buyers of Chinese surveillance technology. Huawei’s 5G networks have been rolled out from the Bahraini capital of Manama to the business hub of Dubai. And in Saudi Arabia Beijing is helping the country develop nuclear technology.

Despite the objections of Washington long the dominant security and economic power in the Gulf the countries appear to be pressing ahead with closer ties to China.

In December the UAE suspended discussions with Washington to acquire its state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jet due to frustration over the slow pace of talks amid US concerns about Abu Dhabi's relationship with China.

This past week Beijing renewed its pledge to continue deepening ties with Gulf powers.

In a readout from the meeting between Al-Hajraf and Yi the two sides agreed to “help the GCC countries become logistics and shipping hubs leading neighbouring areas and attract more foreign capital and technologies to the Gulf region”.

Jamal Abdullah a scholar on the Gulf and visiting professor at the University of Montreal in Canada said the flurry of diplomatic meetings this week demonstrated just how far the Gulf states have moved towards China as they fret about the US commitment to their security and grow discontented with Washington's criticism of their domestic politics and human rights.

UAE's China ties cast doubt on purchase of US F-35 fighter jets Read More »

“These countries are closer in geography and closer in outlook to Beijing” he said. ""They are not going to abandon the US but they are hedging their bets economically and politically.""

At the same time as Beijing was hosting top Gulf diplomats China was also preparing for the visit of Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on Friday.

While China has been eager to make inroads with Arab countries it remains one of Tehran's top international allies. The two countries signed a 25-year strategic partnership agreement last year and China is a signatory to the 2015 nuclear agreement that world powers are trying to revive in Vienna.

“The Gulf states want to create a balance with China to protect themselves from Iran"" Abdullah added.

Ironically enough it is uncertainty over the fate of the Iranian nuclear deal that has contributed to an easing of tensions between Gulf powers like Saudi Arabia and Qatar which Abdullah says may actually make it easier for the countries to bridge their differences and revive negotiations with Beijing on a free trade agreement.

Still he voices scepticism about a breakthrough anytime soon. “The Gulf countries will all deepen their ties with China but I don’t believe they are united enough to work together as a bloc”.",,,,,,,,,,,,
VZ,Verizon,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL2FydGljbGVzL3Zlcml6b24tbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkLW5vLWFubnVhbC1mZWUtYW5kLWJpZy1yZXdhcmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon Launches New Credit Card With No Annual Fee and Big Rewards,"Many non-financial companies have released their own credit cards in recent years. Now Verizon is joining the trend. The Verizon Visa Card officially launched on June 26.

When brands launch credit card products the results are often underwhelming -- but that isn't the case here. Verizon's new credit card is an impressive no-annual-fee card. It's a uniquely powerful offer Verizon customers should consider.

Perks of the Verizon Visa Card

Earn up to 4% back: The highlight of the Verizon Visa Card is its rewards. Here's how much you'll earn back with this card:

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

4% on gas and groceries

3% on dining

2% on Verizon purchases

1% on all other purchases

Those are excellent earnings rates in several popular spending categories. In fact the Verizon Visa Card rivals the best cash back credit cards. The Verizon card has one main difference: it doesn't earn cash back. It earns Verizon Dollars. You can redeem these for any purchases with Verizon.

While Verizon Dollars are less flexible than cash back this shouldn't be a problem for cardholders. You need a Verizon account to get the card. Simply apply your rewards toward your monthly bill to redeem your savings.

Eligible for Verizon Auto Pay discount: The Verizon Visa Card is the only credit card eligible for Verizon's Auto Pay discount. If you don't have the card then you must use a debit card or checking account as your payment method to get the discount. The discount is either $5 or $10 per line per month (depending on your plan).

The Auto Pay discount is a fantastic feature that can benefit any Verizon customer. When you set up Auto Pay with this card you can get a discount on your bill and earn 2% back every month. Without the Verizon Visa Card you'd need to choose between paying by debit card to get the discount or paying by an alternate credit card to earn credit card rewards. With a Verizon card you can have both.

Up to $100 in credits: You can get up to $100 in credits on your Verizon wireless or Fios bill in the 24 months after you open the Verizon Visa Card. You'll also receive a credit of $4.17 every month that you pay your bill in full using either your Verizon card or Verizon Dollars.

No annual or foreign transaction fees: This card charges no annual fee. You can also use it internationally without any foreign transaction charges.

Who's eligible?

You can apply for the Verizon Visa Card if you're a Verizon wireless customer. You must be the Account Owner or Account Manager to apply. Additionally you are only eligible if the account has 10 phone lines or less. This card isn’t available for wireless accounts with more than 10 phone lines or Verizon Prepaid accounts.

How to apply

You can apply on the web in the My Verizon app in stores or by calling customer service.

Should you get Verizon's new credit card?

If you have a Verizon wireless account then you should strongly consider getting the Verizon Visa Card. It earns strong bonus rewards in a variety of categories -- you could easily use it for all your spending. Even if you only use the card to pay your Verizon bill you'll save $5 or $10 per line every month from the Auto Pay discount and get 2% back. That's a deal you won't get from any other credit card.

However the carrier is now offering up to $700 off the Pixel 6 (with trade-in) or up to $800 off the Pixel 6 Pro (with trade-in).

If you're in the market for a new smartphone Verizon phone deals have been hot since the start of the holidays. And now Big Red is back with a killer deal that's available today only.

Currently at Verizon buy a Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro and you'll get a free Pixel 6 of equal or lesser value for free. You'll need to make your purchase via monthly installments and the phones must include an unlimited plan. Otherwise it's one of the best Pixel 6 deals we've seen.

Pixel 6 / Pixel 6 Pro: buy one get one free @ Verizon

For a limited time at Verizon buy a Pixel 6 and you'll get another Pixel 6 of equal or lesser value for free. You'll need to make your purchase via monthly installments and the phones must include an unlimited plan. Plus you'll get an additional $1000 off if you switch from a competing carrier.

The Pixel 6 is Google's latest take on Android featuring a new version of its operating system plus its custom Tensor chip. This chip imbues the Pixel 6 with a host of features including Magic Eraser which uses AI to delete unwanted objects in photos and Face Unblur — which uses the Pixel 6's dual cameras to take photos at different speeds then combines them for a clearer image.

Motion mode meanwhile is the opposite of Face Unblur in that it adds a blur effect to fast-moving objects to give a unique effect. And Live Translate is able to use the power of AI and Google's software to translate conversations accurately in real time.

In our Pixel 6 review we were equally impressed by its hardware. It sports a 6.4-inch OLED display with a 2400 x 1080 resolution at 90Hz. It has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage while a 256GB option is also available. And it's rocking a 50MP main camera a 12MP ultrawide and an 8MP selfie shooter.

Meanwhile in our Pixel 6 Pro review we named Google's phone the best value-based flagship you can buy. It sports a larger 6.7-inch OLED display with 3120 x 1440 resolution at 120Hz 12GB of RAM 128GB of storage and a 50MP main camera.

While AT&T was the biggest spender at $9 billion Dish spent $7.3 billion and T-Mobile followed behind at $2.9 billion. Verizon was notably absent from the auction. A number of smaller players also made the list like Three Forty-Five Spectrum which you can view on Light Reading’s site.

This is the third-largest FCC auction yet with total bids reaching about $22.5 billion

The auction officially ended in November but the FCC hasn’t publicly disclosed the winning bidders until now (PDF). Total bids reached about $22.5 billion making it the third-largest FCC spectrum auction yet. Only last year’s $80 billion C-band auction (over half of which was contributed by Verizon) and 2015’s $44.9 billion AWS-3 auction top this amount of spending as pointed out by Next TV (via Light Reading).

When it comes to using the 3.45GHz band however Light Reading says that companies will have to deploy new radios on cell towers that have the ability to broadcast signals across it. Smartphones that support C-band may already be capable of using the band Light Reading also notes as they both fall under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) n77 technical standards that cover 3.3GHz to 4.2GHz which existing 5G smartphones already use.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmdhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLW5ld3MvMjAyMi8wMS81Zy11cGdyYWRlLXRvLWxlYXZlLW9sZGVyLXBob25lcy13aXRob3V0LXNlcnZpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5G upgrade to leave older phones without service,"Upgrades to the next generation of phone service technology will result in some older phones being disconnected from service in early this year according to the Federal Communications Commission.

Phones that will lose service will be unable to call 911 according to Lieutenant Adam Reed the director of the state police’s communications office.

“During an emergency every minute counts whether you need police fire or medical assistance” Reed said.

AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile have announced plans to shut down their 3G networks to accommodate more advanced services such as 5G as early as February the FCC said.

AT&T announced it will finish shutting down its 3G network by February while Sprint’s 3G CDMA network will follow by March 31. Then Sprint’s 4G LTE network will be completely removed by June 30 as a result of the merger between Sprint and T-Mobile and T-Mobile’s 3G UMTS network will shut down by July 1. Finally Verizon will complete the shutdown of its 3G network by the end of the year.

Other carriers such as Cricket Boost Straight Talk and several Lifeline mobile service providers use AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile’s network and will be affected by the change.

This will affect older phones that run on 3G service and public safety officials say residents need to think ahead with this in mind.

According to The Washington Post iPhones older than the iPhone 6 will no longer work for calls and data including the 5 5C and 5S. Samsung Galaxy S4’s and older are 3G devices and newer models might need an update to work. The iPhone 6 was released in 2014 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 was released in 2013.

According to state police most people will be directly notified if the switch from 3G to 5G will affect them but individuals using phones exclusively designed to call 911 in case of emergencies only phones may not receive notification of this shutdown if they do not have active service.

Low-income individuals whose phones will no longer be supported can apply for service through the FCC’s Lifeline program at lifelinesupport.org.

Dana Brigandi the development marketing and programming director at the James V. Brown Library has been helping more and more seniors become familiar with their smart devices since 2013.

However she said that service concluded during the pandemic due to safety reasons and a lack of interest.

Brigandi said many seniors came into the library to expand knowledge already gained from family members introducing them to technology. She also said the pandemic forced a jump in the technology gap by 10 years.

“Now a certain demographic and age group were forced to learn these skills they might otherwise not know” Brigandi said.

Brigandi said many who are economically disadvantaged still have some kind of smart device — it is necessary in a world where one needs to apply online for benefits jobs and unemployment benefits. But that’s not something most people are thinking about until it affects them Brigandi said.

“‘Until my phone is shut off I’m not thinking about it'” Brigandi said of the mindset of those people."

What: Boston’s “Innovation District” Is Born

When: Jan. 4 2010

Where: South Boston

In his 2010 State of the City address former Mayor Thomas Menino touted an ambitious vision for turning the 1000-acre South Boston waterfront into Boston’s “Innovation District” by luring tech and life science companies from Cambridge and the suburbs.

That vision came alive on Jan. 25 2011 when Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced plans to relocate from a complex of buildings in Cambridge to a new 1.1 million-square-foot headquarters at The Fallon Co.’s Fan Pier development. Within three years of Menino’s address the neighborhood added 4000 jobs at 200 newly arrived companies according to city officials.

While office and multifamily projects spread across the neighborhood during the decade major life science development didn’t follow until 2019 when Cambridge-based Foundation Medicine leased 580000 square feet for a new headquarters at 400 Summer St.

“A new approach is called for on the waterfront one that is both more deliberate and more experimental. Together we should develop this thousand acres into a hub for knowledge workers and creative enterprises.”

But vaccine inequity remains high with 40% of the world population yet to receive a single jab.

The UN-led COVAX scheme has delivered one billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines one of the organizations that manage the program announced on Saturday.

The COVAX program was set up in 2020 to ensure global access to coronavirus vaccines particularly to poorer countries.

The program is backed by the World Health Organization (WHO) the Gavi vaccine alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

A 'key milestone'

""COVAX has delivered its first billionth dose of Covid-19 vaccines to 144 countries & territories across the world"" Gavi chief executive Seth Berkley tweeted. ""It's a key milestone in the largest and most rapid global vaccine rollout in history.""

The plane carrying the shipment with the one billionth dose arrived in Kigali Rwanda Saturday evening Berkley said.

""I felt proud but also humbled knowing how far we have to go to protect everyone and solve vaccine inequity"" he tweeted.

COVAX began delivering vaccines in February 2021 with the first doses reaching Ghana.

It has since supplied 144 countries and has received more than $10 billion (€880 million) in donations.

Vaccine deliveries below target

Vaccine supplies to low-income countries had long remained limited after the doses initially became available in December 2020.

This was because they were forced to compete with wealthier states buying shots from vaccine makers at a premium and hoarding them. Many countries even placed export restrictions on vaccines.

But shipments have exponentially increased in the last quarter Gavi said.

However the program has fallen far short of its initial plan of delivering two billion doses by the end of 2021.

COVAX's plan was also to only supply jabs procured directly by the program using the donors' funds. But of the one billion doses about one-third have been donated by rich nations.

This change in strategy led to delays as some donors asked for the shots to be sent to countries picked by them.

Vaccine inequity remains high

Despite the one billion milestone a vast majority of the population in poorer countries remain unvaccinated.

About 67% of the population in wealthy countries have been vaccinated compared with only 5% in poorer nations according to WHO data.

More than 40% of the world population has not received a single dose.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Thursday pointed out that more than 85% of people in Africa have yet to receive a single dose.

TROY MI — On Monday events in Troy will honor the life and legacy of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. In some U.S. cities however people plan to forgo the celebration of the federal holiday to take a stand in support of voting rights.

Last month the family of the late civil rights activist called on President Joe Biden and members of the U.S. Senate to either restore and expand voting rights in honor of King's legacy or skip the celebration of his namesake holiday. Fueling the King family’s call are at least 400 voter suppression bills introduced during the first five months of 2021 33 of which were put into law across 19 states according to a report by Insider citing data from the Voting Rights Lab.

Several bills were introduced in Michigan including proposed laws that would make it harder to vote without an ID and ban election officials from sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications. In response the Kings are demanding meaningful action on the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. They also asked Biden to ""ensure the Jim Crow filibuster doesn't stand in the way.""

RELATED: No MLK Jr. Day Without Action On Voting Rights King Family Says The Freedom to Vote Act would create a national standard for voting access overruling many restrictions passed or proposed in states. Meanwhile the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore and strengthen parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 after certain portions of the bill were struck down by two U.S. Supreme Court decisions.

While passed by thin margins in the U.S. House of Representatives both bills remain stuck in the Senate blocked primarily by Republican opposition. To encourage the Senate to pass both bills demonstrations are planned Saturday in Phoenix Arizona and Monday in Washington D.C. More than 100 grassroots organizations have joined the Kings’ call to action.

""Voting is an essential part of our democracy's infrastructure"" Arndrea Waters King said in a statement. Waters King is the wife of Martin Luther King III the son of the slain civil rights icon. “We cannot afford for it to crumble any further"" she added. Just days ahead of MLK Jr. Day Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta Tuesday to talk about the voting rights bills — bills Biden called a ""turning point."" In an excerpt of his speech released by the White House Biden said ""The next few days when these bills come to a vote will mark a turning point in this nation. Will we choose democracy over autocracy light over shadow justice over injustice? I know where I stand. I will not yield. I will not flinch. I will defend your right to vote and our democracy against all enemies foreign and domestic. And so the question is where will the institution of (the) United States Senate stand?""

NRF is a platform for imagining the future of retail. Discussions this year focused on topics such as technology in retail customer experience consumer loyalty and diversity and inclusion. The event witnessed seasoned business leaders such as IKEA Walmart and Rothy's discussing the industry's future with all addresses having a common thread - ""Sustainability in Retail."" NRF acknowledged sustainability in retail as one of the most critical areas. It also developed guidance for retailers to help them in their journey to achieve net-zero targets while considering the market trends.

The retail sector is nearest to the consumer and is thus affected drastically by consumer trends. With growing awareness of climate change retail buyers make a conscious choice of greener products. This external push from the market has become the driving force for retailers to deliver products that consider environmental and social impacts. Retailers are trying to innovate conventional business processes and end-products. Looking at the vast scope of retailers to influence consumption successful steps by some of the leading retailers discussed below can give us a peek into the future of sustainability in retail.

IKEA – Affordable Sustainability

IKEA considers sustainability as part of everyday life. Over the years it has launched various initiatives ranging from sustainable production to promoting circularity. The company intends to be a leader in the circular economy with an ambitious target of designing all its products using only renewables and recycled materials by 2030. The company has taken steps to buy back old IKEA products and launched a product range designed entirely with recycled materials. It is also trying to adopt sustainability in its most consumed raw material - wood. IKEA plans to use recycled wood in at least one-third of its wood range in 2030. In 2021 IKEA introduced energy-efficient LED bulbs and affordable air purifiers and plans to introduce recycled and renewable foams. Even its food business promotes sustainability by phasing out single-use plastic. In 2021 it started offering plant-based alternative foods with a considerably low climate footprint.

Walmart – Focus on Energy Consumption and Supplier Operations

Walmart has net-zero commitment for 2040. Two areas of focus for the organization to achieve its net-zero targets are - reducing energy consumption in operations and optimizing supply chain carbon footprints. According to GlobalData in 2020 Walmart stores had a 10.5% market share of global hypermarkets supermarkets and hard discounters. Given its humungous store area Walmart has enormous energy consumption. But according to Walmart only 5% of its carbon footprint comes from operations and the remaining 95% comes from an intricate supply chain. Walmart's supply chain consists of 183 US and 221 international distribution centers. The company focuses on reducing supplier carbon footprint through initiatives such as supplier engagement and measurement programs and involves diverse suppliers in its value chain. This strategy helps the company address both environmental and social aspects of sustainability.

Rothy's – Owning the Responsibility

Rothy's unlike Ikea and Walmart is smaller and has a distinct approach to sustainability. Rothy's is a vertically integrated company and most of the materials it uses are sustainable. Ownership of its supply chain allows Rothy's to produce materials such as algae-based foam natural rubber and marine plastic according to the demand resulting in lower waste generation. The company has set a goal for 2023 to achieve a completely circular product life cycle which means the products made from sustainable materials will also have an end-of-wear solution. It can help Rothy’s further reduce the carbon footprint of the products’ life cycle use.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5vcnRoZXJuZWNoby5jby51ay9uZXdzLzE5ODUyMDk2LmJvb3RzLWNvbmZpcm1zLWJpc2hvcC1hdWNrbGFuZC1zdG9yZS1zaHV0LXBlcm1hbmVudGx5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boots confirms Bishop Auckland store to shut permanently,"The store on Newgate Street in Bishop Auckland will permanently close on Saturday April 2 the national retailer has confirmed.

A spokesperson said shutting a store is “never an easy decision”.

When The Northern Echo asked Boots how the closure would affect pharmacy customers and staff it said people could use the pharmacy at its store on Bishop Auckland Retail Park.

The company did not say whether any jobs would be lost with the closure of the town centre store or if staff could be redeployed to other branches.

A Boots UK spokesperson said: “Closing a store is never an easy decision nor one we take lightly but as a business with a large estate we continually review our store locations to make sure they are where our customers need us most.

“We have taken the decision to close the store on Bishop Auckland Newgate Street store on 2nd April 2022.

“Our nearby store at Bishop Auckland Shopping Park is around a ten minute drive away and will continue to offer pharmacy services to our customers.”

There is a need to offer visitors a good shopping experience for them to return and at this moment in time we don’t have this

Durham County Councillor for Bishop Auckland Sam Zair who also sits on Bishop Auckland Town Centre and runs a café in the town said: “This is disappointing to hear that Boots are leaving our high street but I’m not surprised.

“I only hope that Boots can relocate their staff without making redundancies. “Another empty shop and another brand name leaving our high street is not good news for the tourism sector also.

“There is a need to offer visitors a good shopping experience for them to return and at this moment in time we don’t have this.”

Boots was one of the first retailers to start trading on the out-of-town retail park towards the end of 2012.

At the time there were mixed opinions on the retail development with supporters believing it would regenerate derelict industrial land and objections worried about how it would hit traders in the town centre.

Walmart appears to be venturing into the metaverse with plans to create its own cryptocurrency and collection of non-fungible tokens or NFTs. The big-box retailer filed several new trademarks late last month that indicate its intent to make and sell virtual goods including electronics home decorations toys sporting goods and personal care products. In a separate filing Walmart said it would offer users a virtual currency as well as NFTs. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Walmart filed the applications on Dec. 30.

In total seven separate applications have been submitted. In a statement Walmart said it is ""continuously exploring how emerging technologies may shape future shopping experiences."" It declined to comment on the specific trademark filings. ""We are testing new ideas all the time"" the company added. ""Some ideas become products or services that make it to customers. And some we test iterate and learn from.""

""[The filings are] super intense"" said Josh Gerben a trademark attorney. ""There's a lot of language in these which shows that there's a lot of planning going on behind the scenes about how they're going to address cryptocurrency how they're going to address the metaverse and the virtual world that appears to be coming or that's already here."" Gerben said that ever since Facebook announced it was changing its company name to Meta signaling its ambitions beyond social media businesses have been rushing to figure out how they will fit into a virtual world.

The retailer sought several new trademarks in December that show it intends to make and sell virtual goods such as electronics decor toys sporting goods and personal-care products.

The applications which were first reported by CNBC represent a significant step for the retail giant as it studies how to participate in the metaverse a virtual world that blends aspects of digital technologies. Walmart in August advertised a position to develop “the digital currency strategy and product roadmap” while identifying “crypto-related investment and partnerships” according to a job posting on the company’s website.

The applications were among a flurry the company filed on Dec. 30 including three under “Walmart Connect” — the name of the company’s existing digital advertising venture — for a financial exchange for virtual currency and advertising. Applications also were filed for “Verse to Store” “Verse to Curb” and “Verse to Home” for shopping services. It’s also seeking trademarks to apply the Walmart name and “fireworks” logo to heath-care services and education in virtual and augmented reality.

A Walmart representative didn’t immediately comment on the filings.

All of the applications were filed indicating that the company intends to use them but has not yet begun doing so. The trademarks wouldn’t be registered until they are in actual use.

Walmart’s cryptocurrency plans were the subject of a high-profile hoax in September when a fake announcement caused a short-lived surge in Litecoin a relatively obscure cryptocurrency. According to the faked news release Walmart would start letting its customers pay with Litecoin.

Even so Walmart has continued to explore capabilities in that realm. In October the Bentonville Arkansas-based retailer started a pilot program in which shoppers can buy Bitcoin at Coinstar kiosks in some of its U.S. stores. The test with Coinstar which is known for the machines that let customers exchange U.S. coins for paper bills or gift cards includes 200 kiosks in Walmart stores.

In early December Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said at an analyst conference that the company was open to allowing shoppers to pay in cryptocurrency if customers demand it but the company didn’t see a need to rush out any capabilities.

Hong

Walmart has filed several new trademarks hoping to produce and sell virtual goods.

Separate filings show the retailer also plans to create its own cryptocurrency and NFTs.

The retailer joins a slew of businesses rushing to capitalize on Web3 and the metaverse.

Walmart will join Facebook Nike Ralph Lauren Bumble Disney and a string of other companies with plans to claim their own corner of the metaverse.

The retailer the largest private employer in the US quietly filed several trademark applications in late December which described extensive plans to sell virtual merchandise. CNBC was first to report on the applications.

Walmart is directing its attention to the virtual world like many others including Facebook which rebranded itself last year to Meta and publicly announced its goals to invest and expand into the metaverse a virtual space where people can interact digitally using avatars.

According to a filing Walmart lists a variety of virtual goods it plans to sell including electronics appliances apparel home goods toys and personal care products. A separate filing shows the company's interest in creating its own cryptocurrency payment method and collection of non-fungible tokens or NFTs.

According to the US Patent and Trademark Office Walmart filed seven separate applications on December 30.

""Walmart is continuously exploring how emerging technologies may shape future shopping experiences"" the company said in an email to Insider. ""We don't have anything further to share today but it's worth noting we routinely file trademark applications as part of the innovation process.""

Despite many companies' plans for the metaverse business leaders remain unsure of how to create a fully-fledged metaverse. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have said that the metaverse could be an $8 trillion opportunity but the challenge would be getting consumers to buy into it. However Walmart saw its online sales thrive in 2021 with sales at $11.1 billion in its third quarter according to a Digital Commerce 360 report which could prove useful for Walmart's metaverse ambitions.

A number of apparel-based retailers have already begun making their own metaverse experiences. Gap launched its first-ever NFT art collection last week with digital art pieces starting at around $9 a piece. Nike has spent over three years on patents outlining digital avatars to ""cryptokicks"" with the company establishing its Metaverse Studio and acquiring digital sneaker company RTFKT in December.

Other apparel retailers like Urban Outfitters Ralph Lauren and Abercrombie & Fitch have also filed trademarks in recent weeks with intent to open their own version of a virtual store trademark attorney Josh Gerben told CNBC on Sunday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEvMTYvMjI4ODcwMTEvd2FsbWFydC1tZXRhdmVyc2UtbmZ0LWNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart is getting serious about the metaverse,"Walmart appears to be getting ready for a leap into the metaverse. Recent trademark applications indicate the company is looking to establish its own NFTs and cryptocurrency according to a report from CNBC.

The retail giant filed for several trademarks on December 30th suggesting plans to start selling virtual goods including electronics toys appliances sporting equipment apparel home decor and more as noted by CNBC. There’s mention of offering customers a digital currency as well as the opportunity to buy and sell NFTs. Meanwhile another application details possible “physical fitness training services” and “classes in the field of health and nutrition” that could take place in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality environments (VR) — the company made a separate filing for the use of its name and logo in VR and AR.

Walmart also filed trademarks for “Verse to Home” “Verse to Curb” and “Verse to Store”

As pointed out by Bloomberg Walmart also filed trademarks for the names “Verse to Home” “Verse to Curb” and “Verse to Store” a hint that Walmart may be preparing a virtual shopping experience (that hopefully doesn’t look like the one created for the company in 2017). The filings are publicly available on the US Patent and Trademark Office’s site some of which are listed under the name “Walmart Connect” the retailer’s digital advertising endeavor. You can access the filings by searching for “Walmart” or “Walmart Connect” on the Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)."

But it turns out that several of the original Disney movies feature a number of recycled animation sequences. Yes you've probably watched the same animation more than once because of Disney's little hack. Check out the video below or see for yourself by signing up for Disney Plus and spending the weekend binging your favourite animations.

The YouTube video by Cartoon Hangover has racked up over 2 million views since it was posted in 2017. It reveals several repeated sequences taken from the likes of Snow White Bambi and 101 Dalmations using side-by-side shots to show almost identical animations.

The video also features a quote from an ex-Disney animator Floyd Norman who explains the recycled animations were ""done to save time and save money"". However Norman goes on to reveal he didn't think it did what it set out to because it was ""more of a hassle to dig this old footage out of the archive"".

The video has picked up thousands of comments. ""It's like Bambi's mum never died she kept showing up in other movies"" one person wrote while someone else said ""This is why all the Disney movies of that era are jumbled in my head. I thought I just had a bad memory"".

So next time you're watching old Disney films be sure to keep a close eye on the animation. If you're working on your own animation see the 12 principles of Disney animations and take a look at our roundup of the best laptops for animation.

From the Haunted Mansion to Space Mountain to Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance there is something for everyone to enjoy. Shopping is another great way to spend time at the Disney Resorts; with incredible stores throughout the Parks and Disney Springs many Guests notice a drop in the quality of merchandise at the Walt Disney Resort.

Many Guests are noticing a drop in the quality of Disney merch and the Disney experience in general. From the controversial Disney Genie and Lightning Lane systems to lackluster merchandise it seems that the Disney experience may be on a decline. A recent Reddit thread talked about these issues; see the full post below from u/BiteRhodeIslamd:

Disney Has Lost All Quality Control

User u/boxdude commented:

I usually defend Disney but I am beginning to be convinced they have an issue with the merchandise division. Anectdotally It feels like something has slipped and your experience is just one of several we are hearing about. I wonder if the pandemic and the layoffs that came with it are the major drivers of that.

User u/Aristophan said:

I feel like something started slipping before that. There is such a sharp change in quality in the ears – right about at the release of the “Briar rose gold” ones (not the original all-sequin ones but the ones still available now).

User u/oscarjoserodrigo asked if something like this was worthy of a discount:

Eesh… Did you show that to someone? That’s at least worthy of a discount.

User u/Minnienurse said:

When I went in December I shopped around for some 50th anniversary memorabilia to bring home but I left each store empty handed. Not impressed at all.

User u/ChrisC1234 talked about how disappointing the 50th-anniversary merch was:

I was there in November. You’re right about none of the 50th anniversary stuff being “wow”. The only stuff that I ended up buying were some 50th magnets (I at least wanted SOMETHING) and a bunch of the 50th anniversary reproduction stuff.

Many in the thread talked about how these issues might be attributed to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus has affected all Disney Parks and Resorts worldwide with Hong Kong Disneyland announcing an at least two-week closure. Disneyland Pairs was forced to cancel its New Year’s Eve party and many wonder if the U.S. Parks are next on the list for closure.

This issue is demonstrated further when looking at the merch in Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge. Recently Disney Guests and Star Wars fans have been livid at what Disney has done to its Star Wars-themed merchandise. Currently Disney is no longer giving out carrying cases for its lightsabers or buildable droids as advertised on the store page instead opting for cheap plastic bags.

Another issue being brought up by Guests is portion sizes and less appealing food across the Walt Disney World property. Many Guests report smaller meal sizes and less satisfying snacks attributing this to either COVID-19 or a general lack of care from Disney. Many Guests blame these issues on Bob Chapek the controversial new Disney CEO who took over the company in early 2020. Many Guests see Chapek as a money-focused and budget-cutting businessman more than a creative visionary to lead the Disney Parks.

Posted:

'A Celebration of Festival of the Lion King' is facing significant staffing issues as the current surge of COVID-19 continues to force some Walt Disney World Cast Members to remain home.

Today there are only four shows scheduled according to My Disney Experience at 1pm 2pm 4pm and 5pm. There usually are eight shows on a Saturday.

Tomorrow also sees a significant decrease with only five shows scheduled instead of eight.

Tuesday January 18 appears to be the hardest hit with just three shows scheduled at 10am 11am and 12pm.

Check My Disney Experience for the latest showtimes and changes.

Disney recently adjusted its COVID quarantine guidelines for cast members at Walt Disney World to follow the latest guidelines from the CDC which reduces isolation from 10 to 5 days and requires the use of a mask for 5 days on return to work. However even with this change keeping enough cast available to operate the parks at current capacity is difficult."

The In the Heights star 27 shared a photo of herself in costume from the upcoming HBO Max movie Batgirl in which she stars as the titular character. Grace posted the image on Instagram Friday showing off her sleek ensemble.

In the shot she rocks a royal-blue suit with the Batgirl logo across her chest. Her gold cape billows behind her and she also wears a black mask.

She captioned the picture with a quote from Batgirl: Year One written by Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon.

She wrote ""'I use their expectations against them. That will be their weakness. Not mine. Let them all underestimate me… And when their guard is down and their pride is rising let me kick their butts.' - Batgirl Year One 🦇 #Batgirl.""

Grace's post comes six months after she landed the role in July 2021. At the time the actress shared the news on Twitter writing that she was ""BEYOND EXCITED to embody Barbara Gordon your #Batgirl!""

She added ""I cannot believeeee what I'm writing rn… THANK YOU DC for welcoming [me] to the family! I'm ready to give her all I've got!""

Batgirl marks Grace's second major film role. She previously starred as Nina Rosario in the Jon M. Chu-directed musical In the Heights.

Grace joins a string of other actresses who have worn the Batgirl cape in the past. The role of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl has previously been played by Alicia Silverstone in 1997's Batman & Robin as well as Yvonne Craig in the 1960s TV series.

Warner Bros has been one of the top studios in Hollywood over the decades churning out hit films one after the one. However the production house has also been associated with numerous controversies over the years.

There have been numerous such instances in recent times and fans are so unhappy that they are venting out against the studio on social media. Right from the removal of Ray Fisher from The Flash and Johnny Depp from Fantastic Beasts 3 the exit of Ben Affleck as Batman and the latest episode of Peacemaker there were multiple reasons. The fans expressed their displeasure by trending 'Boycott Warner Bros' on Twitter.

Netizens trend 'Boycott Warner Bros' on Twitter vent out against the studio

While the origin of the 'Boycott Warner Bros' or 'Boycott WB' trend was not clear the reasons were not one. Some were unhappy over Ray Fisher who played the superhero Cyborg being dismissed from the upcoming The Flash following his accusations of racism against Justice League director Joss Whedon who had replaced Zack Synder.

WB fired Ray Fisher for standing up against their racial abuse. #BoycottWB — Stallion #RestoreTheSnyderVerse (@Spagggs)

It seems there was a spike in the tweets after Ray Fisher accused Geoff Johns writer of numerous DC films and series of being a racist. This was amid news of the latter's association with Flashpoint Beyond.

Geoff Johns is still a racist.



A>E — Ray Fisher (@ray8fisher)

Some also used the hashtag 'Restore the Snyderverse' along with their 'boycott' messages hoping to see an extension of Zack Synder's version of the DC characters after Zack Snyder's Justice League also known as 'Snyder's Cut.'

Some of the other comments were of the studio not extending their associations with numerous actors and directors. One posted an image of Ben Affleck and Christopher Nolan who worked with the studio on The Dark Knight franchise. Ben Affleck quitting as Batman was another reason for one of the fans.

Among their other grievances was the ongoing legal dispute between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Some were not pleased over the former being removed from Fantastic Beast but the latter still being a part of Aquaman 2.

The latest series Peacemaker too landed in a controversial zone. One stated that the character who gets hired by the government to restore peace even if drastic measures be used as 'problematic and that was the reason to boycott the studio.

Watched the first episode of PEACEMAKER and I thought it was pretty great.



Sadly however the main character is #problematic and therefore I refuse to dig into the nuances of why he operates this way within the narrative and therefore have no choice but to boycott Warner Bros. — Josh McCormack (@JoshMcCormack2)

Gen Z beware: The 2000s were rife with generally accepted racism homophobia being used as punchlines slut shaming and other such wonderful cultural tidbits. While Hollywood is still filled with cultural missteps it's a much more diverse and nuanced place than when I was growing up in the early millennium. Here are some TV and film moments from the 2000s that hopefully would never make it onscreen today.

1. Michael Oher The Blind Side (2009): Portrayingas the dumb beneficiary of white saviors in(2009):

While based on a heartwarming true story of a Black teenager being adopted by a white family and going on to become an NFL star and Superbowl champion the movie was a well-acted white savior play. Firstly by cutting out all the reasons Oher was under-educated (lack of consistent schooling due to homelessness and foster care) they made it look like he was a savant rather than a normal (well obviously above-average intelligence considering his career plays) kid who just needed consistency and educational opportunities. Secondly as Oher himself protested in his 2014 memoir: ""I could not figure out why the director chose to show me as someone who had to be taught the game of football. Whether it was S.J. moving around ketchup bottles or Leigh Anne explaining to me what blocking is about I watched those scenes thinking 'No that's not me at all! I've been studying — really studying — the game since I was a kid!'"" Jim Spellman / WireImage

2. Asians in Mean Girls (2004):

I stan Mean Girls and my queen Tina Fey gets so many things on POINT in that seminal sleepover film. Soooo why do the ""cool Asians"" in Mean Girls have nonsense Korean names (Trang Pak is not a real Korean or Vietnamese name) but speak Vietnamese? Paramount Pictures

3. Joey's inner homophobe in Friends (2002):

Sensitive jovial Joey is a wannabe actor in New York City which means he should be surrounded by plenty of queer people and culture. However when Ross and Rachel hire a gay nanny Joey reveals a blatant bigotry that the show treats as funny and normal. The problem is that Friends didn't point out his homophobia as a problem but as a joke punctuated by laugh tracks. David Hume Kennerly / Getty Images

4. Shaming men for expressing emotion in John Tucker Must Die:

Remember when they snuck ladies' man John Tucker estrogen pills in retaliation for cheating and it somehow made him so emotional he started crying during a basketball game? Not only does the movie make a punchline out of a man having an emotional breakdown but they also tie it to being ""womanly."" Apparently estrogen makes you say things like ""I'm anxious and bloated; do my thighs look fat in these shorts"" and ""My nipples hurt."" Hmm. Evan Agostini / Getty Images

5. Patrolling teenage daughter's virginity in What Women Want (2000):

Nick (Mel Gibson)'s character undergoes a transformation when he gets the magical ability to read women's minds. While this movie isn't as bad as it could be considering the era the lesson Nick teaches his daughter that the only thing older boys could want from her is sex is a bit outdated. Vince Bucci / Getty Images

6. Samantha Jones dating a Black man in SATC:

Samantha is a boss bitch but every single second of her brief affair with a Black man on SATC is cringeworthy. From ""talking Black"" to the reverse racism plotline of portraying Samantha — who rarely even interacts with people of color in one of the most diverse cities in the world — as the REAL open-minded one... Too much oblivious racism too little time. HBO

7. Dukes of Hazzard Confederate flag car (2005):

Warner Brothers' 2005 film kept the original show's General Lee car with a Confederate flag. What a joke. Gabriel Bouys / AFP via Getty Images

8. Rob Schneider's Chinese wedding minister in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry (2007):

So many homophobic and racist jokes abound but Rob Schneider's Chinese wedding minister is one of the most egregious. Lester Cohen / WireImage

9. When Ted Mosby rejected a girl because she used to be overweight HIMYM (2007):

Ted Mosby's had a LOT of terrible moments but this one aged particularly poorly. The cherry on top of an ongoing series of fat jokes is when he breaks up with a nice girl just because she USED to be overweight. Stephen Lovekin / Getty Images

10. The overweight moment in White Chicks (2004):

Are we really supposed to believe Jennifer Carpenter's tiny behind is ""Cellulite Sally""? Yes it's supposed to mock their supposedly silly anxieties; taken seriously that movie (one of my favorite movies) is a field strewn with non-PC land mines. But it's also a prime example of the many anxieties of rich white young women created by a toxic culture of body shaming. Kevin Winter / Getty Images

11. The entire premise of Shallow Hal (2001):

The entire premise of Shallow Hal is that Jack Black has standards that are ""too high"" so he gets spelled to see larger chicks as hot thin women. To learn about his own shallowness. WTF?! Is the lesson that big women need love too? Or that they need to be thin to be attractive?! So many problems here. Vince Bucci / Getty Images

12. Filming the naked exchange student without her consent in American Pie:

Giphy / Via giphy.com

Remember when the guys secretly planted a camera and filmed the foreign exchange student naked without her permission? That did not age well.

13. ""Fat Monica"" from Friends:

Fat-shaming pervaded many aspects of early 2000s films and television from Love Actually to Friends. When being fat is the joke's sole punchline it's not very funny. Monica's jadedness supposedly comes from her secret past as a fat kid and every scene where Courteney Cox dons a fat suit is pretty cringeworthy. Nbc / NBCUniversal via Getty Images

14. Barney secretly filming his sexcapades:

Giphy / Via giphy.com

This is ongoing throughout the whole show; Barney brags about secretly filming his conquests and having a collection of homemade pornos. It's a scary thought that some guy may have filmed you having sex without your consent.

15. White savior syndrome in Bring It On: All Or Nothing (2006):

Here's another nostalgic movie that was so problematic. Hayden Panettiere plays White Savior to a group of South Central cheerleaders because it takes a blonde from Pacific Vista to teach them how to crump and lead them to victory at Rihanna's dance-off. Universal / Â©Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection

16. Teaching women they need to be dumb to be sexy in The House Bunny (2008):

giphy / Via giphy.com

The entire premise of the movie is that you should change to get boys to like you and apparently boys only like women who are not too smart too slutty too dumb or too outspoken.

17. Michael consistently getting away with sexual harassment in The Office:

Giphy / Via giphy.com

Michael Scott is supposed to be the super cringeworthy boss we all love to hate but the show makes it OK that he sexually harasses women all the time both above and below him on the corporate ladder often egregiously.

What happens next?,"The state’s only operating landfill in Coventry recently expanded by 50 acres providing about 20 more years of space. After that no one knows where Vermont’s trash will go.

COVENTRY — In early December the driver of a tractor-trailer made his way down a dirt road carved into the side of a brand new 14-acre cell — the newest phase of Vermont’s only operating landfill.

At the bottom the driver dislodged the body of the truck from the cab and hooked it up to a lift which hoisted it diagonally into the air. Discarded objects from the everyday lives of Hyde Park residents tumbled from its opened back doors.

A new 51-acre expansion makes the landfill — what locals not-so-lovingly call “Mount Casella” — a 129-acre behemoth. It accepts the majority of trash produced in the state and it’s a well-oiled machine.

Like cars on a model train set trucks descended into the new cell every few minutes to lift empty and drive away. Bulldozers and trash compactors intercepted the flow spreading and compressing the mounds of plastic splintered wood and dried septic sludge to make room for years’ worth of trash to come.

Casella Waste Systems Inc. which owns the facility plans to build three more cells like this one. When they’re full around 22 years from now no one’s sure where the state’s waste will go.

“There are site limitations with future expansions at Coventry” said Matt Chapman director of the Department of Environmental Conservation’s waste management division. “You have the road on one side the airport on the other the Black River surrounding it and the wetland complex surrounding it on the other sides.”

The state “basically serves the function as a regulator in this capacity” Chapman said. On a broad scale the state does some planning — determining how to divert and lessen waste for example — but the state does not have a long-term plan that outlines where waste will go when Coventry’s landfill is full or how it will be handled.

Casella could theoretically expand one more time. To do that it would need to excavate an old unlined section of the landfill — otherwise known as Nadeau’s dump — and move it to a new lined area which would be filled with old and new trash. The project would be called Phase V.

Constructing that project would be incredibly challenging Chapman said partly because it is located next to a wetland.

“That means when you start digging into it you’re likely to have wetter saturated soils and waste material in it” he said. “So it’s gonna be smelly — there are going to be all sorts of challenges.”

That section would provide 3 million yards of capacity for new trash said Jeremy Labbe general manager at Casella compared with the 13 million yards included in the new expansion.

Even if Casella decides to move ahead with those plans and gains the necessary approval Labbe said the expansion would provide only “another few years of life.”

Labbe said it’s impossible to say this far out what other disposal options could emerge on the company’s land in Coventry which totals more than 1000 acres.

Meanwhile members of the grassroots organization DUMP or Don’t Undermine Memphremagog’s Purity have tried to limit the landfill’s impact on residents and the environment for years. The group formed to fight the expansion and they pushed back against the landfill’s expansion for nearly a year and a half.

They have argued that its location near wetlands and Lake Memphremagog makes it the wrong place to dispose of the state’s waste. The group reached a settlement agreement with Casella in November 2019 stipulating that Casella would increase odor monitoring measures provide DUMP with copies of permit applications and reports submitted to the state and other measures.

Several members of DUMP told VTDigger they are calling for the Legislature to require the Agency of Natural Resources to create a plan for the future of solid waste in Vermont by 2025.

According to members of DUMP residents of Coventry are tired of hosting the dumping grounds for the rest of the state.

Significant obstacles

Vermont has around 22 years to figure out what to do with its waste. While that sounds like an ample amount of time solutions can get complicated fast.

Vermonters should not be worried Chapman said. Garbage is “an interstate commodity” and Vermont is better poised in that respect than many other states in southern New England where landfill capacity is tighter.

“Having said that I think we should all be cognizant of what’s going on” in Coventry he said.

The state is relying on another entity — either a private company or a municipality — to propose a new facility such as a landfill or an incinerator also known as a waste-to-energy facility Chapman said.

Landfills are “highly regulated highly engineered environments” Chapman said and opening another one is a multi-year process and a significant financial challenge — one estimate puts the cost between $300000 and $800000 per acre.

Many of the problems cited by DUMP members are linked to the magnitude of the 129-acre facility along with its location. But economically according to Chapman it’s hard to make something smaller work.

“What happens behind the scenes is an incredible upfront capital investment that a company or a municipality needs to make in order to site design permit and then ultimately construct the landfill” he said. “It’s a really hard thing to do.”

Two municipal solid waste management districts in Sheldon and Hartland have considered hosting small landfills — though Chapman said neither plan to move forward anytime soon.

These conceptual sites “face significant obstacles to being viable for operation” the report said.

Sheldon’s Northwest Vermont Solid Waste Management District Landfill site has retained a conceptual design permit from the state according to the Report on Landfill Operation in the State prepared by the Department of Environmental Conservation in January 2021.

Located on a 155-acre parcel in the northwestern corner of the state the landfill would be 13 acres and hold trash for 16 years at a rate of 20000 tons per year. In 2020 alone the Coventry landfill accepted a total 496170 tons of trash.

Hartland’s proposed site which would be managed by the Greater Upper Valley Solid Waste Management District “was long regarded as a technically and environmentally promising location for the development of a regional lined landfill” according to the landfill operations report.

The district voluntarily revoked its standing certification before it expired in 2015 because of anticipated operational costs.

“The previously issued conceptual design permit was for an operational capacity of 50000 tons per year; however it was estimated that 75000 to 125000 tons per year would need to be accepted in order for this landfill to make economic sense with consideration of potential capital and operating costs” the report said.

Generally speaking capacity for landfills in New England is shrinking Chapman said.

“There’s definitely a pinch from that perspective and tightness in the regional disposal markets” he said.

Another option Chapman said would be to follow the lead of southern New England and ship waste to other states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. Or Vermont could push forward and accomplish an age-old goal: shrinking the amount of waste consumers produce.

“To some degree there’s limits to what we can do or what we do do with respect to consumer behavior” Chapman said.

Reducing waste

Though the state has designed a plan to reduce waste called the Materials Management Plan it has yet to show meaningful progress.

In 2019 the Coventry landfill accepted the most household trash from Vermonters in any year since 2004. The same year the state created the plan which sets goals for the amount of reduction disposal and diversion that will take place in the next several years. For example it calls for a 10% reduction in the amount of annual waste generated — down to about 606000 tons generated per year — by 2024.

“However Vermonters continue to generate more waste each year with per capita waste disposal up 8% since 2014 and diversion remaining at (around) 35%” according to a 2021 Biennial Report on Solid Waste created for the Legislature.

“More work needs to be done to meet the diversion and disposal goals” of the 2019 Materials Management Plan it said.

Evidence suggests the Universal Recycling Law — which banned food scraps from landfills and single-use products from stores and restaurants on July 1 2020 — is working. Food scrap collection has increased every year since 2016. Since 2014 Vermont has seen a 10% increase in recycling and 72% of mandated recyclables are recycled the report said.

Still it likely isn’t enough to meet the goals outlined in the Materials Management Plan.

“Even with improved recycling food donation and composting rates waste generation in Vermont increased 11% from 2016 to 2017” the Materials Management Plan said. “Unfortunately this reversed decreasing disposal trends seen in 2015 and 2016.”

Data from 2020 shows some progress. Vermonters produced about 625000 tons of municipal waste according to the state’s 2020 Diversion and Disposal Report. That’s 6.8% less than Vermonters produced in 2019 which the state attributes to ripple effects from the pandemic.

“Periods of economic downturn often correspond with decreases in waste generation” the 2020 report said. “As the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered many businesses and institutions waste recycling and organics from these commercial sectors dropped off and haulers reported an increase in the amount of these materials collected from the residential sector.”

Last week state Sen. Chris Bray D-Addison introduced S.236 an “extended producer responsibility” bill which he said would hold manufacturers responsible for reducing their waste.

“There always is a cost to handling trash” Bray said. “If the manufacturer is going to have a role to play in paying part of that cost then they may think differently about the packaging being used.”

The bill would encourage manufacturers to shift to materials that can be more easily recycled use more recycled products in the materials and reduce the total materials used in the product and its packaging Bray said.

In 2020 Vermont sent around 74000 tons of household waste and 17000 tons of construction waste to facilities in New Hampshire or New York.

While the Coventry landfill does not take household waste from other states it accepts construction materials sludge from sewage treatment plants asbestos ash contaminated soil medical waste and more.

Planning and community impact

One of the biggest hurdles for prospective landfill operators is community opposition according to the 2021 Report on Landfill Operation in the State.

Locals and members of DUMP say their opposition is backed by good reason particularly because the landfill places an outsized burden on a small number of people — and an international body of water.

The Black River runs to the west of the landfill and empties into Lake Memphremagog a drinking water source for more than 175000 Canadians. The lake’s South Bay is located several thousand feet to the east.

Odors also present a problem. Bob Fortunati a Coventry resident who lives on a ridge overlooking the landfill said the smell near his home can be unbearable. He moved into his house in 1983 back when the landfill was small and handled only local waste.

Now the landfill has grown to “something bigger than a small town like Coventry really is capable of even comprehending” he said.

In an essay written before Casella expanded Henry Coe a leader of DUMP wrote that one of the group’s main points of opposition is the “social and environmental injustice of transporting 70% of Vermont’s garbage long distances from areas of greater population and affluence which generate such waste through formerly quiet small communities to a remote community at the source of a major international drinking water body.”

Canadian officials have already detected trace amounts of the toxic chemical group PFAS in a body of water connected to the lake. The news sparked concern from locals on both sides of the border that the contamination may be coming from the Newport wastewater treatment facility which treated leachate from the landfill though that has not been confirmed by state officials.

A February 2020 report from Vermont’s Department of Conservation shows that water exiting wastewater treatment facilities in Montpelier and Newport which both treated leachate from the Coventry landfill at the time contained significantly higher amounts of PFAS or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances than other wastewater treatment facilities.

Chapman said the facility is monitored frequently and extensively. At least once a year state officials conduct a “canoe survey” in the wetlands among other quarterly inspections and an annual third-party report. While other landfills in the state now closed have received complaints that have caused the state to deny permit renewals “we haven’t seen similar levels of complaints or issues at Coventry” he said.

The environmental concerns have prompted DUMP to call for the state to play a bigger role in solid waste management.

DUMP members Peggy Stevens Teresa Gerade and Coe outlined their suggested plan in a joint statement to VTDigger. It would include an evaluation of new waste technologies and “of potential regional landfill sites close to areas of greatest population density whose geology land use ground and surface waters are found appropriate for siting.”

Communities in the state that produce the most waste should handle it locally or regionally they wrote and waste disposal should “not be left to the initiative of the private waste industry.” The state should work to site any forthcoming landfills away from waterways wetlands public drinking water sources or wildlife management areas they said.

The Legislature they said should “oversee and approve the development of an updated set of criteria rules and regulations for landfill siting operation and leachate pretreatment management requiring input of local and state level public agencies.”

Bray the state senator from Addison County chairs the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy. In the past legislators have had some conversations about siting another landfill he said but not in the context of Coventry’s eventual closure.

Other issues — Covid-19 the state’s new Climate Action Plan the opioid crisis the housing shortage — have taken precedence over an issue that’s decades away. What will happen when the “day of reckoning” built into the landfill’s eventual closure eventually arrives is still an open question Bray said.

Labbe general manager for Casella thinks the state needs a broader plan for solid waste. Whatever comes next he said the company wants to be involved.

“I think at some point in time that’s their call” he said. “But we’re going to do what we can to secure disposal because we need that opportunity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZjc3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAxLzE2L2ZhcXMtbmV3LWxvY2FsLWN1cmJzaWRlLWNvbGxlY3Rpb24tZm9vZC13YXN0ZS12ZW50dXJhLWNvdW50eS85MDU2ODkzMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eco-tip: FAQs on new local curbside collection of food waste,"David Goldstein

Special to Ventura County Star

Over the past two weeks I have received several inquiries about California's new food waste recycling law that took effect Jan. 1. The law requires residents and businesses to recycle their food waste and other organics.

Here are my answers to some of the most common questions:

Why did this new program start?

To combat climate change and conserve resources the state Legislature in 2014 passed Senate Bill 1383 setting deadlines for cities and counties to implement monitor and enforce programs to reduce landfilling of organics.

Organics are anything derived from living matter including food and yard clippings. In landfills organics decompose without oxygen emitting a powerful climate-changing gas called methane. Aerated composting emits far less methane.

Is curbside food waste recycling available in my area?

If you're unsure call the phone number on your refuse bill. Call center staff will ask for your address and give you information specific to your area.

Should I bag my food scraps?

In cities served by Harrison Industries' trash collection — Ventura Camarillo Ojai and Fillmore — residents should keep food scraps in a bag and put it in their yard waste cart now called an “organics” cart. The bagging allows trash haulers to keep food waste separate from yard clippings and other organic waste taken to local composting facilities which are not yet permitted to accept food.

Oxnard residents are also asked to bag their kitchen waste.

Residents in cities served by Athens Services or Waste Management — Thousand Oaks Santa Paula Moorpark and Simi Valley — should put the scraps directly into the organics cart — no bags.

What happens to the food scraps?

Because composting facilities in Ventura County do not yet have permits to process food waste scraps collected here are hauled to businesses outside in the county most commonly in Kern County. The compost and other soil products are sold to farmers landscapers and gardeners.

Agromin expects to open an organics processing facility in Oxnard later this year. Residential and commercial food waste will be mashed and sold as animal feed or sent to other facilities to make compost or biofuels.

Agromin also expects to have a permit to accept food waste at its Limoneira composting facility though upgrading the operation to required standards could over a year.

How much is this going to cost me?

Some cities including Thousand Oaks and Santa Paula have newly negotiated contracts with a refuse hauling company that already include organics recycling in rates.

Other cities have so far managed to add the service without rate increases but this added recycling is expensive and likely to affect rates in the future.

If bagging food scraps proves successful it could hold down the recycling cost in areas using that program. With bagging food can be pulled out of the mix at sorting centers so only a small portion of the waste in organics carts needs to be hauled to distant operations that have a full solid waste facility permit. This enables companies to recycle yard clippings and lumber locally.

When Agromin’s Limoneira facility begins accepting yard waste with food waste costs may decline as all material will be locally recycled.

Who is going to buy all this compost?

Farmers balance the cost of buying and spreading compost against the agronomic benefit which doesn't always pencil out. Farms are not expected to buy enough so the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) has required cities and counties to increase their purchase of compost mulch or bioenergy in the coming years.

Residents can keep public costs lower and benefit from organics recycling programs by buying locally produced mulch and compost.

The city will not accept bulk trash collection requests during this suspension and residents are asked not to place additional bulk trash or yard waste bags at the curb.

According to a Facebook post from the city the decision was made due to ongoing staffing shortages.

""This suspension will allow Waste Management to catch up on collection of items already at the curbside while working to hire and train new staff"" the city's Facebook post reads.

The city said on Monday that due to the continued staffing shortages the Waste Management Division was at least one week behind on bulk waste and bagged yard waste collection.

Issues with trash collection in the city have been going on since at least August 2021 when city officials said they were working to recruit additional staff and get them into the field as soon as possible.

He was 82.

Frazier was born in Spiro Okla. on Oct. 27 1939 and raised in Bakersfield Calif. At age 12 he was already writing songs and won a talent competition hosted by Ferlin Husky. By age 14 Frazier was recording for Capitol Records. In 1960 Frazier had his first success as a songwriter when “Alley Oop” became a pop hit for the Hollywood Argyles. Three years later he moved to Nashville.

In 1967 the Frazier-penned “There Goes My Everything” recorded by Jack Greene was named song of the year by the Country Music Association.

Frazier also found success co-writing songs with A.L. “Doodle” Owens including Charley Pride‘s first No. 1 Billboard Hot Country Songs hit 1969’s “All I Have to Offer You (Is Me).” Pride also had No. 1 country hits with the Frazier/Owens collaborations “(I’m So) Afraid of Losing You Again” “I Can’t Believe That You’ve Stopped Loving Me” and “Then Who Am I.”

Connie Smith and George Jones were also among those who recorded several of Frazier’s hits such as Jones’ 1967 hit “If My Heart Had Windows.” (Jones also recorded an entire album of Frazier’s songs on Sings the Songs of Dallas Frazier.) Among the Frazier-penned Smith recordings are “Ain’t Had No Lovin’” “Run Away Little Tears” “Ain’t Love a Good Thing” and more.

Another’s of Frazier’s best-known songs “Elvira” was previously recorded by Rodney Crowell before it became a smash hit for the Oak Ridge Boys in 1981. The group’s recording of the song earned the Country Music Association’s single of the year honor.

“I’ve noticed this all my life in writing songs there’s a thing called feel and it’s magic when you get ahold of it” Frazier told journalist Tom Roland in a 2018 interview. “It can make or break a record. You can have a great song and all but if it doesn’t have that feel it just doesn’t do anything. ‘Elvira’ had the feel. And The Oaks what a tremendous cut. With Richard Sterban doing his thing on it and the horns just making it first class…it had so much magic in it it’d just raise the hair on your arms.”

During his career Frazier earned three Grammy nominations for his work on “There Goes My Everything” “All I Have To Offer You (Is Me)” and “Elvira.”

In 1980 Frazier’s “Beneath Still Waters” became a No. 1 country hit for Emmylou Harris and Frazier also co-wrote Tanya Tucker‘s first No. 1 hit “What’s Your Mama’s Name?”

Frazier was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1976.

“Dallas Frazier is among the greatest country songwriters of all time” said Kyle Young CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. “He could convey infectious fun with ‘Elvira’ and then write something as stunningly sad and true as ‘Beneath Still Waters.’ His songs helped Connie Smith to become a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. He was a man of kindness generosity and faith who overcame a hardscrabble upbringing to offer smiling gifts to all of us. He lived a beautiful life of a beautiful mind.”

Outside her window the Chilkat a powerful glacier-fed river churns toward the sea. In Hotch’s backyard salmon strips are curing in a smokehouse. Hotch was born here in Klukwan Alaska a Tlingit settlement with a name that translates to “eternal village.”

The motifs Hotch weaves were passed down from the generations of women who came before her including a pattern called “the backbone of the salmon.” For the Tlingit people this symbol represents thousands of years of interconnection with the abundant salmon of the Chilkat watershed. In Tlingit the name Chilkat means “salmon storehouse.”

Her relationship to the river is what drives Hotch to be an outspoken opponent of the Palmer Project a proposed zinc copper silver and gold mine directly upstream from Klukwan. The deposit is being explored by a small mining corporation called Constantine Metal Resources. Hotch and others in the community worry that if the mine were to be developed waste materials from the ore extraction could lead to acid mine drainage—and with it the risk of heavy metals leaching into the watershed. Even small amounts of heavy metals can have catastrophic consequences for salmon.

If the Palmer Project becomes a mine it’s projected to operate for between 10 and 15 years. For Hotch risking the health of the local salmon runs for such a short-lived opportunity is misguided. “Where’s the sense in it?” she asks. “The end result is even more poverty because we’ve always been able to fall back on our salmon.”

Klukwan is not the only community dependent on healthy Chilkat salmon runs. About 35 miles south of the proposed mine is the town of Haines located where the river meets the Pacific Ocean. Haines and Klukwan are remote communities bordered by glaciated mountains temperamental ocean and a highway from Canada that is often impassable in the winter. Food security is therefore a critical issue for many locals. Groceries are shipped in on barges and prices are marked up to reflect the 1100-mile mile journey from Seattle. Luckily wild fish and game are readily accessible. The most recent survey by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game shows that more than 91 percent of households in the Chilkat Valley consume subsistence-harvested salmon.

Without the salmon runs it’s hard for Hotch to imagine people continuing to live in Klukwan. During her lifetime she’s seen a lot of resource-extraction ventures come and go “but our people don’t have another place to go. This is our home.”

“We can't just wait and see because we don’t need an actual mine to get to the point of having an environmental disaster. It’s the exploration process that could start the acid mine drainage.”

Constantine Metal Resources started exploring the Palmer deposit in 2007. Constantine is what’s known as a ”junior mining company”—that is an outfit that’s in the business of mineral exploration. Once a deposit has proven value the junior company sells the majority of shares to investors while retaining enough equity to see a payout. It’s a high-risk business model and most fail.

One of the challenges of bringing on investors is gaining social license to operate from nearby communities says Shannon Donahue a Haines-based organizer with the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. But so far Constantine has struggled to get that kind of broad support from area residents. The tribal government in Klukwan has consistently expressed concern about the Palmer Project's potential to pollute the watershed. Local and national environmental groups are also opposed. The Audubon Society for example has expressed concern that the mine could disrupt the world’s largest gathering of bald eagles the Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve.

But residents in Haines are conflicted on the topic. Constantine has made an effort to integrate itself in Haines; the company offers a scholarship to graduating high school students contributes money to more than a dozen local organizations and sponsors popular events like the Southeast State Fair. There are some people in Haines who believe that mining can be done safely and they’re willing to fight for the high-paying jobs that Constantine has promised even if those jobs only last for 15 years. Some residents view the debate around the mine as divisive and would rather avoid the conversation altogether.

According to Donahue there are people in the community who are waiting to see the final plan for the Palmer Project before they take a position “for or against” the mine. “It’s tempting to reserve judgment but we can't just wait and see because we don’t need an actual mine to get to the point of having an environmental disaster” she said. “It’s the exploration process that could start the acid mine drainage.”

The mineral deposit is located in a claustrophobically tight mountain valley within spitting distance of creeks that flow into the mainstem of the Chilkat. The Palmer Project’s operations are in the path of several avalanche chutes and the entire region experiences frequent seismic activity. “Given the likelihood of major snowfall rainfall avalanche and seismic events in the immediate area it would be hard to locate a mine in a more dangerous place for critical salmon habitat” says Gershon Cohen of Alaska Clean Water Advocacy.

For years Constantine’s exploration has had minimal impact. Now however the project is at an advanced stage of exploration and the next step in the process is excavating a massive underground tunnel. Donahue explains that this is when things get dangerous. “They’re going to hit water and they’re also going to hit rocks that contain potentially acid-generating rock and heavy metals” she says.

In an email response to questions a Constantine representative responded to concerns about environmental impacts. ""The proposed exploration ramp has been designed to avoid intersecting acid generating rock"" the company wrote. ""Holes have been drilled to determine rock and water quality along the route of the proposed ramp and there is good surface geology exposed above the ramp that indicates that the rocks are mainly carbonate rich basaltic rocks that are not acid generating.""

To excavate this waste Constantine needs a permit for which the company first applied in 2019. In an effort to avoid developing a substantial water treatment plan the company proposed injecting acid-contaminated water back underground. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation awarded Constantine the permit in July of that year.

Concerned residents and conservation groups quickly contested the state’s decision pointing out the inevitability of the contaminated groundwater mixing with surface waters that ultimately flow into the Chilkat. In an unusual move the department remanded the permit to another state agency the Division of Water. It felt like a small victory for Hotch Donahue and other mine opponents.

It’s not uncommon for junior mining companies like Constantine to go bankrupt and with its permit in limbo the company’s fortunes were plummeting in that direction. But in spring 2021 Dowa a Japanese smelting company bailed Constantine out by purchasing majority shares in the project. With the influx of cash Constantine has said that it plans to reapply for permits to dig its tunnel in 2022 and to complete exploration in 2023.

Dowa’s new status as majority shareholder has Donahue concerned. “Dowa refuses to engage with the community” she says. “We’re at a point now where Dowa gets to call the shots but we’re still dealing with Constantine. And Constantine isn’t necessarily the company that will wind up making the decisions.”

Meanwhile the tribal government of Klukwan has sent letters to Dowa executives to express opposition to the Palmer Project. Hotch knows that they’ve read the letters but she said that it feels like Dowa has “turned a deaf ear” to Klukwan. Hotch argues that mining in the Chilkat watershed could impact Dowa’s home country Japan which has been the largest importer of Alaska seafood for over 40 years. “They may think that they aren’t risking anything by doing this in our backyard rather than on their island” she said. ”But they depend on our salmon almost as much as we do.”

The Chilkat River salmon support commercial fisheries across Southeast Alaska and the Haines harbor is full of fishing boats owned by local families. “Salmon are an important food source not just for Klukwan and not just for the Chilkat Valley but for Southeast Alaska for the United States for the world” Hotch said. “We have an obligation a responsibility to take care of them.”

Santo Domingo DR

The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources opened an investigation to sanction the people seen in a video mistreating the manatee Juanita while she was on the banks of the Ozama River where she has been living for several months.

The institution indicated that following the provisions of Law 64-00 which govern the entity they would take action against the aggressors of the manatee.

The Minister of the Environment Orlando Jorge Mera reiterated that no abuse against natural resources and different species of animals would go unpunished under his administration while emphasizing the importance of taking care of these endangered marine mammals.

The ministry also reported that the manatee was rescued and is in the dam of the Santo Domingo Aqueduct and Sewerage Corporation (CAASD). Juanita has no injuries and has her tracker.

“The Ministry’s staff is working hard together with the Dominican Foundation for Marine Studies (Fundemar) to ensure that she Pepe Lupita and all the manatees that are in Dominican waters are kept in optimal conditions while they enjoy their life in the country’s waters” he explained.

The Marugame Headquarters of Imabari Shipbuilding Co. is seen in Marugame Kagawa Prefecture in July 2021.

The struggle for supremacy in the global shipbuilding industry has been thrown into turmoil with the European Commission rejecting the merger of South Korean giants Hyundai and Daewoo.

Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. is already the world’s largest shipbuilder by tonnage and merging with world No. 3 Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. would have created a leviathan of a company. Not only did this raise concerns about competition but Hyundai and Daewoo also have a combined market share of over 60% for LNG tankers which have high added value.

European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager an executive vice president of the EC referred to the construction of these tankers for liquefied natural gas when explaining the Thursday veto.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

“Given that no remedies were submitted the merger would have led to fewer suppliers and higher prices for large vessels transporting LNG” she said in a statement.

The huge LNG tanker market is valued at ¥5.2 trillion. These tankers are an important means of transportation in light of the energy security situation in Europe.

Staying afloat

The global shipbuilding industry was hit by the 2008 global financial crisis triggered by the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers which led to a sharp decline in orders and an industrial recession. As a result the industry is undergoing reorganization worldwide.

In China the two major state-owned shipbuilders merged in 2019 creating the world’s second-largest shipbuilder China State Shipbuilding Corp.

In Japan Imabari Shipbuilding Co. the country’s largest shipbuilder took a 30% stake in the nation’s No. 2 firm Japan Marine United Corp. last year creating a top-tier consortium. Mitsui E&S Holdings Co. and Tsuneishi Shipbuilding Co. also entered into a capital alliance last year.

On the back of Japan’s period of rapid growth in the 1960s the nation’s shipbuilding industry grew to account for about 50% of the global market in the 1980s. From the 1990s however Chinese and South Korean shipbuilders used lower prices to drive Japanese companies into a corner.

The current market share of Japanese shipbuilders has dropped to just over 20% which has forced the domestic industry to strengthen its competitiveness through reorganization. Further reorganization may be necessary in the future.

Chinese and South Korean shipbuilders have grown through generous government subsidies and financial support. Japan and the EU have filed complaints with the World Trade Organization against South Korea for violating international rules. There are also other clashes among shipbuilders around the world.

An official of a Japanese shipbuilder said the latest EU decision “was good for us since normal competition has been maintained.”

The official added that there is the possibility that the South Korean companies will find a way to realize the merger by shedding some of their businesses.

“Once such a merger is underway” the official said “it can’t be stopped.”

Wind in Japan’s sails

Global demand for shipping has been growing with shipbuilding demand also recovering after it temporarily plummeted due to the pandemic. Japan’s shipping companies’ order backlog has recovered to the pre-pandemic level of 2018.

In response to the decarbonization trend the development of next-generation ships is gaining momentum worldwide. These ships use ammonia or hydrogen as fuel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Shunichi Miyanaga chairman of the Shipbuilders’ Association of Japan has high hopes for this trend.

“Existing ships will exit the market if they cannot meet environmental standards” said Miyanaga who is also chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. “Shipbuilding will advance further through building replacement ships.”

Shipbuilders need to increase their business strength as they are under pressure to invest in environmental measures and review their production facilities. The latest EU decision may give the shipbuilding industry momentum to seek further restructuring.",,,

The pair combined for 40 points in Wednesday night's win and Moore made a series of clutch plays in the final two minutes.""That comes from repetition in practice"" said Moore. ""We practice those end of game situations all the time what to do and where our teammates are going to be at. When it comes to the game it's second nature.""Villanova is 9-0 this season when it outrebounds its opponent as it did Wednesday night at Xavier. It's been a committee approach for the Wildcats with guards like Moore – who grabbed nine against the Musketeers – playing a significant role on the glass.""That's one of our core principals – rebounding and being tough"" Moore stated. ""In the Big East you play against big teams that are physical like Butler. You've got to be tough and it's not just the bigs rebounding.

Vasiliy Chinikaylo 31 of Swoyersville was held in the Lackawanna County Prison on $100000 bail after his arrest Thursday on robbery and other charges.

City detectives accused Chinikaylo of robbing the Wells Fargo Bank branch office at 101 N. Main Ave. in West Scranton on Dec. 30 2019.

During the holdup a bearded man in a black coat and gray hat passed the teller a note written in orange marker on a white business envelope that read “I have a bomb!! Calmly give me all your money no ink or trackers or else!!”

After receiving an undisclosed amount of cash the man fled on foot.

Crime scene detectives later collected DNA from the envelope and submitted the samples to a state police laboratory for analysis detectives wrote in Chinikaylo’s arrest affidavit.

In August state police notified detectives the DNA from the envelope preliminarily matched known DNA samples belonging to Chinikaylo but the lab required a confirmatory sample from the suspect to make a final conclusion the affidavit said.

Investigators learned Chinikaylo was on probation in Luzerne County for a robbery that happened after the Wells Fargo holdup. After securing a search warrant detectives obtained a new DNA sample from him as he left a meeting with his probation officer Sept. 20 the affidavit said.

The state police lab confirmed Oct. 26 the new sample matched the DNA recovered from the bank robbery note detectives said.

Magisterial District Judge Laura Turlip arraigned Chinikaylo on four counts of robbery along with charges of recklessly endangering another person terroristic threats theft by unlawful taking and receiving stolen property."

It doesn’t matter if your gaming PC is incredibly powerful already booting Windows 11 in seconds and playing any modern game with ease. There’s always going to be something that’ll come out that’s better than what you’ve currently got which can make your PC that little bit faster.

While we’d all love to constantly upgrade our machines like an ever-evolving RGB-lit Frankenstein’s monster as we all know the real world sucks and there are certain realities that can kill this dream: money and hardware.

While upgrading your PC is certainly cheaper than buying or building an entirely new one it can still be an expensive endeavor especially when swapping out certain components. Your budget then can limit your upgrading ambitions.

Then there’s the hardware. After a while some of your essential components will become outdated and unable to support the latest technology which limits what you can upgrade. This means making upgrades to core components such as the motherboard and CPU that can be far more expensive and time consuming.

Aging mobo blues

This is the position I’ve found myself in. My main gaming rig remains an absolute beast and I have absolutely no issue with its performance. But… I am also a sucker for new hardware. I have several SSDs installed two speedy M.2 PCIe 3.0 drives one for Windows 11 and intensive apps and the other for game installs.

I also have a larger SATA III SSD for storing files lighter apps and generally anything that doesn’t need super-speedy file transfer speeds due to SATA III being a lot slower than PCIe 3.0.

This setup has worked pretty well for a while with Windows 11 loading in a few seconds and games generally starting up quickly as well.

However as is always the way with PC gaming there’s a few annoying quirks and also room for improvement.

For some reason both Steam and the Xbox Game Pass on PC no longer let me install games on the M.2 SSD. It’s a particularly frustrating state of affairs and I’ve tried a few things to fix it. It seems like the only option would be to format the drive but the problem there is that other apps such as Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store have no issue with it. Formatting it would mean having to redownload a lot of games.

Another issue is that at 1TB it’s starting to fill up. My options then are to install games on the slower drive (no thanks) or start filling up my boot drive with games (eew).

Or… I could install a new drive.

Obviously that’s the route I decided to take. However this is where the hardware limitations I spoke about earlier come into play.

I’d been eying up the speeds of the new breed of PCIe4 M.2 SSDs that promising incredibly high speeds of 7000MB/s. These drives are transforming the way many people play – and design – games. The PS5 has been built around having a speedy SSD of that quality and an increasing number of games are now being designed with those kinds of speeds in mind.

However my rig has the Intel Core i9-9900K a fine 9th generation processor but it is limited to PCIe 3.0. A quick benchmark of my current gaming M.2 drive gives me speeds of 3402MB/s read and 3319MB/s write. Sure that’s not bad and it’s much faster than any SATA III drive would be (they top out at around 600MB/s – see why I wouldn’t want to install a game on that?) but it could be faster.

Of course with my current hardware setup PCIe 4.0 drives are out of the question unless I upgrade both my CPU and motherboard. That’s not just an expensive upgrade but an absolute pain as well. At that point it’s almost worth just buying a new PC.

So was I out of luck? Actually no. Western Digital have a rather unique product that could help solve my issues…

The power of RAID

Enter the WD_Black AN1500 SSD add-in card. Looking a bit like a slim graphics card with no video outputs the AN1500 pops into an empty PCIe slot and promises speeds close to that of a PCIe 4.0 SSD.

How does it do this? Well within the metal chassis of the AN1500 are two WD SN730 NVMe SSDs set up in RAID 0 with an enterprise-grade controller. Unlike some types of RAID configurations where several drives are used together as backups RAID 0 is all about speed.

Essentially the AN1500 uses RAID 0 and two SSDs to split data into blocks (also known as ‘stripes’). These stripes can then be simultaneously written and read to the SSDs drastically speeding up the performance of the drive.

This is how the AN1500 offers much faster drive speeds but there are drawbacks primarily with price. The AN1500 comes with two SSDs but it's treated as a single drive in Windows.

That obviously adds to the price compared to a single large SSD and the AN1500 is definitely an expensive addition. However it’s still cheaper than replacing the CPU and motherboard of a PC.

The WD_Black AN1500 SSD has been out for a while now but I’ve been intrigued by it for a while. Using RAID 0 for performance isn’t new but the WD_Black AN1500 SSD is preconfigured for ease of use. As with other WD_Black devices it’s got a cool-looking metal chassis and it packs RGB as well. What’s not to love?

Installing it is also very easy. I love M.2 drives but they are often located in difficult places to reach on the motherboard – sometimes even on the rear side. This can make installing them tricky if the motherboard is already in the PC case.

PCIe slots are much easier to reach though due the GPU I have installed the Nvidia RTX 3090 being SO HUGE there was still a bit of fiddling about. The WD_Black AN1500 SSD has a PCIe 3.0 x8 interface so you need to make sure you don’t put it into a PCIe 3.0 x4 slot which some motherboards have. If you do the SSD will still work but performance is impacted.

With the slick design and RGB lighting it looks great installed alongside the GPU and when I powered up my PC I ran a quick benchmark to see how it performed. The results were impressive with read speeds of 6154MB/s - twice that of my other SSD and a write speed of 4441MB/s.

I also wanted to try out a game on it so I moved Far Cry 6 over. On the older SSD it took 1:03.97 (one minute three seconds) to load the game and get to the main screen (skipping the opening cinematic).

On the new drive it took just 58 seconds to load. Not a huge difference and loading into the actual save game took around the same time 10 seconds. But in a large open-world game the WD_Black AN1500’s faster speeds allowed for faster texture streaming which led to less pop-in of surfaces and textures when traversing the world.

It’s still early days with the drive but already I’m impressed. I’m looking forward to trying out more games on it and so far it feels like it’s given my PC a new lease of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,

EAU CLAIRE Wis. (AP) – After more than a decade of alternating boom-and-bust cycles the regional frac sand industry appears to be stabilizing — at least for now.

That's the assessment of UW-Eau Claire geology professor Kent Syverson who also serves as a consultant for the frac sand industry.

""It's adjusted now to a different base level. Now it's kind of in equilibrium I would say"" Syverson said.

While he doesn't expect the industry ever to go back to the way it was from 2011 to 2014 when new mines and processing plants were popping up like dandelions across west-central Wisconsin to take advantage of the region's silica sand reserves Syverson said the surviving facilities seem to have found reliable markets for their sand including some that shifted to producing for other industries such as glassmaking.

Wisconsin mines needed to find alternate destinations to ship their sand to replace the giant market that mostly evaporated when energy companies built a number of sand mines closer to oilfields in Texas the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram reported.

The production expansion pushed down prices and enabled oil drillers to get local sand for less than the cost of shipping it from Wisconsin forcing several fracking sand companies to pause or shut down Wisconsin operations in recent years. Syverson estimated that fewer than half of the frac sand facilities built in the region — mainly the lowest-cost producers — remain viable.

However the freefall has stopped and the market for the northern white sand produced in Wisconsin is strengthening once again said Brandon Savisky senior research analyst at IHS Markit.

Annual production capacity for northern white sand has increased from about 12 million tons in early 2020 to 21 million tons now a rise of roughly 75% Savisky said noting that Wisconsin remains the nation's No. 2 shipper of sand behind Texas.

""Demand for sand has definitely picked up all across America"" Savisky said ""and northern white sand was probably more stable than local sand throughout last year.""

While some Wisconsin sand is being shipped by rail to Texas once again in response to trucker shortages that are part of nationwide supply chain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic much of it is being delivered to oilfields in western Canada North Dakota and Appalachia that haven't developed local sand supplies he said.

""The landscape has gone from chaotic anxiety as we came out of 2020 to becoming more cautiously optimistic as mines began to restart and activity recovered"" Savisky said. ""Now pretty much all sand mines are working near capacity.""

Source Energy Services which owns and operates Wisconsin frac sand mining facilities in Weyerhaeuser Blair and Preston has been the leading supplier of fracking sand to the Western Canadian Sedementary Basin for close to a decade said SES spokeswoman Meghan Somers.

While the Calgary Canada-based company also supplies other basins in the U.S. the Canadian market will continue to be a focus she added.

Somers agreed that the switch to local sand combined with low commodity prices has made it especially difficult for Wisconsin sand industry participants.

The vast majority of the mines producing northern white sand are in Wisconsin with the bulk of them located within 80 miles of Eau Claire.

The sand is used in hydraulic fracturing — the drilling technique commonly known as fracking that involves injecting a mixture of sand water and chemicals deep into underground wells to force oil and natural gas to the surface. The sand is used to hold open fissures in the rock.

Northern white sand prized by fracking companies for its coarseness durability and the spherical shape of its grains is still considered to be of higher quality than the sand produced in Texas but producers have developed methods to make the lower quality sand work well enough to satisfy their needs.

Most importantly to producers the Texas sand is cheaper because it doesn't have to be shipped more than 1000 miles by rail from Wisconsin to the oil and gas deposits in the Permian Basin in west Texas and southeast New Mexico.

The possibility of more Texas trucking disruptions leading to a surge in orders for northern white sand in the Permian Basin is a wild card that Syverson said he's watching because it could spark another temporary boom in the demand for Wisconsin sand.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90ZG4vbmFtZS9kb25hbGQtdHJpbWJsZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjI1ODkxNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Donald Trimble Obituary (1934 - 2022) - Longview WA - The Daily News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/tdn/name/donald-trimble-obituary?id=32258915 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90ZG4vbmFtZS9kb25hbGQtdHJpbWJsZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjI1ODkxNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Williams 34 told WMN as a teenager she did not know what she wanted to do. But since her father worked in the oil industry she studied sciences in case she wanted to work with him later on.

“While doing CXC I had English teachers who let me know I had a way with words so I should pursue something along those lines. Still having no clear direction as to where to go I stumbled upon journalism and public relations with COSTAATT (College of Science Technology and Applied Arts Trinidad and Tobago).”

While studying for her associate degree at COSTAATT she had the opportunity to do an internship at a radio station and decided that was what she wanted to do with her life. However after completing her degree she went to work at a bank but continued looking for broadcasting opportunities.

Williams auditioned for a local online news site but was too nervous to do well. Fortunately someone at SynergyTV saw her audition tape and asked her to audition for the TV station.

“That audition never saw the light of day. They saw the bloopers for the audition with me making all sorts of faces and O’Brian (Haynes general manager of SynergyTV) said ‘Yip. I want her.’ And that’s how I got started in television.”

She started at Synergy in May 2015 as a producer and presenter and stayed for about two years. She was the only female presenter at the time and covered entertainment news both live and pre-recorded filled in as host on a number of shows and met a lot of people in the local entertainment industry.

“That was a baptism by fire but it gave me a lot of room to have creative input. I was very involved in the process of creating a product but there was a lot of trial and error.”

In November 2015 the unit with which she worked at the bank closed so she took it as a sign to go into broadcasting full-time but as a freelancer.

Over the years she has worked as a digital media content manager for a number of companies as well as voice talent and master of ceremonies for many others including Flow Sports TT bmobile and MasterCard.

Wanting to be part of something good and give back to communities she accepted the position of YMCA Ambassador and host for its activities and events between 2016 and 2017.

Williams is currently co-host of TTT’s the NOW morning show and Next 99.1 FM’s mid-morning show TeamUp in the Morning and does UNDP public service announcements.

She is also the facilitator for the Ministry of Sports and Community Development’s virtual outreach initiative TT Online Community Voices. She said she enjoys the conversations with experts and giving people information they would not easily access otherwise on numerous topics including finances and home ownership.

“It’s information the average man on the street needs but is not necessarily getting. And acting as a facilitator really benefits me because I get all the information.

“It also really lends itself to having more responsible and valuable conversations. It’s really important especially as media practitioners that we understand that we’re not just there to entertain and talk but to effectively inform. I think that’s a big gap that exists and I really want to be a part of fixing that.”

She is also the host of Tourism Trinidad Ltd's Let's Tour: Sweet Sweet Trinidad television series where she visits places around Trinidad. She explained that the show “got the go ahead” for a second season but filming paused because of the last lockdown.

“I really pride myself in being 100 per cent maybe too much sometimes. But what that did was give me the opportunity to have people live vicariously through me to have a very authentic experience.”

Williams has always been interested in people and believes that talking to and observing others is the best way to learn. And being an outgoing person who likes to dance sing laugh and who sometimes has no filter she thrives working in entertainment and on the field engaging with people. She loves that her job requires that she be herself.

“I never wanted to do hard news because there tends to be an expectation of females particularly in the media. They are expected to be proper and reserved or are not taken seriously. So it was very important to me to show that duality.

“There is no reason I can’t go to fetes and ask you about your outfit or experience or try tourism products in TT and enjoy myself and also hold an articulate conversation about things that are more meaningful and contribute to society’s development.

“I realise that I have a responsibility as anyone who is slightly recognisable in public to make valuable contributions to your time or ensure you come away better because of it.”

Williams’ hope is that she shares useful information leaves people feeling positive or energised and encourages people to live fully and enthusiastically.",,,,,,,,,

The S&P 500's 2022 struggles continued as bank stocks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season by reporting mixed numbers.

On Tuesday Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee as part of his reconfirmation process. Powell said persistently elevated inflation is a signal the U.S. economy ""no longer needs or wants"" highly accommodative monetary policy measures but added that the ""era of very low interest rates"" is likely here to stay.

Following Powell's testimony the U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday that the consumer price index increased by 7% in December the highest inflation recorded since 1982. The CPI reading was up 0.5% compared with November and in line with economist estimates.

On Monday video game developer Take-Two Interactive announced a $12.7 billion buyout of Zynga maker of popular social media game ""FarmVille."" The $9.86-per-share buyout price represented a 64% premium to Zynga's previous week's closing share price.

Casino stocks Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts rallied on Friday after the Macau government released a draft of a new bill outlining the license renewal process for Macau casino operators. Macau will maintain a maximum of six total licenses suggesting it's likely the current six Macau operators will all have their licenses renewed for 10 years.

JPMorgan withdrawal

Shares of U.S. megabank JPMorgan Chase dropped more than 5% on Friday morning after the company reported a fourth quarter earnings beat but cut its 2022 financial guidance and said ""inflationary pressures"" will increase expenses by 8% this year.

Investors will get more fourth-quarter earnings numbers in the week ahead including reports from Bank of America UnitedHealth and Procter & Gamble on Wednesday and Netflix on Thursday.

S&P 500 companies are on track to report full-year 2021 earnings growth of 45.3% according to FactSet.

Economic numbers

In the week ahead investors will get key economic updates from Asia on Monday when the National Bureau of Statistics of China releases its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate and on Friday when the People's Bank of China releases its latest interest rate decision.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Shares of Macau's top casino operators racked up as much as HK$65.53 billion ($8.42 billion) on Monday - or 15% of their market value - as the government of the world's largest gambling hub retained the limit on casino licences to six.

By the close of the Hong Kong market the six Macau casino operators had gained 9.9% in value or HK$42.2 billion putting the overall market value of the oprators at about HK$469 billion. Sands China led the rally.

Shares of Sands China Ltd which jumped as much as 22.3% ended the day up 14.6% in their biggest daily percentage gain since October 2011. That compared with a 0.7% decline in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.

Wynn Macau which jumped as much as 19.1% closed up 11.9% in its best day since March 2020.

Macau's government announced on Friday that the number of new casino operators allowed to function in the world's largest gambling hub would be limited to six with an operating period of up to 10 years.

The regulatory announcement provides new clarity and should remove most investors' key concerns such as dividends government oversight minimum shareholding by a Macau permanent resident and gaming tax Citi said in a research note.

The former Portuguese colony is the world's biggest gambling hub in terms of money wagered.

Macau massively tightened scrutiny of casinos in recent years with authorities clamping down on illicit capital flows from mainland China and targeting underground lending and illegal cash transfers.

The market value of U.S. casino operators including Sands China Wynn Macau MGM China and Melco gained as much as HK$43.23 billion ($5.55 billion in Hong Kong.

Citi raised target prices on the six Macau casino operators by 8%-14% following the government's clarification on the revisions in gaming law.

Shares of Galaxy Entertainment MGM China SJM and Melco finished up between 4.8% and 11.7%.

""The proposed bill would remove the current sub-concession structure but not change to the competitive dynamics ultimately"" Jefferies wrote in a research note.

""As the government crackdown on junkets continue we expect long-term pressure on VIP business"" Jefferies said adding that the near-term gross gaming revenue outlook remains bleak amid uncertainties over timing of border reopening with recent COVID-19 outbreaks in Mainland and Hong Kong.

The government outlined many of the key features of the upcoming bill in a press conference on Friday. There will be six concessionaires who will be given a 10-year license. Some of the more controversial proposals presented when the amendments were first published in September such as government supervision of the operators and restrictions on the distribution of capital appear to have been dropped.

MGM gratitude

MGM China

“The bill presented today provides details over various key aspects of the overall administrative procedures and timetable outlining a clear roadmap on the upcoming important milestone of retendering which is critical to maintain a healthy and sustainable development for the gaming industry in the future” MGM China said.

“At MGM China we wish to express our sincere gratitude to the Macao SAR Government for providing us guidance and ample timing in assisting us with our preparation towards the tender submission.”

Melco Resorts & Entertainment thanked the government for taking on board the opinions of society and the gaming industry when compiling the new law.

“Melco is fully confident in the development of the integrated tourism and leisure industry” it said. “The company is committed to participating in the public tender of the award of a gaming concession and will continue to promote economic diversification in Macau.”

SJM getting prepared

SJM Resorts

SJM Resorts also praised the government for listening to feedback.

“The bill has improved the relevant contents of the existing gaming law with details on the proposed amendments and clear guidelines for the benefit of a sustainable and healthy development of Macau’s gaming industry” it said. “SJM is getting prepared for the new tendering while awaiting the announcement of more details from the Government.

As always SJM fully supports and coordinates with the Government in safeguarding the security of the Nation and Macau SAR and in promoting the prosperity and stability of the city further advancing the cause of “One Country Two Systems” in Macau.”

Sands optimistic

Sands China put forward a similar message thanking for the government for setting out clear guidelines.

Sands China

“Sands China will fully cooperate with the SAR government to support the passage of the bill thereby contributing to the healthy and sustainable development of Macao’s gaming industry.

Sands China remains optimistic about the future of Macao’s integrated resort industry and is looking forward to submitting its bid for a Macao gaming concession” it said.

The actual bill is expected to be published in coming weeks and it will need to be passed to the Legislative Council for review. Following the passage work on the public re-tender can begin.

The current licenses expire on June 26th and the government has said it would be prepared to allow a short extension should the timeframe be too tight.

Wynn pioneer

Wynn Resorts

As one of Macau’s pioneering Concessionaires Wynn fully supports and welcomes the Macau SAR government’s draft amendment to the Gaming Law.

We are encouraged that the Government has expedited the review process and also taken into consideration the views of the industry and the general public and provided clarity on many of the outstanding issues.

We believe that the enhancement of these regulations will significantly strengthen the sustainable development of Macau over the long-term and we look forward to working closely with the Government and actively participating in the public tender process.

Galaxy for the community

Galaxy Entertainment Group

Galaxy Entertainment Group (GEG) welcomes the bill to amend the “Legal Framework for the Operations of Casino Games of Fortune” that the Macau SAR Government announced earlier. GEG will proactively support the related work of the Macau SAR Government as well as the gaming industry’s sustainable and healthy development in order to contribute to Macau’s long-term prosperity.

Dr. Lui Che Woo Chairman of GEG said “We agree and fully support the goals of the SAR Government’s proposed legislation which holds that national and Macau SAR security should be put as top priority when operating casinos and gaming-related activities whereas Macau’s economic diversification and sustainable development should be promoted.

We believe that having optimized laws and regulations in place will lay a solid foundation for the city’s steady development and propel the synergetic development of the gaming industry leading to Macau’s overall economic resilience and diversity.”

Deeply rooted in Macau GEG upholds the philosophy of “What is taken from the community is to be used for the good of the community” and is fully committed to making positive contributions to Macau.

Nevertheless Packer’s team was quick to indicate tentative support in a lunchtime statement which said it was “encouraged by today’s announcement”. A sale would end the Packer family’s 23-year association with Crown which kicked off with Kerry Packer announcing plans to acquire the original Melbourne casino in December 1998. James Packer’s determination to make a cathartic exit from the casino operator — which has dominated his professional and private life since Crown staff were arrested by Chinese authorities in 2016 — is no surprise. Just three years ago the billionaire scion himself was trying to negotiate a takeover of Crown first with Las Vegas giant Wynn and then an ill-fated sale to Lawrence Ho of Hong Kong’s Melco Resorts.

That was before a series of reports by The Age The Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes into Crown’s affairs in July 2019 triggered inquiries which led to Crown being deemed unsuitable to hold its casino licences in Sydney and Melbourne which sent the share price below $9 last year. Loading It has been a long slog getting the share price back above $13 which was Packer’s agreed selling price to Melco. But Crown’s new regime has acted quickly. Switkowski only formally joined Crown as chairman on December 1. He was brought in to steady the ship alongside a small crew of new directors after two years of rolling scandals and regulatory scrutiny triggered a total clean out of Crown’s board and senior management. Crown deemed Blackstone’s early December bid of $12.50 as too cheap but it was enough to offer Blackstone limited access to its books in the hope that would encourage it to go higher.

With Blackstone stalking Crown for the best part of a year one source close to the board said it had enough feedback from shareholders about what they would accept for their shares and had “war-gamed out” enough scenarios to be able to respond quickly. The board believes Crown shares (which closed at $11.63 on Wednesday) will certainly be worth more than $13.10 when it recovers from its regulatory woes and tourism bounces from the pandemic. “But not within a year” and not without risk the source said making Blackstone’s cash the best option for investors. Crown’s endorsement of the deal wasn’t strictly necessary either. But two other sources with knowledge of the events said that after knocking back Blackstone three times since March 2021 the suitor wanted a public vote of confidence from Crown if it put another $400 million on the table (which is a raise of $840 million from its opening offer). Blackstone’s takeover would need approval from NSW Victoria and WA’s gambling regulators and has a head start after applying for probity clearance almost a year ago. Its pitch to Crown is to have cash in investors’ hands by the end of June – before any rival can start its own regulatory approval process – and while The Star Entertainment Group Crown’s Sydney-based competitor and merger hopeful is mired in its own probity scandal.

James Packer at the WA Crown hearing in October last year. Credit: For those wondering what the future looks like for Packer if he gets his $3 billion-plus payday and finally cuts loose from the casino operator it probably is not that much different from his life right now. With the exit of his key lieutenants from the Crown board in February last year after the NSW casino regulator found it unfit to hold the Barangaroo licence Crown has effectively been just another investment in the CPH portfolio. “During the year the company continued to seek appropriate investments” said the private company’s most recent financial report lodged with ASIC. The accounts reported financial assets totalling more than $8.7 billion at a time when his Crown stake would have been worth well below $3 billion.

CPH has been focused back on Packer’s first love: Tech investing. “Tech has always been James’ interest” said one close associate. The One.Tel failure may loom large on his CV but the truth is Packer has been an astute investor on this front dating back to his investments in Seek and Carsales.com.au and Zillow (now held by Gretel Packer) in what was an astute bet on the migration of print classified ads to online platforms. He has also remained close to Seek co-founder Paul Bassat. CPH was an early investor in Bassat’s venture capital firm Square Peg Capital which has backed the incredibly successful graphic design startup Canva fintech Airwallex and Israeli freelance services marketplace Fiverr.

Credit: As for Packer personally untethering his fortunes from the business that has caused him so much anguish is not expected to change his personal life much either. “I feel that mentally he is in a much better space which is wonderful” said his mum Ros Packer during a tour of the Barangaroo work site in January 2020. “It shattered him with the employees in jail in China it shattered all of us.” And while the $72 million two-storey apartment he acquired last month atop Crown Barangaroo gives him a home in Australia insiders say he is unlikely to spend much time this side of the Pacific Ocean. With Packer’s former wife Erica and three children residing in Los Angeles the billionaire is expected to remain largely within his golden triangle of Los Angeles Aspen and the soon-to-be-completed mansion in Cabo San Lucas Mexico."

But when the goaltender does get back in action potentially next weekend during a back-to-back vs. Chicago Talbot won't just be facing an opportunity to suit up before the NHL All-Star Game after being chosen to represent the Central Division.

He'll also be on the brink of an important second half with the Wild a drive to decide the team's playoff fate that will either validate or discredit the team's earlier surge.

""You could see from the start of the season when we were a healthy team we were right up there with the top teams in the league"" Talbot said. ""I believe that's where this team belongs.""

Wild leading scorer Kirill Kaprizov and Talbot found out they would participate in the All-Star Game when rosters for the midseason showcase on Feb. 5 in Las Vegas were revealed on Thursday news that came amid a hiatus for Talbot.

Although he hasn't played since Jan. 1 at Target Field his 15 wins still rank near the top of the NHL leaderboard and most of the goalies ahead of Talbot have made more starts. This is the 34-year-old's first All-Star Game selection.

""You're always trying to push yourself to be better and finding new ways to improve every season"" he said.

This season he also has to rebound from that injury that pulled him out of the Winter Classic.

Talbot was hurt with about five or six minutes left in the second period an injury he said he didn't feel at first but one he ultimately couldn't play with. He was replaced for the third period by backup Kaapo Kahkonen with the Wild trailing the Blues 6-2 and the team went on to lose 6-4.

""I've never had this injury so it could've been the 12 days between games the minus-20 forecast"" said Talbot who's in the second season of a three-year $11 million contract. ""A perfect storm I guess. I honestly don't know if it would've happened either way. I can't really speak to that. Just a disappointing experience for it to happen when it did.""

Recently Talbot has been skating even joining the Wild on the ice and he's hoping to target a return in the coming days. Overall this season he's 15-8-1 with a 3.00 goals-against average and .909 save percentage.

""It's one of those things you don't want to rush back from"" Talbot said. ""You want to make sure when you come back you're back for good. I'm feeling good every day progressing every day.""

Without Talbot and a host of other regulars sidelined by injury or COVID-19 the Wild has admirably persevered to win three in a row after a 7-3 dispatch of the Ducks on Friday at Xcel Energy Center.

And more help should be on the way with the Wild activating defenseman Alex Goligoski from the COVID list on Saturday and reassigning defenseman Dakota Mermis to Iowa in the American Hockey League. Defenseman Calen Addison forward Matt Boldy and goalie Andrew Hammond also were shifted to the taxi squad. The Wild's next game is Monday afternoon at Colorado.

Until everyone is healed up — winger Nick Bjugstad defenseman Jonas Brodin and captain Jared Spurgeon are still injured and center Joel Eriksson Ek is out with COVID-19 — the Wild's potential is to be determined.

An eight-game win streak in November and December that overlapped with the team seizing the No. 1 seed in the NHL previewed what is possible when the team is mostly healthy. Whether the Wild is capable of an encore will start to become clear as Talbot and others rejoin the lineup.

""Right now we're just going through a stretch that every team goes through during a season"" Talbot said. ""You get a few injuries and obviously right now with COVID and stuff like that. The best teams in the league come out of it on the other side stronger and I believe this team can do that.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9ydW0uY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9wcm8vZm9yLXJlZC1ob3Qtd2lsZC1pY2UtY29sZC13aW50ZXItY2xhc3NpYy13YXMtYS10dXJuaW5nLXBvaW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For red-hot Wild ice-cold Winter Classic was a turning point,"ST. PAUL -- On the heels of arguably their worst loss of the season — the Wild fell 6-4 to the St. Louis Blues at the Winter Classic in a game that wasn’t even that close — veteran winger Mats Zuccarello held everyone accountable postgame.

Not only was he embarrassed by the performance put forth by the Wild with nearly 40000 fans struggling to stay warm in the stands at Target Field he was well aware the upcoming stretch had a chance to make or break this season.

Now a couple of weeks later Zuccarello is proud of the way the Wild responded in the face of adversity. Though they are still heavily depleted due to injuries the Wild have won three straight heading into a marquee matchup with the rival Colorado Avalanche on Monday afternoon in Denver.

Was the Winter Classic a turning point?

“Yeah” Zuccarello said. “Everyone was pissed off.”

Ask anyone on the Wild roster and they would agree with that succinct statement.

“I think after that I think that’s a good assessment” coach Dean Evason said. “It was a big stage. The guys knew that we didn’t do what we do to have success regardless of what the venue was or the weather was. We didn’t do what we do to have success. For the most part we’ve got back to it.”

As alternate captain Marcus Foligno put it that loss at the Winter Classic could’ve sent the Wild spiraling down the standings. Instead they bounced back with a gutsy win over the Boston Bruins a shootout win over the Washington Capitals and a blowout win over the Anaheim Ducks.

“Here we are now three wins later” Foligno said. “That’s just the character in this group. Yeah. It was a turning point.”

The fact the Wild managed to snag three wins in the past week and a half will go a long way in their playoff push. It helped them keep their head above water with guys like captain Jared Spurgeon top center Joel Eriksson Ek star defenseman Jonas Brodin and No. 1 goaltender Cam Talbot on the shelf.

“We lose those three games and we’re behind a lot more” Foligno said. “Maybe when we’re approaching the playoffs trying to get in we look back at these three games. That’s six points right there that might separate us from the next team.

“There’s always those little gaps in the season where we can look back and say ‘Well this made us or this broke us.’ We definitely want to be looking back at this come playoff time saying we did the right thing and we came together at the right time.”

As for the game against the Avalanche the Wild know that will serve as a good measuring stick. It’s been that way for the past few seasons.

“We have to be intense and ready to go” Foligno said. “They are probably the hottest team in the league right now. They just have that core that’s been with each other a while now and always seems to produce. No different. We just have to come up with more intensity and play them hard and make it feel like a playoff game. We want to go in there and take two points.”

That won’t be an easy task considering the Avalanche boast an 8-1-1 record in the past 10 games. They are firing on all cylinders with the top line of Nathan MacKinnon centering Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen.

“It’s about minimizing those waves of attack that they produce” Foligno said. “Just have to play those guys mean and be hard on sticks and block shots and things like that and make it hard on them generating speed through the neutral zone.”

If the Wild can do that they might have a chance. If not the Avalanche might run them out of the building.

“Just a quality hockey club with quality hockey players” Evason said. “They have a lot of different elements to their game. Obviously they have special people in their lineup that we all know and their system is real good. They compete their butts off. They do a lot of right things. It’s going to be a good challenge for us.”

The push to talk feature was introduced two years ago as a way for frontline workers to communicate easily on-field when the pandemic rate was at its peak. The app can now be accessed on both Android and iOS devices.

The Walkie Talkie app is a push-to-talk (PTT) communication feature that allows users to connect with their team through a respective channel. Outside parties cannot interact with the people inside the channel unless dragged in or given permission.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29mb21hbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMTE5MjctbWljcm9zb2Z0LXRlYW1zLXdhbGtpZS10YWxraWUtZmVhdHVyZS1iZWNvbWVzLXdpZGVseS1hdmFpbGFibGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Teams' Walkie Talkie feature becomes widely available,"Washington: Microsoft is making its Walkie Talkie feature available to all users of its Microsoft Teams.

According to The Verge Walkie Talkie lets Microsoft Teams users turn smartphones or tablets into a walkie-talkie that works over cellular data or Wi-FI. It was originally announced two years ago and has been available mostly in preview ever since.

The feature launched widely on Android in September of 2020 but now Microsoft says it's available for Zebra mobile devices as well as iPhones and iPads.

Microsoft has primarily pitched this at frontline workers employees who are customer-facing and run day-to-day operations inside companies. The software maker's collaboration with Zebra Technologies makes it work with a dedicated push-to-talk button for quick and secure communications.

As per The Verge these devices are used widely by frontline workers the employees that have helped steer the world through the ongoing pandemic.

Walkie-talkie features are still rare in communications apps. WhatsApp lets you record snippets of audio than can be sent and received and Slack launched its Discord-like Huddles feature last year to let people drop in and out of calls easily.

Apple did launch its own walkie-talkie feature on the Apple Watch in 2018 using push-to-talk over a FaceTime Audio call.",,,,,,
