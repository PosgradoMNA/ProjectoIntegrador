Werre has been selected as one of four recipients of “4 Under 40” a new program that recognizes up-and-coming leaders in the community.

Werre is the senior plant manager at 3M in Fairmont. He moved to the community with his family in June 2020

While he’s lived in several states during his adult life Werre actually grew up in Bemidji Minnesota and graduated from high school there.

“I went to college in Boseman at Montana State University” Werre said.

He got a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering and graduated in 2006. It was while he was in college that Werre was introduced to 3M.

“While I was in college I did a co-op experience with 3M so I had the chance to work at three different 3M facilities two of which were in the Twin Cities and one in Irvine California” Were said.

Upon graduating Werre joined 3M right out of college. He started working full-time at the St. Paul offices and stayed there about six years.

In 2009 Werre married Samantha who he had known since high school.

“Then we moved down to Decatur Alabama and lived there for about two years” Werre said.

That was over 2012- 2014. Then the couple move to California as Werre’s job with 3M led them there. He worked at two facilities in Irvine as a product manager. The family which includes Georgia 10 Jameson 7 and June 2 lived in California for five years.

“From there we moved back to Minnesota where it’s nice and cold” Werre said with a laugh.

But on a serious note he said that he and his wife who is also from Bemidji consider Minnesota home.

“An opportunity opened up for the plant manager and it was a growth opportunity for me. It was also an opportunity back to Minnesota where we wanted to be” Werre said.

As plant manager Werre has overall accountability of what happens at 3M. That includes overseeing the 100 employees at Fairmont’s site.

Werre has managed to get involved in several area organizations since coming to Fairmont. He’s a member of Fairmont Rotary Club and has done work with Habitat for Humanity and Hot Meals on Wheels.

He’s also involved with 3M Gives which donates money to a variety of organizations around the community like the Fairmont Opera House Heaven’s Table Food Shelf and area schools.

With Covid Werre said some things are different right now but 3M is a strong supporter of robotics programs in area schools. He said 3M has a program called “visiting wizards” that he would like to start back up.

“People with science backgrounds go to the elementary level students and share the excitements and joys of science technology engineering and math” Werre said.

Outside of the groups he’s involved with Werre is busy keeping up with his children’s schedules too. His oldest daughter was recently in an Opera House production and his son is a big sports fan.

He said the nice part about moving around is it gave him and his family the opportunity to experience different scales of communities.

“A smaller community like how we grew up in Bemidji fit our lifestyle and that’s what we wanted our kids to experience as well” Werre said.

Living several places Werre said he’s found you’ll always get something new from a new community. Down in Alabama he found southern hospitality and in California there was a slower-paced atmosphere.

“As much as I and my family can get from a community and experience we want to give back as well” Werre said.

He said that counts for donations and time in order to strengthen the community. Werre said giving to a community also helps one become connected to a community.

Werre admitted he was surprised to learn he had been selected as a recipient of 4 Under 40 with the main reason being his short time spent here.

“I also felt a sense of honor. Although I haven’t been a part of this community that long it was willing to recognize me not just myself but with 3M and what we can do for the community” Werre said.

He and the other three recipients Linsey Preuss Jen Kahler and Stephanie Busiahn will be recognized at 5:30 p.m. on Feb. 24 at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Fairmont. Tickets are on sale now at twinvalleybsa.org/4under40.

“In the short time span I’ve been in this community I’ve met tons of people deserving of this award and that’s what I like about this community– it’s a community. There’s a sense of togetherness doing what we can to make our area as good as possible” Werre said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC05Ny1ibGFjay1vZmYtbm9pci1kcTg1NzQtMDAxLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Max 97 Off Noir DQ8574-001 Release Date - SBD,"2022 marks the 25th Anniversary of the Air Max 97 which Nike introduces a new “Off Noir” colorway for the occasion.

3 They're moving in to this £3m property

The couple - who met on the set of Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2016 – are planning a £250000 rennovation to include a gym cinema and man cave.

American actress Zendaya 25 already owns a £3m home in Los Angeles but is said to be setting up roots with her boyfriend Tom in London.

It's close to his parents and childhood home in Kingston upon Thames.

A source told the Mirror: “They are over the moon about the property and getting their first home together.

“They are very much in love and wanted their first home to be in London where Tom grew up. Everyone is thrilled for them.”

Fans had long been hoping for the actors to get together ever since they began playing onscreen love interests in the web-slinging Marvel franchise.

Tom and Zendaya first started dating while filming the first movie though the duo never confirmed the relationship.

Two years after their 'split' they were pictured kissing in July 2021.

They have since caught the eye of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle who asked for secret talks with the couple - despite them never meeting previously a source has claimed.

The Duke and Duchess were eager to rub shoulders with the Spider-Man: No Way Home stars whose recent release took £1.27billion at the box office.

An old friend of Harry has revealed that the couple contacted Tom and Zendaya out of the blue and asked them to meet.

He told Mail Online: “Tom and Zendaya were rather bemused from what I hear.

“Tom had never met Harry or spoken to him in his life so didn't know what they wanted.”

However the two couples did meet up in secret at the Sussex's sprawling nine-bedroom Montecito home.

The source claimed: “The meeting took place.”

It's thought that the royals may have been eager to chat to American Zendaya and Brit Tom to persuade them to take part in one of their media projects.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vbm9yZG90LmFwcC84NjA1NjcxNzE1MjY0NTkzOTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Holland buys £3m London pad for him and Zendaya ｜ BANG Showbiz English,"Tom Holland has reportedly purchased a £3 million London pad for him and his girlfriend Zendaya.

The 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' star and his co-star - who already owns a luxurious Los Angeles mansion - are said to be keen to splash the cash on renovating the house with plans for a cinema gym and even a man cave.

The six-bed home is near to the 25-year-old actor's hometown of Kingston upon Thames where his parents still live.

A source told The Sunday Mirror: “They are over the moon about the property and getting their first home together.

“They are very much in love and wanted their first home to be in London where Tom grew up. Everyone is thrilled for them.”

The pair's romance became public last year and the actor recently admitted he struggles to deal with the lack of privacy.

He said: ""I’ve always been really adamant to keep my private life private because I share so much of my life with the world anyway.""

Tom also feels uncomfortable talking about their romance without the 'Euphoria' star being by his side.

He explained: ""It’s not a conversation that I can have without her. You know I respect her too much to say … This isn’t my story. It’s our story. And we’ll talk about what it is when we’re ready to talk about it together.""

Similarly Zendaya also 25 wishes that she and Tom were able to keep their relationship more private.

The Hollywood star also described their romance as ""sacred"" and ""special"".

She said: ""The equal sentiment [we both share] is just that when you really love and care about somebody some moments or things you wish were your own … I think loving someone is a sacred thing and a special thing and something that you want to deal with and go through and experience and enjoy amongst the two people that love each other.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9zcG9ydC8xNzQ3MzA0Ny9uYWRhbC1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW9wZW4teWFjaHQtamV0LWhvbWUv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL3Nwb3J0LzE3NDczMDQ3L25hZGFsLWF1c3RyYWxpYW4tb3Blbi15YWNodC1qZXQtaG9tZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rafa Nadal lives in a £3m Majorca mansion flies to tournaments in a £5m private jet and owns a £4.5m su...,"RAFAEL NADAL has created his own slice of tennis history.

But off the court Nadal lives a life of luxury generated by the wads of money he has earned from being an ace on it.

Rafael has made a whopping £150million during his illustrious career with more to come after his epic win Down Under.

He lives in a stunning beachfront Majorcan mansion which he paid around £3million for in 2013.

The Real Madrid super fan splashed the cash on a private jet - a Cessna Citation CJ2+ that flies him to tournaments around the globe that cost £5million.

Nadal can also travel by sea in his stunning £4.5million 80 Sunreef Power catamaran a super yacht he had custom-made.

He has had insurance worker Maria Francisca Perello by his side throughout his success with the pair finally marrying in 2019 after 14 years together.

A home with a view

Although Nadal likes to remain private like many professional athletes he gave us a glimpse into his amazing home in the Balearic Islands during lockdown in 2020.

Found in Porto Cristo Manacor he paid £3million for the stunning beach property that spans just over 1000 square metres.

It was reported that Nadal spent seven years renovating the mansion and pulled down some of the buildings before it became a dream place to live.

The design from what we've seen on Instagram is minimalist with all the essentials Nadal needs.

He has a fully-equipped gym to keep on top of his fitness.

While in his downtime he can enjoy views of the Mediterranean sea and idyllic coves from his window.

Time to fly

It's amazing to think that in 2010 Nadal tried to get on an economy flight to the Match for Africa until rival Roger Federer gave him a lift in his private jet.

Not wanting to get stuck again the 13-time French Open winner decided to buy his own plane - a Cessna Citation CJ2+ worth £5million.

Only 223 of the jets were made and it costs around £220000-per-year to maintain.

The Cessna Citation CJ2+ can accommodate eight passengers in luxury.

Not forgetting what Federer did for him Nadal gave Viktor Troicki a lift to London in his jet after beating him in the Mercedes Cup final the day before.

Troicki later thanked Nadal for allowing him to fly with him and shared a snap with the former World No1 and a pilot on Twitter.

""Thanks to great champion @RafaelNadal for giving us lift to London!"" he said.

By land and by sea

Back in 2019 Nadal traded in what yacht for another. He sold his 76-foot Italian-built MCY 76 motor yacht he called Beethoven for a cool £2million.

Then he put that money towards buying an amazing customised 80 Sunreef Power catamaran for £4.5million.

Built for long cruises and not skimping on full comfort the 80 Sunreef Power is powered by two 1200 hp engines.

It has a personal jet-ski garage and a 39-foot beam with a superyacht-style flybridge that offers a vast living space big enough to house a hot tub a wet bar and the waterfall-fed pool.

The main deck can be set up in a variety of ways dependent on your dining needs with different seating an open plan kitchen and a bar.

The master suite which is also on the main deck offers sea views as well as natural light thanks to the skylight overhead.

It has an en-suite bathroom with a shower a spacious closet and a desk.

There are four guest cabins and two crew cabins with up to 12 guests able to be accommodated at one time.

Sharing his life

Despite spending most of his time travelling around the world the one constant in his life is Maria 33.

Better known as Xisca Perello she has never been one to hog the limelight or a celebrity lifestyle though Nadal himself enjoyed hanging out with Spain's World Cup stars in 2010 with the trophy.

""It's not a world I want to be part of nor do I think Rafa would have chosen to be with a woman who looked for that in life"" she once said.

They met in the early 2000s and were firm friends before they started dating in 2005.

They married in 2019 in a star-studded ceremony in front of around 350 guests at the La Fortaleza castle in Majorca.

Celebrities in tow to watch the couple's nuptials included actors Tom Hiddleston Olivia Colman and Hugh Laurie.

But you'll never see her on the circuit cheering Rafael on.

""He needs his space when he is competing and just the idea of me hanging around and waiting on his needs all day tires me out"" she told the Telegraph in 2011.

""It would asphyxiate me. And then he would have to be worrying about me... No. If I followed him everywhere I think there's a risk we might stop getting along.""

They did however manage to squeeze in a trip to Salford's celebrity haunt Menagerie on Saturday evening.

But back to the show itself those getting to sit in the audience are able to choose a winner for each show.

2021 series winners Rose and Giovanni were on a winning streak until the tour visited Newcastle.

The city's very own Sara Davies and her partner Aljaž Škorjanec managed to pull off a win to her home crowd before Rose and Giovanni returned to the top spot.

But Strictly's Manchester fans had other ideas.

Anchorage. D.W. Hunt August 1954.

Part of a continuing weekly series on local history by local historian David Reamer. Have a question about Anchorage history or an idea for a future article? Go to the form at the bottom of this story.

Over the last two years I have answered more than 2000 history questions from readers. The following are some of the most interesting.

When was the first organized bicycle race in Alaska history?

The first organized bicycle race for which I have been able to find evidence was part of the 1898 Fourth of July festivities in Skagway. The race was open to any contestants and ran the “length of (the) wharf” likely meaning the town’s Juneau Wharf that extended over the water. The first-place prize was a box of cigars a bit of old-school Alaska that the Arctic Bicycle Club has not yet attempted to replicate. Four days later at that same wharf notorious gangster and conman Jefferson “Soapy” Smith was killed in a shootout.

Why is an area of Anchorage near Abbott Road called Abbott Loop when Abbott Road does not loop?

Road names and even their paths can change dramatically over time. Abbott Road was originally a loop onto what is now Lake Otis Parkway then called Otis Lake Road or Hillstrand Boulevard. As seen on a 1954 Anchorage map Abbott Road then included parts of what is now East 68th Avenue Elmore Road and Abbott Road. That loop contained a neighborhood that became known as Abbott Loop a name that lingered decades after the road names changed.

A similar local example is Sand Lake Road which used to form a large U-shaped course around Sand Lake that included what is now Raspberry Road Sand Lake Road and Dimond Boulevard. Due to poor city planning and multiple civic authorities road names in the Anchorage Bowl used to be sloppier. Some roads had multiple names depending on who or which agency you asked. And some street names were confusingly repeated. As in there was once a Susitna Street Susitna Boulevard and Susitna View Parkway. Similarly there have been multiple roads simultaneously named Alder Darby Glenn Maple and Northwood among other examples.

[Histories of Anchorage: Why isn’t there a J Street? And other reader questions]

A snow-covered monument at the Delaney Park Strip honors surveyor E.G. Fenn on Thursday Jan. 27 2022. (Bill Roth / ADN)

Why is there a monument to E. G. Fenn on the Park Strip?

E.G. Fenn — real name Elmo though few seemed to call him that — was a city surveyor pioneer in Alaska surveying and fierce advocate for winter sports education in schools. Per a 1977 Anchorage Times article “Fenn was an early leader of the surveying profession in Alaska. He was instrumental in the establishment of subdivision regulations in Anchorage and worked on projects such as updating monumentation and the definition of boundaries within the city.” Before Fenn surveying rigor in Anchorage was inconsistent often to the point of outright sloppiness.

He died in a 1967 helicopter accident on a surveying assignment outside Juneau. The monument at West 10th Avenue and I Street was erected in 1977. It cost $3000 roughly $14000 today after accounting for inflation and was paid for by the Alaska Society of Professional Land Surveyors. In addition it was built as a calibration baseline that surveyors could use to line up their equipment.

Is it true that Cowanesque Rock at the Kennedy Entrance to the Cook Inlet south of the Kenai Peninsula is named for a tanker that hit it? What happened?

On Oct. 17 1960 early in the morning the USNS Cowanesque a T-2 tanker on its way to Anchorage with 130000 barrels worth of jet fuel and avgas hit a then-uncharted rock south of the Kenai Peninsula tip. Eight of the nine tanks on the port side were ripped open. The ship was never in danger of sinking nor is there any mention of crew injuries. The captain reported a four-degree list but the ship wasn’t taking on water and was no longer leaking fuel by the end of the day.

The Cowanesque’s captain initially prepared to meet the USNS Suanmico at Bluff Point north of Kachemak Bay and transfer the remaining cargo. That plan was quickly dismissed given the environmental danger to Homer and Seldovia. Instead the Cowanesque went west and anchored off Chinitna Bay. Then it met the Suanmico off Kalgin Island transferred the remaining fuel and was later towed to Seattle for repair. The Suanmico proceeded to Anchorage for the delivery.

That was the Paradise Haven Lodge that was open by 1971 at the latest. John Barclay (1930-1991) was the proprietor. He was a large — 6′ 3″ and 300 pounds — and boisterous Texan who moved to Eagle River in 1955 to homestead.

His vision was for the lodge to become the “gateway to the Chugach State Park.” Understandably he also wanted to make money which led him into conflict with conservationists. In 1971 he applied for a liquor license but was opposed by the Sierra Club Anchorage Nordic Ski Club and some of his neighbors who were concerned that such a development would negatively affect both the neighborhood and park.

After an initial rejection Barclay won his license on appeal. However in fairness to the critics the lodge’s opening caused immediate parking issues. In addition there were noise complaints throughout the 1970s as the sounds of revving engines became the norm. Barclay regularly sponsored races of nearly every form including motorcycles cars ATVs and snowmachines.

Restaurants are difficult operations in the best of times and at better locations than the Paradise Haven Lodge. By 1980 he was struggling with unpaid debts. In April 1980 he sold the property to the state. Various sources have the building and five acres selling for between $248700 to $260000 roughly $850000 to $900000 after accounting for inflation.

After the sale state employees described the building as a poorly maintained wreck. The Eagle River Visitors Center opened on March 29 1981. In 1996 the state turned over the operation of the center to a private group and the site was renamed the Eagle River Nature Center.

In the 1990s there was a new Mercedes dealership just west of Peggy’s Restaurant on Fifth Avenue. The dealership was only there for a year or so before the buildings were carefully taken down. Why did the dealership move and why has the land remained empty since then?

In the spring of 1991 Harold Nye’s Import Center which was indeed a Mercedes dealer opened a new location at 1525 East Fifth Avenue next to Peggy’s Restaurant and across the street from Merrill Field. Just over a year later the city bought the land for about $1.8 million around $3.5 million after inflation. In September 1992 the Import Center relocated its stock to its older location at 821 East Fifth Avenue.

That 1525 East Fifth Avenue property is directly north of the north-south runway at Merrill Field. For years pilots Merrill Field management and the Federal Aviation Administration or FAA complained that the runway required additional space as crash room a safety measure for overshoots. That is why the property remains empty to this day. The city had unsuccessfully tried to purchase the land before the Import Center. According to contemporary sources the FAA and Alaska Department of Transportation would repay the cost to the city.

Critics at the time claimed the city had overpaid for the property which had been previously valued for less than $1 million. However the city contracted three independent appraisals that each appraised the property at around the purchase price.

Greg Abbott Is Pushing Republicans Across the Country to the Extreme Right,"Everything is bigger in Texas including a radicalized weaponized and emboldened GOP’s audacious abuse of power to fuel their culture wars and subvert democracy.

If you want to see a sneak preview of the GOP’s national project to maintain white minority rule then look no further than Texas the second-most populous state in the nation that now serves as a trendsetter for Republican state legislatures across the nation.

Texas Republicans led by Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz are committed to one-upping their colleagues by introducing the most extreme versions of voter suppression open carry laws anti-abortion bills and critical race theory (CRT) bans. Although the state serves as a massive warning for Democrats and the majority of Americans of what will happen when Republicans dominate the state legislature it also reveals insights into how activists and organizers can creatively resist and advocate for popular progressive policies.

The Lone Star State has become the “laboratory” for GOP politicians and their hard-right agenda according to Democrat Ben Chou who is running to be Commissioner of Harris County Precinct 4. “This is all for a national platform for when they go into the Republican primary” Chou said predicting Abbott and Cruz are nursing 2024 presidential ambitions and trying to “one-up” their conservative competition which includes Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida.

Like a reality-TV competition from hell Texas Republicans are showing off their skills.

They’re first flexing with voter suppression. “More than 440 bills with provisions that restrict voting access have been introduced in 49 states in the 2021 legislative sessions” according to the Brennan Center of Justice which tracks the GOP’s voter suppression efforts across the nation. Texas is leading the way.

Under the guise of fighting voter fraud which is almost nonexistent Texas Republicans passed Senate Bill 1 which restricts the state’s voting process narrows local control of elections and implements absurd voting ID requirements that negatively impact Democrats and voters of color. As an example in diverse and multi-racial Harris County nearly 16% of the 1276 absentee ballot applications received for the upcoming primary elections were rejected for failing to meet the new ID requirements. For perspective in the 2018 Texas primary only 2.5 percent of 4800 applications were rejected according to election officials. Fewer people can vote which means the bill is working exactly as planned.

The Texas GOP is becoming more extreme because they are responding to their radicalized base says Azra Siddiqui president of Wise Up Texas a non-partisan non-profit that empowers and educates Texans of South Asian descent to partake in civic engagement.

Take Sen. Cruz’s masochistic groveling before Tucker Carlson’s audience on Fox News where he backtracked from a previous statement where he correctly referred to the January 6th violent insurrection as a “terrorist attack.” A few days later Sen. Cruz was born again hard and he shamelessly peddled Carlson’s “false flag” conspiracy theory at a Senate hearing questioning DOJ officials.

As for Gov. Abbott Siddiqui believes he was pushed further to the right after being primaried by hard-right candidates such as former Rep. Allen West whose “far-right primary voters actually show up to the polls for the primary.” As a result Abbott criticized vaccine and mask mandates and banned any Texas entity including private employers from requiring the vaccine.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton followed up by launching lawsuits against President Biden’s federal vaccine orders for the National Guard. In turn these anti-mask and anti-vaccine regulations have harmed progressive activism according to Texas Democrat Jen Ramos State Democratic Executive Committee (SDEC) committeewoman for Senate District 21. Before the pandemic she said “it wasn’t easy for the GOP to push through their bills without pushback.” In previous years progressive groups and allies were always protesting at the Texas Capitol against GOP bills. More recently she said progressives were being outnumbered in testimony ten to one because many didn’t feel safe or comfortable going to the Capitol where even the Texas state troopers didn’t wear masks in the building.

Texas serves as a warning for Democrats across the nation to pay particular attention to state legislature races. Currently both houses in Texas have a Republican majority. As a result the GOP controls redistricting.

“Gerrymandering exists and we’re screwed when it comes to the state legislature. We’re not going to win a majority there any time soon” Chou said. “The GOP essentially has never advocated for a fair and representative democracy” Ramos told me. However with Republicans’ consolidation of power Ramos says their new position is basically “We don't have repercussions anymore so we're just going to run for it.”

That includes passing a dangerous and reckless open-carry bill that could weaponize the most unhinged among us. Before 2020 Siddiqui couldn’t imagine that moderate Republicans would pass the open-carry bill which allows Texans to carry handguns in public without permits or undergoing training. That it was signed into law by Gov. Abbott “was very shocking for a lot of us.” It’s proof that what were once the radicalized fringes of the GOP are now its center.

“This past legislative session was the most far-right that I’ve ever seen” Siddiqui said citing the introduction of the Texas abortion law SB8 which allows private citizens to sue anyone who facilitates an abortion after six weeks without any exceptions for rape or incest. Anyone who succeeds in their claim can be awarded $10000 by a court. The law has halted most abortions in Texas and serves as a template for Republicans across the nation especially after the conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear objections to the law—effectively leaving it in place.

Furthermore the Texas bill was a model used by Gov. DeSantis in Florida for his recent Stop WOKE Act which allows parents the right to sue teachers if they believe their kids are being taught critical race theory and to collect attorneys if they succeed in their lawsuit. Not to be outdone Gov. Abbott just trumped him with a new “Parental Bill of Rights” which gives Texas parents more control of their children’s education including decisions about the course curriculum especially concerning topics about race and LGBTQ+ issues. The bill will allow parents to stop educators from providing books depicting same-sex relationships which are described as “pornographic materials.”

The pivot for Democrats in Texas isn’t to necessarily chase moderates or abandon their progressive policies. Ramos cites the example of “rising star” Lena Hidalgo a 30-year-old country judge in Harris County the third-most populous county in the United States who according to Ramos won “against all odds” against incumbent Ed Emmett a well-liked Republican and one of the largest executives in Houston. Hidalgo is the first woman and Latina to be elected to the office. Ramos says Hidalgo is an example of a young woman who is progressive unapologetic about her Latinx heritage young—and all those factors were assets that helped her win mainly because she focused on issues that people cared about. As a result she’s been able to fight back against the GOP and advocate for COVID safety protocols which Ramos credits with saving lives.

Chou recommends Democrats focus on counties and cities where they can push back against the Republican-dominated state legislature which only meets for five months every two years and thus can’t spend their entire time restricting their efforts. “Up until that next legislative session we in counties we plot we strategize and we start enacting policies” he said. Democrats in Harris County for example put a polling location in the county jail because nearly two-thirds of the people are there because they are poor and can’t afford bail but can still legally vote. They did this without publicity.

In the end Democrats have to give people a reason to come out and vote for them and that means focusing on issues that concern them. They can’t simply rely on people of color—especially Latinos—to show up just because a significant and disturbing number of Republicans are aggressively xenophobic and hateful. In fact some troubling data shows that the GOP has been able to win over Latino voters recently focusing on issues concerning the economy immigration and the culture wars.

Ramos says it’s a good lesson to remember that Latinos are not a monolith and Texas Latinos “feel disenfranchised regardless of representation” with politicians often ignoring community concerns about health care transportation and safe drinking water. She said Latino voters will show up for “whoever actually advocates for issues that affect our communities—job security livable wage and food on the table.”

A great hope and test for Democrats is the upcoming governor’s race featuring former Rep. Beto O’Rourke. Both Ramos and Chou believe O’Rourke has a shot having mobilized grassroots communities specifically leaning heavily into health care and rural broadband and avoiding right-wing bait on divisive culture war issues.

Although it seems hopeless for Democrats in Texas Ramos urged people not to ignore Texas as unwinnable or dismiss it as a radically conservative state. Texas is far from a left-leaning state she said but Democrats are still mobilized especially in large metropolitan areas where there is still hope for systemic change.

However hope is no longer enough for Democrats. If they really want to mobilize the majority and push back against a radicalized GOP they have to step up organize fight back strategize and finally deliver for increasingly disillusioned voters who are tired of false promises and empty slogans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjIvMDEvMjkvYWJib3R0LXJ1bm5pbmctY29tZm9ydGFibHktYWhlYWQtb2Ytb3JvdXJrZS1pbi1kbW4tdXQtdHlsZXItcG9sbC1wYXh0b24tY291bGQtZmFjZS1ydW5vZmYv0gGdAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wMS8yOS9hYmJvdHQtcnVubmluZy1jb21mb3J0YWJseS1haGVhZC1vZi1vcm91cmtlLWluLWRtbi11dC10eWxlci1wb2xsLXBheHRvbi1jb3VsZC1mYWNlLXJ1bm9mZi8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott leads O’Rourke by 11 points in Texas governor race poll,"AUSTIN — Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is running 11 percentage points ahead of Democrat Beto O’Rourke in this year’s race for Texas governor according to a Dallas Morning News-University of Texas at Tyler poll released Sunday.

Buoyed by 2-to-1 support among whites and a growing number of voters who identify as Republican Abbott leads O’Rourke in a hypothetical matchup 47%-36%. He even holds a narrow lead over O’Rourke among Hispanics 40%-39%.

Registered voters are not in a great mood about Texas’ current direction: 50% say things are on the wrong track compared with 49% who say the state is headed in the right direction.

Still Abbott dodges much of the blame. His job rating has held at a respectable net approval 50%-45%. While he’s still underwater with independent voters with only 37% of them approving of how he’s performing he draws unfavorable views from just 38% of all voters.

President Joe Biden is viewed unfavorably by 57% of Texans. That may be one factor weighing down O’Rourke who in November was only six percentage points behind the incumbent. Abbott also has been linking the former El Paso congressman and presidential candidate to Biden saying in ads that O’Rourke is too liberal and untrustworthy to lead Texas.

The poll conducted Jan. 18-25 surveyed 1082 adults who are registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

Abbott increased his lead over O’Rourke which in November stood at just 45%-39% with modest “single-digit shifts” among various constituencies said UT-Tyler political scientist Mark Owens the poll’s director.

“It’s not the absence of McConaughey” he said referring to Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey who flirted for more than a year with the idea of running for governor but ultimately decided against doing so. In a head-to-head showdown between Abbott and O’Rourke voters of each major party still favor their party’s frontrunner by roughly 8-to-1 margins Owens said.

O’Rourke has accused Abbott of endangering Texans when he overrode local officials’ public health orders during the COVID-19 pandemic and failing to bolster the electricity grid by ensuring that natural gas companies as well as power generators weatherize facilities. However while the well-funded Abbott has been running TV and radio ads touting his achievements O’Rourke is still raising the funds needed for a sustained statewide ad blitz.

Owens cited another factor helping Abbott.

“Without the Legislature in session Governor Abbott is back to his position as the focal point of Texas politics and calls from Republicans to have a fourth special session have largely subsided” he said.

One further finding by the poll buttresses Republican optimism going into the 2022 midterm elections: By 54%-44% voters favor a generic GOP candidate for the Texas House over a Democrat. Two years ago by 51%-49% all voters favored a generic Democratic candidate for state representative including 59% of independents. Now independents break for the Republican Texas House candidate 54%-39%.

In a second hot statewide race Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s support among fellow Republicans is well below what he needs to avoid a runoff primary. Just 33% of likely primary voters say they’d endorse Paxton for a third term meaning he’d have to snare at least half of the 33% who are undecided to win renomination outright after the initial primary election on March 1. George P. Bush is running second with 19% and U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert third with 8%.

Abortion grid border

On issues as the likelihood increases that the U.S. Supreme Court may overturn Roe vs. Wade this year Texas voters say by 53% to 45% that the court should not topple its landmark decision in 1973 that granted women the right to an abortion during the first trimester of a pregnancy.

Among women voters the sentiment was more pronounced: 58% said justices should not overturn Roe vs. Wade.

A plurality of all voters wanting abortion rights voided favor banning the procedure after six weeks of a pregnancy as Texas currently is doing versus after 15 weeks as a Mississippi law being appealed to the Supreme Court prescribes. Of voters who want the court to reverse itself on abortion 39% prefer a six-week ban; 23% favor outlawing abortions after 15 weeks; and 36% say they’re not sure.

Josh Johnson 36 of Irving said he favors overturning Roe and supports Texas’ six-week ban. Lawmakers probably though should amend the Texas law to allow abortions in cases of incest and rape he said.

“Those are pretty rare” said Johnson a father of two and a graduate student at the University of Dallas. “Having more restrictions on abortion is something I would support. I was adopted as a child. It’s an issue … that I take seriously.”

Still “I do get a little bit frustrated with Republicans” Johnson said. “I would love to see more [government] programs that help support individuals who want to keep a child and make it more affordable and accessible for that person to make that decision.”

On other hot topics while 46% of all registered voters say they’re confident the state’s electricity grid is prepared to avoid blackouts this winter 47% say they aren’t. And by a plurality of 42%-37% they believe state officials are most responsible for a successful grid compared with energy companies.

Enforcing regulations to stop the spread of coronavirus and strengthening the grid should be higher public policy priorities for Texas than securing the Texas-Mexico border according to narrow majorities of all voters.

Reducing COVID-19 infections ranks higher than border security 52%-42%. And bolstering the energy grid ranks higher than border security 50%-41% the poll found. While large majorities of Republicans disagreed more than three-quarters of Democrats but also majorities of independents gave border security a lesser ranking as a priority than the pandemic and avoiding a repetition of last February’s deadly storm and utility outages.

On COVID-19 42% would be more likely to support reelection of school board members who temporarily halted in-person learning during spikes of infections. 33% would either be less likely to back such trustees or absolutely wouldn’t support them.

On wearing of masks at public schools 25% of voters favor no mandates 28% would allow school districts to decide and 41% say masks should be required in all K-12 classrooms.

For the general population on the coronavirus 57% of voters support local governments’ requirements that masks be worn in most public places and 35% oppose. Support for vaccine requirements or weekly tests for employees who won’t get the jab though wasn’t quite as strong: 51% support such demands by employers while 39% oppose.

By 45%-22% Texans are more likely to support an elected official who backed a mask mandate during the pandemic than they are less likely.

On the recent migrant surge 54% of voters say they support use of state funds to deploy National Guard and Department of Public Safety officers to patrol the Texas-Mexico border as Abbott ordered last March. 33% oppose.

Among the critics of Abbott’s Operation Lone Star is poll respondent Denise Rodriguez of Houston.

“It’s a waste of money a waste of the troops’ time” she said of the governor’s deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers at the border.

“I’ve seen that some of them have even committed suicide that they’re not getting paid or having trouble getting paid” said Rodriguez 56 a disabled auto parts store saleswoman who said she’ll vote for O’Rourke.

A plurality of voters (48%) agree that a wall along the border is necessary for a safe border while 37% disagree. However 52% of voters believe the state’s commitment to extend a border wall at a cost of $20 million per mile is either a waste or involves money that would be better spent on technology. Another 36% say the pledge by Abbott and state lawmakers to extend the border wall is reasonable.

By 51%-28% Texans support granting permanent legal status to immigrants who entered the country without authorization when they were children.

Governor

Ahead of the March 1 GOP primary the poll showed Abbott in position to win renomination to a third term without a runoff.

Republicans support Abbott at a 59% clip compared with 6% for former state GOP Chairman Allen West 4% each for former Dallas state Sen. Don Huffines and Parker County conservative activist Rick Perry (not the former governor) and 2% for Blaze TV host Chad Prather. Three others drew support from 1% or 2% of Republicans and 21% of such voters were unsure whom they support.

Asked what attribute makes them like their GOP pick for governor over the other candidates Abbott’s supporters most frequently cite his experience. The backers of West a former Army lieutenant colonel most often mention his service. Huffines who’s the only Abbott opponent who’s done much advertising is equally admired as conservative a contrast to the incumbent and someone who’s pledged to phase out local property taxes.

Some Republican respondents confused Perry whose actual name is Ricky Lynn Perry with James Richard “Rick” Perry who served 14 years as governor and as U.S. energy secretary under former President Donald Trump. They touted the other Rick Perry’s experience and likeability.

“I haven’t known him to do negative in his other terms” retired Gilmer doctor’s office assistant Janice McCormick told the UT-Tyler Center for Opinion Research. When told Friday that Perry the former governor isn’t running McCormick said:

“I’m definitely confused yes because I would definitely just keep our governor that we have. Gov. Abbott has been good to the Texas people.”

McCormick 63 praised Abbott as “the one who wants to do more with keeping the [border] wall and the immigration under control.”

On the Democratic side O’Rourke is supported by 58%; Beaumont pastor and community activist Michael Cooper by 6%; and former Austin public radio journalist Joy Diaz by 4%. Five other candidates garnered 2% or less and 27% of Democratic voters were not sure.

Among voters of all stripes 36% view O’Rourke favorably and 45% see him in unfavorable light.

Attorney general

Despite his mounting legal troubles Paxton gets a 62% job approval rating from Republican voters. Overall 42% of voters approve of how Paxton handles his job as the state’s top lawyer while 39% disapprove. 35% are unsure if he has the integrity to serve as attorney general 32% agree that he does and 33% say he doesn’t.

In the GOP primary Paxton is supported by 33%; Bush the current land commissioner by 19%; Gohmert a 17-year U.S. House member from Tyler by 8%; and former Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman by 7%.

Advertisement

Among Democrats former ACLU attorney Rochelle Garza of Brownsville and former Galveston Mayor Joe Jaworski are tied for the lead with 11%. Trailing are former Harris County Criminal Court at Law Judge Mike Fields (7%) and North Texas civil rights lawyer Lee Merritt (6%). A whopping 55% were not sure whom they support.

Lieutenant governor

Like Paxton two-term GOP Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick enjoys narrow approval 42%-39% of the job he’s doing in the state’s No. 2 job. In his primary though Patrick is backed by 42% of Republican voters. That compares with 3% for Denton County businessman Todd Bullis and 2% each for conservative activist Tracye Bradford and Texas secession proponent Daniel Miller.

Two others drew 1% support while 48% of GOP voters were unsure.

In the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor state Rep. Michelle Beckley of Carrollton is backed by 17% of primary voters; and Houston businessman Mike Collier who came within 3 percentage points of beating Patrick last time by 13% and state Democratic Party Vice Chairwoman Carla Brailey of Houston by 11% Another 53% say they aren’t sure whom to support.

Agriculture commissioner

In his bid for a third term Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller has a lead among Republicans though 63% of GOP voters say they’re not sure whom they’ll support in the primary. Miller draws support from 25%; state Rep. James White of Hillister from 6%; and Brenham farmer-rancher Carey Counsil 5%.

Other politicians

As in previous polls passions run higher pro and con for Texas’ junior U.S. senator Ted Cruz than for the longer-tenured John Cornyn. Both are Republicans.

Advertisement

Among all voters Cornyn is viewed favorably by 39% and unfavorably by 28%. Cruz’s net favorability is 44%-45%.

Vice President Kamala Harris is underwater in Texas viewed favorably by 37% of all voters; and unfavorably by 53%.

The poll is the first of at least five planned for this year’s midterm elections by The News and UT-Tyler.

Of the 1082 respondents 41% are Republicans; 32% Democrats; and 27% independents. By race and ethnicity the voters sampled break down like this: 56% non-Hispanic whites 26% Hispanics 13% Blacks and 2% Asian Americans.

A plurality of the sample 25% said their main source of news is cable news. By more than 2-1 such respondents say they listen to Fox News over CNN. The cable news junkies cited their allegiance as follows: Fox News 55%; CNN 26%; Newsmax 8%; MSNBC 7%; OAN 3%; other 1%.

And 12% of voters surveyed said that social media is their main source of news. Of them 42% said Facebook is their go-to; 17% Instagram; 10% Twitter; 10% YouTube; and 6% Reddit.

CORRECTION 7:10 p.m. Jan. 30: An earlier version of this story had incorrect polling numbers for the Democratic primary race for lieutenant governor. Mike Collier was in second place with 13 percentage points followed by Carla Brailey with 11 percentage points.

Methodology

The Dallas Morning News/UT-Tyler Poll is a statewide random sample of 1082 registered voters conducted between January 18-25. The mixed-mode sample includes 276 registered voters surveyed over the phone by the University of Texas at Tyler with support from ReconMR and 806 registered voters randomly selected from Dynata’s panel of online respondents. The margin of error for a sample of registered voters in Texas is +/- 3.0 percentage points and the more conservative margin of sampling error that includes design effects from this poll is +/- 3.5 percentage points for a 95% confidence interval. The online and phone surveys were conducted in English and Spanish. Using information from the 2020 Current Population Survey and Office of the Texas Secretary of State. The sample’s gender age race/ethnicity education metropolitan density and vote choice were matched to the population of registered voters in Texas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9jb2x1bW5zLzIwMjIvMDEvMzAvZ3J1bWV0LXdoZXJlcy1hYmJvdHRzLWNhbXBhaWduLXBsZWRnZS1oZWxwLWZvc3Rlci1raWRzLzkyNDAxNzYwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grumet: Where's Abbott's campaign pledge to help foster kids?,"Gov. Greg Abbott has been firing off a flurry of campaign promises lately.

A Compact with Texas Seniors unveiled Jan. 13 in Georgetown.

A Taxpayer Bill of Rights unveiled Jan. 17 in Atascocita.

And the one you’ve probably heard the most about a Parental Bill of Rights announced Jan. 20 in Lewisville capitalizing on the manufactured controversies over school library books and history lesson plans.

Apart from announcing a modest workforce training program however Abbott hasn't provided any assurances this month to the Texans most dearly and directly entrusted to the state’s care: foster children.

The appalling conditions for some foster kids are back in the headlines after federal court-appointed monitors issued a new report on the temporary facilities for kids who don’t have a foster home.

The Department of Family and Protective Services is caught in a terrible loop: Unsafe foster care facilities have been closing a good thing but now Texas is scrambling to find other places to send children who have been removed from their homes. The result: a sharp uptick in the use of unlicensed or stop-gap facilities some of which appear to be wholly unfit as well.

U.S. District Judge Janis Jack who is overseeing a decadelong class-action lawsuit over Texas’ battered foster care system lamented at a Jan. 11 court hearing: “We’re just going from bad to worse.”

The monitors’ 56-page report is a devastating read. It describes “children’s rooms (that) resembled juvenile cells.” It describes another group home next to a block of abandoned houses with graffitied walls missing doors and shattered windows. It describes facilities that fail to give children their medication or fail to keep medication logs at all. It describes a 15-year-old who was moved 16 times from one facility to the next over the span of three months. It describes teens being shuttled to facilities in Arkansas or Michigan because no foster home in Texas had an opening for them.

It all seems a million miles away from the children’s issues animating Abbott lately: the pearl-clutching over LGBTQ-friendly library books and the angst that parents are supposedly seeing “their roles in the classroom diminish.”

Abbott’s Parental Bill of Rights says parents should have the right to see all school instructional materials (something the state education code already ensures) presumably so they can object to any lessons that don’t align with their values.

Meanwhile at one of the overflow foster care facilities Texas uses in Michigan the program handbook scolds traumatized foster kids as if they are juvenile delinquents. “You can look at the issues in your life that have put you into this situation and make a decision to change the thoughts that lead to negative behaviors” the handbook says. “It is these negative behaviors that led you here in the first place.”

Abbott’s Parental Bill of Rights calls for a state constitutional amendment enshrining the obvious: “Parents are the main decision makers in all matters involving their minor children.”

Meanwhile Texas’ foster care system often fails to provide essential services that could help children stay with their parents. Since 2017 the monitors’ report said Texas parents have relinquished custody of 4661 children — making a heart-wrenching decision to send their own kids into the foster care system — because they could not get the mental or behavioral health support the kids needed.

Abbott’s Parental Bill of Rights says parents should be notified of their rights to send their children to charter schools magnet schools or schools in other districts — information parents can already access.

Meanwhile at least 99 Texas foster kids were shuttled to out-of-state facilities last year without any say in the matter owing to the lack of foster care options here. The distance made it harder for case workers to connect with them or to notice signs of trouble. After visiting Texas teens at a Michigan facility and hearing about the extreme use of restraints there the monitors reported five separate complaints to that state’s child abuse hotline.

A panel of experts issued about two dozen recommendations this month to improve the foster care system some of which would require more money from the state. Ultimately those funding decisions rest with Abbott and lawmakers.

I recognize foster care systems are chronically underfunded and understaffed even as they are charged with the emergency care and placement of youths with extraordinary needs. As much as anything though foster kids suffer for their political invisibility. They aren’t a courted constituency like seniors taxpayers and culture warriors.

But a governor who invokes family values and an abiding respect for life as Abbott does should be the first to fight for foster kids too.

NEW DELHI: Construction and operation of buildings are responsible for 38 per cent of global emissions and there is an urgent need for solutions to help accelerate decarbonisation of the urban-built environment to limit the global temperature rise to below 1.5°C the World Economic Forum said in a paper on Friday.The paper produced in collaboration with Accenture  also noted that numerous technologies exist to help decarbonise the sector but there is an urgent need to accelerate investment to implement these solutions at scale in cities around the world.The paper has proposed a more holistic decision-making approach recognising the importance of social and environmental outcomes as well as system performance.With over half of the world's population living in cities and producing over 70 per cent of carbon emissions cities play a key role in combatting climate change the WEF said.It said some leaders in sustainable buildings have started to consider social and environmental impacts in their decision-making and many obstacles to investment in net-zero buildings still relate to financing both real and perceived.The WEF said its 'Net-Zero Carbon Cities Building Value Framework' seeks to accelerate investment by overcoming these barriers.The paper also cited examples including of the Belgian real estate company Extensa using complementary solar and geothermal technologies to renovate and refurbish an old railway station in Brussels.In another case study from Turin Italy it said a municipality in collaboration with leading smart energy service provider Enel X retrofitted municipal buildings for energy efficiency and on-site renewable generation.Geneva-based WEF which describes itself as an international organisation promoting public-private cooperation said the flexibility of its Building Value Framework means it can be used for the retrofit and refurbishment of existing buildings as well as for the construction of new buildings.""The urgency to transition the world's cities towards a net-zero carbon future is abundantly clear. The Building Value Framework presents an approach to help accelerate the investments needed to deliver a greener urban built environment"" it added.If the world is to keep pace with limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5oC compared to pre-industrial levels a transition to a clean electrified world is needed"" the WEF said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9qb2JzL2Itc2Nob29scy1jbGFzcy1vZi0yMDIyLXNlY3VyZXMtdG9wLWdyYWRlcy1vbi1oaXJpbmctc3RyZWV0L2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg5MjE0MDcxLmNtc9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9qb2JzL2Itc2Nob29scy1jbGFzcy1vZi0yMDIyLXNlY3VyZXMtdG9wLWdyYWRlcy1vbi1oaXJpbmctc3RyZWV0L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84OTIxNDA3MS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,B-schools' Class of 2022 secures top grades on hiring street,Final placements at the country’s leading business schools are seeing one of the strongest seasons ever despite the ongoing third wave as improved business outlook unleashing of pent-up demand and overall optimism sparks a surge in hiring across sectors pushing up average salaries to record highs for the Class of 2022.At IIM Kozhikode average salaries have shot up by around 30% from last year despite the institute having to place its largest batch till date – 546 students across three programmes. Bhavan’s SPJIMR saw a 23% jump in average salary to Rs 32.05 lakh with 59% of the offers above or equal to Rs 30 lakh; IIM Indore had a record-breaking average salary of Rs 25.01 lakh.Highest packages across these campuses also saw an upswing. At MDI Gurgaon the top offer this time was around Rs 80 lakh a nearly 82% jump over last year’s Rs 44 lakh. In IIM Kozhikode it went up by over 28% to Rs 61.5 lakh (international) up from last year’s Rs 48 lakh.“Placements have been exceptionally good this time; industry is not bothered by the third wave. The appetite for hiring is much higher than the last two years” says Amit K Gupta lead- graduate programme placements at MDI where the average salary is around Rs 25 lakh for the graduating batch. All companies have upgraded salary packages and the institute has had to refuse many firms who were keen to recruit he says.Campuses say that not only are regular recruiters hiring in large numbers but there has also been a significant surge in first-time recruiters. Boston Consulting Group Bain and Co McKinsey & Co Cognizant Accenture PwC Deloitte Amazon and ITC were among prominent recruiters across campuses.“Consulting sector has been on a hiring spree this year. More fintech companies are recruiting and product management is another role which is in big demand” says Qambar Abidi placements chairperson at IIM Kozhikode.As the pandemic accelerated a push towards digitalisation the placements reflected the new trend.“While the IT/Analytics domain itself saw a boost in recruitment even other domains like finance marketing operations and strategy are witnessing roles being offered that have a higher digital flavour than ever before. This is representative of the overall shift in industry focus” said Himanshu Rai director IIM Indore.The euphoria has spilled over into other campuses as well. IIT Kanpur’s MBA programme has had a 22.5% growth in average salary this year breaking all previous records. Symbiosis Institute of Operations Management at Nashik has also seen a strong run.Top institutes where placements are yet to wrap up vouch for the same bullishness. “The overall placement trend shows that the hiring market is upward. There is more demand coming from the consulting and product management domains. The CTC levels are expected to be higher for this season and we are also anticipating more hiring numbers per recruiter” says A Kanagaraj chairperson placements XLRI

The university and companies like Amazon and Spotify allow you to take advantage of your “.edu” offering a number of free subscriptions services and discounts. You know how it goes: the classic “we pay Vanderbilt $80000 per year” to “they give us a $1 monthly New York Times subscription for free” pipeline.

But in all seriousness we all know how penny-pinching being a college student can be and every dollar we can save counts. We at The Hustler don’t gatekeep so here are some of the free subscription services you can get with your beloved Vanderbilt SSO.

HBO Max

Did someone say “Euphoria”? The “Sex and the City” reboot? “Big Bang Theory”? Some people feel isolated from the pop-culture conversations about these iconic series probably because they aren’t up for paying the equivalent of one meal swipe ($9.99) per month to purchase HBO Max on top of Netflix and all the other lingering subscriptions they probably forgot about. It’s me I’m people. Of course this was until I discovered that Vanderbilt gives us HBO Max for free. Simply go to the website or download the app to access all the raved-about series and movies. Go to “Log in” and click “Xfinity” as the provider to be taken to the on-campus providers’ section. Happy streaming.

New York Times (NYT)

NYT is one of those subscriptions that charges you legitimately only a dollar per month to read their stuff. Maybe this is just me but charging one dollar per month makes me less inclined to subscribe than if they charge $10? It feels too silly to take my credit card out for five minutes for a $1 charge. Just make it free at that point right? As such I’m convinced free news sources single-handedly hold society on their backs (*cough* YOUR Vanderbilt Hustler). I digress. Log in using your Vanderbilt Gmail save $12 a year I guess.

Wall Street Journal (WSJ)

Similar to NYT WSJ charges you $1 per month to read their articles. Now you can save not just $12 but $24 per year. Just in case you have a vendetta against one or your teacher assigns you a ~current event~ reading on WSJ specifically now you have both. Voila. Login using your Vanderbilt Gmail.

Financial Times (FT)

Just the name of this website gives me east-coast-investment-banking-finance-bro vibes. A niche demographic but I know there’s at least one of you econ major business minor Goldman Sachs summer analyst people reading this. Login using Vanderbilt Gmail.

Headspace

It’s no secret that along with serving up top-tier degrees Vanderbilt education can come with a whopping side of stress and anxiety. Unlike other Vanderbilt-recommended stress-relievers (like virtual board games) Headspace actually works (I’ve tried it). Headspace provides science-backed meditation tools and offers hundreds of mediation courses and singles. Courses include everything from “self-esteem” to “acceptance” to “managing financial stress” and are designed to help bring you peace with whatever you’re dealing with. Headspace premium is $7.99 per month but you can get free premium access with your Vanderbilt SSO login.

Microsoft Office

Although I’m admittedly a sucker for Google Suite for some reason Brightspace still has not figured out a way to enable us to upload a Google Doc. And so I need Microsoft Word Powerpoint and Excel. However those cost $100 per year—just for me to do some word-processing. I will say though that OneNote is my personal favorite computer application. Through the Vanderbilt software store get Microsoft Office for free. Follow instructions on the software store website.



Adobe Creative Cloud

Canva is great and all but for any of you who have Adobe Photoshop or Indesign experience in the past you know some things just simply cannot be done with pre-templated designs. Unfortunately the magic of Adobe comes out to $76.99 per month which is in fact $74.99 more than Canva per month. Through the same software store website as used for Microsoft office you can get Adobe Creative Cloud for just $19.99 for being a Vanderbilt student.

Amazon

We’ve all been there—a last-minute flapper dress for a Great Gatsby guest party a bikini for your Cabo spring break trip or some accessories for your sorority bid day that you just now remembered you needed. Enter: Amazon Prime. We know her we love her but most of us can’t afford her for $12.99 per month (despite being able to afford a $20 10-pack of phone wallets “just in case”).

While Vanderbilt doesn’t offer anything special here Jeff Bezos kindly gives students six months of free Amazon Prime. That’s like only eight fake email addresses you need to create while you’re at Vanderbilt.

Apple Music and Spotify (+Hulu and Showtime)

Whether Lil Baby at your early-morning Rec workout or white noise in Buttrick for a late-night study session most students appreciate a good soundtrack at some point in their day. Regardless of whether you’re an Apple Music or Spotify human being a student benefits you.

Apple Music offers 50% off their normal price of $10 per month but despite being an avid Apple Music user myself I have to admit that Spotify’s deal takes the cake. Spotify offers Premium access while partnering with Hulu and Showtime to give you access to those platforms as well all for a bundled deal of $4.99 per month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vc2lhY2hlbnN0dWRpb3MuY29tL2xpc3QvYmVzdC12aWRlby1lZGl0aW5nLXNvZnR3YXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video Editing Software: 10 Best Video Editor In 2024,"Videos are trending all around the world.

Nowadays mini PCs have evolved to include gaming-level specifications and other powerful features. The Beelink GTR5 is the latest high-performance mini PC from the manufacturer equipped with an AMD Zen 3 Ryzen 9 5900HX processor that is typically reserved for powerful gaming laptops like the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 SE Lenovo Legion 7 16 or the Gigabyte A7 X1. To see such an option for a 0.8 L form factor PC should automatically make the GTR5 one of the fastest in its category should everything run as advertised.

The GTR5 is currently on Indiegogo ranging from $620 USD for a barebones kit up to $950 if fully configured. All SKUs come with the same Ryzen 9 5900HX processor. The GTR5 should not be confused with the GTR7 which is actually an older Beelink model running on the much slower Ryzen 7 3750H.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

Imagine working on the same set as the Sam Elliott. We're talking the legendary actor known for his debut roll in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and of course his signature mustache. Well we're in luck because 1883 actor Eric Nelsen just gave fans the inside scoop of what it's like working with Elliott while on set.

Eric plays Ennis on the Yellowstone spinoff 1883 streaming on Paramount+. The show follows the Dutton family as they travel west and stars Tim McGraw Faith Hill Sam Elliott and more. As an experienced cowboy Ennis helps the Dutton family during their travels and eventually falls in love with the oldest daughter Elsa Dutton.

In an interview with Town & Country Eric revealed how surreal it feels to come on set and be surrounded by actors he always admired while growing up. ""To see your name on a cast chair on a show of this magnitude is a pinch me moment—and then when you get to see it sitting next to some of your biggest icons and idols in music and television and movie history it takes your breath away.""

Later in the interview Eric gushes about being able to work on a project set in the most beautiful landscapes of Texas. Being able to ride horses and watch Texas sunsets sounds like a dream to us too! Even with all of these ""pinch me"" moments Eric goes on to describe the moment he met some of his idols.

""Sam [Elliot who plays Shea Brennan on the series] is probably the most down to earth giving man you'll ever meet. He's not one to hide out in his trailer. He loves to just be sitting out there with everybody. Even when he's done filming and his scenes are wrapped he hangs out supports all of us watches the rest of the scenes for the day.""

Now it was Tom Hanks who made Eric shiver in his cowboy boots. Hanks made a special appearance on the second episode of 1883 and before filming on set like many starstruck fans Eric wanted to get a photo with the legendary actor.

""Still feels like a dream. Tom Hanks welcome to @1883official. I was speechless when I heard he’d be joining our show… Get ready things are about to get wild in the west"" Eric captioned his photo.

The 30-year-old actor has won Emmy and Tony Awards during his career but Eric admits that 1883 has garnered a larger fan reaction that he could have expected. With the success of Yellowstone we're not surprised. After the latest episode we're excited to see what the Dutton family has in store for viewers.

But if they could at least call dibs on one of their own free agents who would it be?

According to Pro Football Focus it should be cornerback Stephon Gilmore.

In identifying a player each team simply cannot afford to lose salary cap analyst Brad Spielberger chooses the former AP Defensive Player of the Year for Carolina.

“The Carolina Panthers traded a 2023 sixth-round pick to the New England Patriots for cornerback Gilmore and paid him roughly $6 million for the second half of the season” Speilberger writes. “Gilmore was immediately tasked with covering the opposing team’s top players and rose to the challenge with a 79.4 coverage grade and zero missed tackles. With a young secondary that includes 2020 first-round cornerback CJ Henderson and 2021 first-round cornerback Jaycee Horn Gilmore could be a great veteran mentor for both.”

PFF graded Gilmore out at a 77.1 overall mark which was good enough to rank him 14th amongst 134 qualifying players at his position in 2021. Over his eight games the 31-year-old allowed 15 catches for 155 yards and two touchdowns (along with two interceptions) over 22 targets.

In addition to Gilmore the Panthers may also have decisions to make on two more defensive starers—fellow corner Donte Jackson and outside linebacker Haason Reddick. A few of the team’s other notable free agents include defensive tackle DaQuan Jones linebackers Jermaine Carter Jr. and Frankie Luvu center Matt Paradis and quarterback Cam Newton.

According to Matt Schneidman of The Athletic the Packers will replace offensive line coach Adam Stevanich – who will be promoted to a new role as offensive coordinator – by promoting assistant offensive line coach Luke Butkus.

The departure of Nathaniel Hackett Matt LaFleur’s offensive coordinator for the last three seasons necessitated the internal changes. Hackett left Green Bay to be the Denver Broncos new head coach.

Butkus was hired by LaFleur as the assistant offensive line coach under Stenavich in 2019. He’s been Stenavich’s top assistant for the last three seasons providing a seamless transition on LaFleur’s staff.

Before coming to Green Bay Butkus spent three seasons as an assistant for the Chicago Bears (2007-09) two seasons as an assistant for the Seattle Seahawks (2010-11) and three years as an assistant for the Jacksonville Jaguars (2013-15). He also spent four seasons at Illinois his alma mater as the offensive line coach (2012 2016-18).

In college Butkus was a two-time All-Big Ten selection at center. He played briefly at the NFL level for the Bears and Chargers and also had a stint playing in NFL Europe.

The Packers are also expected to lose quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator Luke Getsy meaning more internal promotions are likely coming. It’s also possible tight ends coach Justin Outten will depart to join Hackett’s staff in Denver.

Thinking of jumping into the short-term rental market in the Hudson Valley? Get expert advice from these Airbnb hosting pros.

You already knew the Hudson Valley was a magnet for travelers. But did you know the area scored ninth on Airbnb’s Top 10 list of the most profitable U.S. locations for new hosts? And that was just in the first six months of 2021. If you’re mulling over renting out a home to offset the mortgage get a sense of how much you can charge by going on AirDNA.co (or from Airbnb itself). Then get the lowdown on how to be successful from these savvy Valley-based superhosts:

Look into your town’s rules

“Know the area and whether short-term rentals are a risk for regulation. Many of the towns in the Hudson Valley have started to explore putting strict policies in place” advises Stephen Beck who rents out Willow Vale House in Pine Plains. Most of that ire is directed at absentee investors but at the very least you’ll probably have to fill out an application to register the home as a short-term rental and then answer any questions from the planning board as well as submit to inspections notes Catherine Wolpe host of Long Pond Cottage in Rhinebeck. Since that takes time “it’s important to begin three or more months before your desired start date” she adds.

Get friendly with the neighbors…

If you’re from out of town and your place needs sprucing up introduce yourself to your neighbors and tap into their network of local contractors Wolpe says. A neighbor can also lend a hand by stopping by to check if something needs attention when you can’t get there says Tina Roth Eisenberg who rents out a cabin in Red Hook and has a person she can count on.

…Then get your team in place

Stuff happens: “Fuses are going to blow drains are going to get clogged something’s going to break at some point” says Austin Urban Airbnb host of the Barn at Copake Lake as well as an apartment in Hudson. So keep a list of reliable pros in place and have a couple of backups for every electrician plumber and handyman he advises. Kathy Corby owner of Lilac House in Saugerties has a spreadsheet of 31 contractors that she depends on including appliance repair people and folks who assemble furniture.

Get a cleaner—and a system

Finding the right cleaner can make all the difference: “They can make or break your business” says Dyanna Rettig owner of the Dharma Dome in Kerhonkson. But she doesn’t stop there. She went through each room of the geodesic dome and “made a list of every single thing that needed to be cleaned between guest visits. It’s a great way to make sure that nothing gets missed when you’re on autopilot” she says.

Start small or go for longer-term stays

Once you begin renting you have to stay on top of all the moving parts—the guests who are booking leaving arriving plus anything that needs to be fixed in between rentals. To avoid becoming overwhelmed Rettig advises doing fewer reservations at first at least until you get into a groove. And Beck discovered that increasing the minimum stay to five nights reduced the number of booking requests to manage. One downside to that strategy: “With longer stays comes more issues with guests to sort out including damage wear and tear and plumbing and heating issues” he says.

Craft a welcome message

Many hosts send out pre-written messages to guests as soon as they book sharing Wi-Fi passwords parking info important details about the house and area and even options for hiking shopping and eating out. People appreciate getting a guide from the get-go says Urban. But it also helps you get a sense of your guests. How? Roth Eisenberg’s message asks guests to send her a quick text after they arrive. “I’ve only had issues with guests who have not followed that simple rule. It usually means they also don’t read any of the other house instructions” she says.

Follow the golden rule

Treat your guests the way you’d like to be treated. Besides providing the basics—shampoo soaps toilet paper and linens—as well as supplies a guest may have left at home (like a charger or sunscreen) add thoughtful details. “We provide firewood for the fireplace anything you might need to cook or make coffee and stock the house with books and records” says Danielle and Ely Franko who own three properties in the Catskills including their newest the Cabin. Corby sets out a gift bag with Birch Benders pancake mix local maple syrup homemade blueberry preserves scented candles even packets for the fireplace that changes the colors of the flames. “If owners don’t have energy to put into really making it a great experience for their guests they probably shouldn’t host” notes Corby.

Decorate with guests in mind

You want your place to feel homey while playing up its strengths whether it’s the natural light or rustic nature. The Frankos decorated the Cabin with bigger pieces from West Elm along with as many “found objects” as possible either from Craigslist or their parents’ garages to bring a sense of life and history. “You definitely want to use quality well-made furnishings as they do get a lot of wear and tear” advises Samantha Orley who rents out Cranberry Pond in Livingston Manor. And because she assumes that guests will feel free to use whatever’s in the house she limits personal items like small ceramics artwork and even coffee table books which may add to the vibe but will be hard to replace if they get lost broken or even taken.

Get feedback no matter how negative

“Every single time guests stay at your house ask them what you could have done better to make the stay better” advises Urban. Roth Eisenberg does the same. “I get really wonderful suggestions” she says like the guest who told her the pillows were too hard. She got softer pillows and now guests have a choice of where to rest their heads as they snooze. There are a lot of traits that go into being a good host—being organized getting back to guests quickly keeping the house running without (too many) glitches. But above all say these hosts you have to put in the time and enjoy sharing your space with people. “Renting at any scale is definitely not ‘low-touch’ or ‘passive’ and we pride ourselves on the care and consideration we put into the property and our job as hosts” says Orley.

Longtime neighborhood resident Troy Farrell had adopted Nubbins — his ""support cat [...] that was my friend"" — several years ago. When looking into purchasing a house Farrell noted that they were sold when Nubbins came scratching at the door during a showing asking for attention. The following years showed the bond between Farrell and Nubbins deepen.

But that relationship was severed after a couple staying at an Airbnb two doors down from Farrell's residence allegedly took the outdoor cat back home with them... more than 500 miles away back to SoCal.

According to ABC7 Farrell has been fighting for the past three months to get his cat back home. Farrell had first noticed Nubbins was missing when he got back from a trip earlier last year. Canvassing the community neighbors told him that guests staying at nearby Airbnb asked about Nubbins while seeing her out in the area. The unnamed couple renting the Airbnb ""[loved] the cat"" — so much so that they somehow thought it was alright to take her with them when they checked out.

Farrell said he got a call this past November from a vet in Long Beach confirming they had his cat but couldn't send her to him; when the SoCal vet had scanned Nubbins for a microchip it produced Farrell’s home address and phone number.

The vet's office which is a member of Veterinary Centers of America said it has ""legal obligations to the client who initially brought in the cat the person with whom a Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship was established — a relationship that is governed in California by the state Veterinary Medical Board."" This appears to be why the cat was then given back to the former Airbnb guests as opposed to Farrell.

The neighborhood has also rallied to get Nubbins back by filing a report with the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office. The SoCal vet office also noted in a shared statement with the news outlet that it’s ""fully cooperating with the Sonoma County Sheriff's investigation.""

Alas it’s still TBD on whether or not Nubbins is reunited with the Railroad Avenue-located community she was taken from — but here's hoping the cat will again be scratching at Farrell's back door sooner rather than later. Becuase... like... maybe you shouldn't hold someone's adopted microchipped pet hostage? Just a wild crazy empathic thought.

Home security footage obtained by The Post shows multiple gunshots suddenly ringing out around 1:45 p.m. Saturday in New City — as a man blows snow from his front walkway.

Several people can be seen fleeing the home where the shooting occurred and running down the street.

The man blowing snow then realizes what is happening and runs inside.

Sources told The Post that the suspects were part of a rap music video being filmed at 3 Turnberry Court which had been rented on Airbnb.

Officers from the Clarkstown Police Department arrived at the home on the call of shots fired and saw a black Mercedes fleeing officials said in a statement.

3 The man was removing snow from the front of his home until he heard gunshots fired nearby. Ring.com

Police chased the car until it hit a utility pole at which point all five suspects inside bolted in different directions on foot police said.

Clarkstown police and deputies from the Rockland County Sheriff’s Department worked together and collared all five suspects within minutes of the initial 911 call according to police. Four handguns were recovered during the arrest.

Sources told The Post that an additional 10 guns were uncovered inside the home.

3 The man was frightened by the incident. Ring.com

All five suspects are from Brooklyn. One of them is a minor. Their identities were not immediately made available by law enforcement. Charges were pending the suspects’ arraignment police said.

In the surveillance video a woman could be heard screaming in the distance when the gunfire stops.

“What was that?” she screeches.

The man returns to his snowblower out front and tells someone inside his home to close the door.

3 The man panics and runs to call the police. Ring.com

Another neighbor runs down the street and yells “Call 911!” several times.

“The black car is leaving!” he added.

“Stay inside” the man tells the neighbor adding that the police are being contacted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vdGhpbmdzLXRvLWRvLWluLXV0YWgvMjAyMi8wMS8yOS9tb3N0LWxpa2VkLWhvbWUtYWlyYm5icy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The most-liked home on Airbnb's Instagram is in Utah,"(Provided by Airbnb) The most-liked home in 2021 on Airbnb's Instagram page is the Zion EcoCabin in Hildale Utah. This elevated A-frame cabin is entirely open on one side so residents can more fully appreciate the view of nearby Zion National Park.

Editor’s note • This article is part of 150 Things To Do a reporting project and newsletter exploring the best that Utah has to offer. Click here to sign up for the 150 Things weekly newsletter.

Each of the 10 most-liked homes on Airbnb’s Instagram in 2021 is unique.

No. 9 is the Mineral Boutique IV Cabin a double-height timber-clad cabin in Mineral del Chico Hidalgo Mexico. No. 5 the Woodlands House sits on five acres of private forest in Sandy Oregon. And No. 2 is in a tree — the Raven Rock Treehouse in Fletcher North Carolina.

But the No. 1 most-liked home in 2021? The Zion EcoCabin in Hildale Utah.

This elevated A-frame cabin is entirely open on one side so visitors can more fully appreciate the view of nearby Zion National Park.

As of Aug. 28 2021 Airbnb’s post about the Zion EcoCabin had over 61000 likes well above No. 2′s 39000-plus likes earlier in the year.

Zion EcoCabin owner and Hildale resident Mindy Rae Barlow said taking the No. 1 spot on Airbnb’s list is motivating and “puts the pressure on.”

“As a host I want to make sure that guests get the luxury experience that I strive to offer” she said.

An authentic outdoor experience

Barlow said an EcoCabin provides an “authentic outdoor experience” while preserving the natural landscape.

For instance the Zion EcoCabin is constructed on columns to have minimal impact on hillside vegetation she said. The building crew reused wood and tin from prior projects. And the hot tub is an EcoSpa which claims to be the most energy efficient in its class.

Barlow and her husband have made a business out of building and running EcoCabins in the area.

She and her husband got their start in 2017 she said when they sold their home and moved in with his parents just so they could purchase property from a friend.

From there her husband’s basketball coach gave them a small loan to build the first EcoCabin in May 2018 she said.

“I wanted to provide a unique accommodation that gives travelers the opportunity to experience the incredible outdoors while also giving the comfort of a luxury king size bed” Barlow said.

That first EcoCabin paid for itself within a year she said and the profits went towards building the next EcoCabin then the next one. And between late 2020 and July 2021 they finally built their “most beautiful ambitious” project: the Zion EcoCabin.

It has hosted just over 100 guests since opening for reservations in July 2021 Barlow said. Airbnb shows it goes for $645 a night.

It has also only recently become difficult to book. Dates become available one year in advance so Barlow recommended that potential visitors keep an eye out for 2023 openings and check out the other cabins she and her husband offer.

“They have the same design and the view is incredible” she said.

She thinks the Zion A-Frame has the best view however and is what has made the location so popular.

“It gives that Zion feel. It borders public lands that will never be developed” Barlow said. “You might even see hikers or horse-back riders on the small path that goes up through the valley.”

Some of her favorite local spots are Maxwell Park the Water Canyon Trail and the North Reservoir.

The Water Canyon Trail in particular “gives Narrows vibes it’s pet friendly and it’s easy to get to.”

Creating lifetime memories

Barlow and her husband have big plans for the future. She currently is working on a master’s degree in marketing to further her business skills she said and hopes to be an “industry standard” in the future — “someone who others can turn to.”

They also are exploring the idea of offering ATV tours and ultra-luxury upgrade packages that would include perks like a personal chef and a private yoga instructor.

Ultimately Barlow said she strives to be the best host she can be.

“The goal is to let travelers create memories that will last a lifetime” she said.

(KPIX) - A man in Sonoma California says his cat was stolen by Airbnb renters in his neighborhood and even though the cat was found miles away he can’t get her back.

“I just want my kid back. I want my friend back. She’s my friend” Troy Farrell said.

Troy Farrell was in tears thinking about his cat Nubbins. He misses her every day.

“I’d go outside stressed out and burnt out and she’d just come running and sit on my lap” Farrell said. “She’s like my support cat. And they stole her.”

Farrell said a Long Beach couple rented an Airbnb two doors down in October.

When they left he said they took the outdoor cat with them.

Farrell was out of town at the time.

When he returned a veterinarian called him after scanning Nubbins’ microchip.

“I’m like Nubbins is in Long Beach? She didn’t walk to Long Beach nor did she like hitch a ride” he said. “You know what I mean? How on earth is she in Long Beach?”

The Long Beach couple apparently took the cat in to the clinic for a health check.

The vet returned the cat to the couple and asked them to contact Farrell but they refused.

“Those are evil people. Those are people without a conscience those are people without a heart” Farrell said.

Farrell filed a cat-napping report with the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Department.

The clinic that contacted Farrell said they fully cooperated with the sheriff’s department. And an investigator told Farrell they forwarded the case to the district attorney’s office.

Three months later Farrell is still waiting for Nubbins’ return.

“I don’t have kids. She’s my kid and she’s seen me through so many things. And they took her and I want her back” Farrell said. “… The second I’d open that door or drive up the driveway or go out back … There’s Nubbins just in my lap.”

Farrell said he won’t give up.

If law enforcement doesn’t act he said he may hire an attorney and a private investigator to get Nubbins back.

A report from independent tech firm Akamai (via TheWrap) revealed the most illegally downloaded films of 2021 with Warner Bros. titan mash-up Godzilla vs. Kong taking the top spot as king of the monsters and king of the pirated feature films. Despite these piracy metrics the film was still a rousing success bringing in over $460 million at the global box office.

According to Akamai five of the top 10 most pirated movies were releases from Warner Bros. including Zack Snyder's Justice League (an HBO Max exclusive) the reboot of Mortal Kombat The Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman 1984 (technically a 2020 release). Only one Marvel Studios movie appeared on the list however Marvel's Black Widow with three other Disney films making the Top 10 Cruella Raya and the Last Dragon and Jungle Cruise. The only other studio with a title on the list was Universal Pictures with F9 cruising to a Top 5 spot. You can find the full list of the most pirated movies of 2021 below.

Godzilla vs. Kong Zack Snyder's Justice League Black Widow F9 Mortal Kombat (2021) The Suicide Squad Cruella Wonder Woman 1984 Raya and the Last Dragon Jungle Cruise

Godzilla vs Kong marked the first big movie to be released in theaters in 2021 arriving just as vaccine rollout began in earnest in the United States. The sequel a culmination of seven years and three other ""MonsterVerse"" movies brought in over $100 at the domestic box office and nearly cleared $470 million globally and paving the way for an eventual follow-up movie and even a TV series spinoff that's in the works at Apple TV+.

What's perhaps the most surprising about this list of the most pirated movies of 2021 are the omissions. Not present is Daniel Craig's final James Bond movie No Time to Die nor Dune Venom: Let There Be Carnage or Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. All of these films made more money at the global box office than some of the films that did make the list perhaps lending credence to Disney's report that they lost $600 million to piracy on Black Widow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8va2V2c2Jlc3QuY29tL2Jlc3Qtd2luZG93LWNvbXBhbmllcy1pbi1ob25vbHVsdS1oaS_SATpodHRwczovL2tldnNiZXN0LmNvbS9iZXN0LXdpbmRvdy1jb21wYW5pZXMtaW4taG9ub2x1bHUtaGkv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Best Window Companies in Honolulu HI,"Below is a list of the top and leading Window Companies in Honolulu.

“Tropical Wholesale installed four eco windows of which I am very pleased. So much so that I approached the owner to install a walk-in shower as a result of my wife breaking her leg. Both projects were completed to a high standard at a reasonable price and promptly. The varied staff involved were respectful and capable. I would not hesitate to use Tropical Wholesale again should the need arise.” – Sam F.

Today Paramount+ has released a trailer for the new show giving fans their best look yet at the live-action Master Chief and the show’s attempt to recreate the world of the video game.

Most recently they were spotted leaving restaurant Craig's where the Daily Mail says they shared a romantic meal together.

Schafer was dressed all in black with shorts over tights a sweatshirt and black leather jacket on top. They also wore a pair of mid-calf boots. Fike was wearing a black t-shirt and brown jacket and a matching pair of boots with some simple jewelry. Both wore cloth face masks.

On Saturday January 15 the pair were seen leaving a West Hollywood restaurant called Nice Guy again holding hands. One fan said they saw Fike and Schafer “kissing and dancing” at the restaurant which was attended by a number of other celebrities.

Fike's character Elliot was introduced on the first episode of Euphoria's second season. He plays another teen who meets Zendaya's character Rue on New Year's Eve and the two become drug buddies together. It's been hinted in a few early episodes that Elliot and Schafer's character Jules might have some sort of romance ahead this season so life imitates art.

In the past Schafer was romantically linked to model Massima Dee though their relationship was never confirmed. Fike has discussed dating social media personality Shelby Tangorra and Booksmart's Diana Silvers. Fike described his relationship with Silvers to GQ.

“On our first date we talked about Paul McCartney and I hadn’t talked about Paul in so long or The Beatles” he said. “It kind of manifested the Paul feature. I was trying to make stuff to impress her and work with people that she had heard of.”

Tang Mingfang 43 was jailed after he revealed how the Foxconn factory in the southern Chinese city of Hengyang used schoolchildren working illegally long hours to manufacture Amazon’s popular Echo Echo Dot and Kindle devices.

Now after spending two years in prison he is appealing to the higher courts to clear his name. He has taken the difficult decision to talk publicly despite being aware of the risks of reprisals because he believes Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos have a responsibility to support his appeal and that the Observer also has a responsibility to highlight his case.

Tang who is married with a nine-year-old son said his father – who died while he was in prison – would have wanted him to speak up when he saw young workers being abused.

“My father always taught me that I should be a good person and because I followed my heart and believed that justice should be served I reported the serious violations at Hengyang Foxconn. Yet my imprisonment has caused such great harm to me and my family” he told the Observer.

He described how he was beaten by his interrogators handcuffed in stress positions until he could take no more and signed a confession to the crime of infringing trade secrets.

“I refused to sign seven times and they got angry and handcuffed me to the bottom of the iron frame unable to stand squat sit; only bending half squatting all night. In the early morning I could not stand any more” he said.

“I think Amazon should give me an explanation tell me if I really deserve to be sent to jail? If not Amazon should give me an apology along with its partner Foxconn to assist me to appeal for a redress and provide compensation.”

Amazon did not answer specific questions put by the Observer but a spokesperson said: “We do not tolerate violations of our supply chain standards. We regularly assess suppliers using independent auditors as appropriate to monitor continued compliance and improvement – if we find violations we take appropriate steps including requesting immediate corrective action.”

Illegal working practices at the factory were first revealed in an investigation by the Observer and the US-based China Labor Watch in 2018. A year later a second investigation found that Foxconn had tried to solve its subsequent recruitment problems by drafting in schoolchildren to work illegal overtime.

Internal Foxconn documents passed on by Tang formed the basis of the second investigation. Amazon sent its own staff into the factory to investigate the labour law breaches and Foxconn was forced to pay more than £165000 in compensation for underpaying workers making Echo and Echo Dot devices in Hengyang.

Meanwhile Foxconn brought in the Chinese authorities to investigate the leak. Tang was charged convicted and jailed for two years. He said he believed Amazon acted correctly in addressing the illegal working practices but that it should have intervened on his behalf in line with US law offering protection to whistleblowers and guaranteeing their freedom of speech.

When Tang’s 80-year-old father learned of his son’s imprisonment he was taken ill and although his family asked for a temporary release on compassionate grounds the request was refused. “My family wanted to give me a chance to see my father for the last time so they delayed the funeral by three days. This is my biggest regret and the main reason why I would like to keep appealing” he said.

Tang worked for Foxconn monitoring supply levels and had access to the factory computer system. He said he came across information showing how Foxconn was using temporary workers and schoolchildren to cut costs.

“I was also clear about how the student workers were physically punished and assaulted by their teachers. I believe these things are wrong and illegal” he said.

He said workers regularly exceeded the limit of 36 hours of overtime in a month with some on the assembly lines exceeding 100 hours a month during busy periods.

Tang said Foxconn had promised to improve working conditions after the first investigation but its own internal documents suggested managers were planning to expand the illegal use of workers. “Not just me many other colleagues believed this is wrong” he said.

“I read a report written by a security guard at Hengyang Foxconn; basically it talked about how a teacher verbally and physically assaulted a non-cooperative student in front of everyone and the student cried.”

After talking to colleagues about what was going on in the factory Tang contacted China Labor Watch and agreed to share some of the company documents which he photographed using his mobile phone.

After the story broke he said Foxconn’s management launched an investigation laid off most of the temporary workers and students and offered rewards to workers who helped to recruit new staff.

People he spoke to in the factory told him managers were furious. Unknown to Tang they started to review CCTV footage to try to identify the mole.

On 16 August 2019 he was arrested for the first time. “I was very scared because I had never experienced anything like this; especially after I was handcuffed I began panicking” he said. He was questioned for two days before being released and returning to work. A month later he was arrested again at the factory and taken into custody.

He said that before his arrest he saw a foreigner whom he believed to be one of the Amazon staff going through his desk drawer and checking the pockets of his uniform on his chair.

Tang claims the statements used to convict him were obtained by the use of torture and should not have been admissible in evidence.

In a written account of his treatment he wrote: “While I was detained in the police station for questioning I endured tremendous physical and mental stress. The officers at the police station used corporal punishments and violence during the interrogation to force me to change my statement and say that I did commit the so-called criminal activities.

“The police officer battered me multiple times during the interrogation he repeatedly slapped and hit me in my face and in the back of my head.

“I was also tortured during the interrogation process when I refused to collaborate and admit to their baseless accusations.”

He said his interrogators repeatedly handcuffed him in stress positions. “I could not stand up because my hands were chained on to the little desk that connected the two armrests I could not do anything but suffer through such grave pain” he said.

He said he signed a confession after being handcuffed to a bed overnight and because he feared he would be beaten again.

Tang said he initially received a sympathetic hearing from the police when he explained that he had only acted to expose illegal activity in the factory and said he understood they were simply doing their duty.

He said the charge of infringing trade secrets requires the company to have suffered a loss but Foxconn had only been forced to refund what it was required to pay by law. He said for that reason – and that he had acted to expose illegal activity – he refused to accept he was guilty of that charge and he insists the confession used to convict him was obtained illegally by torture by a senior officer aided by auxiliary officers and for that reason his conviction should be overturned.

All Tang did was report violations of workers’ rights in an Amazon supplier factory. He did not commit any illegal acts Li Qiang China Labor Watch

Tang said Amazon had members of staff in the factory who he believed were aware of what had happened to him. Although he admitted passing on company documents he believed he was acting to prevent law-breaking.

“Because I believe the cause of all [this] is that I exposed Hengyang Foxconn’s illegal activities I believe I am not guilty” he said.

In a letter to Bezos – who is worth an estimated £137bn – Tang urged him to ensure that workers’ rights were protected. “Although the price was too high for me I think the price I paid will all be worth it if only this situation can be brought to your attention and benefit the employees of all Amazon suppliers” he wrote. “Finally as your faithful admirer as a former employee of your company’s client as a victim as a son husband father I would like to ask the following of you. Please ask Hengyang Foxconn to face up to its own problems apologise to me and come forward and communicate with the local court to assist me in the appeal of my case so that the court can finally revoke my guilty verdict.”

China Labor Watch director Li Qiang also wrote to Bezos urging him to intervene on behalf of Tang. “CLW believes that Amazon has the responsibility to call for China to free this innocent volunteer who provided the evidence of labour violations in an Amazon supplier factory and thank him for helping improving workers’ conditions. All he did was report violations of workers’ rights in an Amazon supplier factory. He did not commit any illegal acts.

“It is unacceptable and unfair that Tang Mingfang is serving jail time for trying to help Amazon improve the labour conditions in its supplier factory.”

He said Bezos had not responded to his letter and Amazon had not offered any support for Tang.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmUuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbW92aWVzL2cyNzEwMzY0Ny9iZXN0LWNvbWVkaWVzLW9uLWFtYXpvbi1wcmltZS12aWRlby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Best Comedies on Amazon Prime 2023 - Funny Films on Amazon Now,"Every product was carefully curated by an Esquire editor.

The biggest gainer from this phenomenal return is Tadiran's controlling shareholder and CEO Moshe Mamrud (69) with a 64% stake currently worth some NIS 2.4 billion.

Nevertheless Mamrud says that realizing any significant proportion of his holding is not on the agenda as far as he is concerned. He says that the Tadiran still has plenty of room to grow both in its existing air conditioner business and in synergetic activities chiefly in renewable energy an area the company has entered in the past few years through a number of substantial acquisitions.

""I don’t think that Tadiran's share price is high in relation to where our business stands"" Mamrud told ""Globes"". ""I'm very optimistic about the directions the company is taking proud of the decisions to exit some businesses and looking forward I see very strong numbers in the coming years and I'm convinced that anyone who invests in the company will see good value.

""When we reached a market cap of NIS 1 billion I was told 'You should sell shares that won’t repeat itself.' I said at the time 'No way' and the same thing when the company reached NIS 2 billion and NIS 3 billion and now it's nearly at NIS 4 billion. The music can't be stopped. We're moving forward I feel that we're in the right businesses and I get up each morning with the enthusiasm of a sixteen year-old. I'm not an opportunist but the builder of a company for the long term.""

What about bringing partner into the business?

""I've been married for 40 years to the best partner in the world my wife. I don't want more partners. I think that the company is run in exemplary fashion. The company is liquid and doesn't need cash and isn't jumping into anything that isn't in its core businesses. I need to continue to make sure that Tadiran continues to grow and be good for my investors.""

""Italian acquisition - an important day for Tadiran""

Tadiran's core business is importing marketing and selling air conditioners. The company also deals in manufacturing and development and in maintenance of air conditioners chiefly under the Tadiran brand and also under the Amcor Toshiba and Spectra brands. In addition the company imports markets and distributes electrical appliances under the Amcor and Crystal brands an activity it may sell in the future.

In the past few years the company has been determinedly expanding its activity in renewable energy and within less than two years it has made acquisitions to the tune of NIS 300 million. The latest deal which Tadiran completed last week is the acquisition of control (60%) in Italian renewable energy company VP Solar for €32 million (NIS 115 million).

Mamrud: ""Completion of the takeover of the Italian company is a special and important day for Tadiran because it thereby becomes an international company and from here we start moving towards Europe in line with our strategy and thinking. VP Solar is strong in solar energy and the biggest energy storage company in Italy with about a third of the market.

""Today Tadiran focuses on several strong areas. We read the market and understood that it was looking for as many alternative source of energy as possible and accordingly two years ago (May 2020) we presented a strategic plan concerning the areas that we would focus on which besides air conditioning included expanding to Europe entering renewable energy and dealing with air pollution.

""We bought businesses and put our hands on the right companies to acquire which we estimate will help us reach annual turnover of NIS 2 billion in 2022 even though when we presented the plan we set a goal of reaching turnover on that level within five years.""

With the support of the acquired businesses Tadiran saw a 36% rise in revenue in the first nine months of 2021 in comparison with the corresponding period of 2020. Revenue reached NIS 1.1 billion while net profit grew 31% to NIS 111 million.

""To make money and also save the world from destruction""

A substantial acquisition that Tadiran made in early 2021 was of 75% of Eliran Solar from its founder Eliran Tyito for NIS 55 million. Within the past few weeks Tadiran has bought the remaining 25% of the company for a much larger sum of up to NIS 90 million so that Tyito has ultimately made an impressive NIS 150 million exit.

Eliran Solar sells products for solar energy systems such as panels aluminum installation infrastructure devices for producing maximum power from the panel current converters and other accessories.

How do you explain the jump in the valuation at which you bought the company?

Mamrud: ""Tadiran Solar is a company that according to the results for January to September 2021 generates annual revenue of NIS 400 million with a profit of NIS 40 million. We had a call option on the shares and after I had studied the company well since the acquisition I asked the founder Tyito if he would like to bring the sale forward. We quickly reached an understanding because he felt that done all he could and wanted an exit.

""Tadiran Solar (Eliran) sells to installers in Israel all the equipment needed for solar power installations from the smallest screw to the largest panel exactly as needed. It's like Tadiran Air Conditioners which sells air conditioners to anyone who needs them but doesn't do installation. After the acquisition I moved it to a new place in Kiryat Gat and built it in accordance with Tadiran's language. We'll develop products of our own that will generate as much power as possible from as little sunshine as possible.

""We're a leading player in the home solar market. Today anyone who has a house a warehouse a logistics center or other property and doesn't put solar panels on the roof it's as though they're throwing money away. This is a business in which you can both make money and save the world from destruction. Everyone should take this personally and help to produce electricity from the sun instead of polluting. Today if you put solar panels on your roof the state commits to buying electricity from you for twenty-five years so you can return the investment within six to seven years.""

""We'll go into energy storage at full speed""

Through Tadiran Solar the group has also acquired energy storage company Aviem Systems for NIS 30 million. The acquisition price could reach NIS 56 million depending on future performance.

Mamrud: ""The combination with it and the acquisition in Italy give us an advantage. The next thing for us in energy is to go into storage at full speed. In Israel revenue in the storage market in 2021 was negligible; estimates for this year are that sales in this market will be $100 million and the expectation is that within seven to ten years the energy storage market could reach NIS 6-7 billion.""

What's your formula for a successful acquisition?

""Sometimes even when you can see synergy with potential companies in practice after the acquisition you encounter lots of problems mainly because of the owners. But we've made good acquisitions with good people. I'm good at sizing people up and where I spot a good person I buy.""

What about the risks?

""Tadiran is in a safe business - if the sun shines the company will flourish. People will have to continue using air conditioning the world is pushing towards alternative energy and pollution creates demand for treatment.""

""Air conditioning has become a basic consumer product""

With all due respect to the renewable energy business Tadirna's bread and butter and the basis of the rapid growth in its profits and value is air conditioners in which the company has been active since 2009 when it bought the activity of Tadiran Consumer Products (then called Crystal Consumer Products) from US company Carrier for just NIS 16 million.

Does the entry into renewable energy indicate that you project limited growth in the air conditioners business?

Mamrud: ""Certainly not. There's a huge opportunity in the air conditioners market for several reasons. In the past two or three years air conditioning has become a basic consumer product. When I bought Tadiran (in 2009) it was considered a luxury for people with average income and above. What has fueled our growth is that air conditioning has become the main thing in the home.

""Tadiran's factory in Afula specializes in producing a mini-central air conditioner for the whole home and this factory currently works round the clock except on Shabbat because demand is crazy. In every home and office people want to install this type of air conditioning and the market is growing stronger. Apart from that we import wall-mounted air conditioners from China.

""Construction is taking place in Israel at a crazy pace and it's also exceptionally worthwhile replacing old air conditioners with new ones because the old ones are power guzzlers and noisy whereas the new ones are economical and quiet. The replacement market is limitless.

""Tadiran has two million air conditioners installed in homes in Israel and every year we put 400000 air conditioners on the market.""

Do you intend to sell air conditioners overseas as well?

""When I bought Tadiran I decided to operate only in the local market and to halt the export activity because it wasn't built correctly and well. At that time I didn’t see a partnership with which to do international business and the payment ethic wasn't to my satisfaction. I work for the long term and today I want to go into Europe through acquisitions and build up a business. This is one of the reasons that we bought the Italian company. This is a longstanding business that specializes in solar energy and also deals in heat pumps and has started to deal in air conditioners. Italy is the biggest market in Europe for air conditioning and my vision is that this company will be just like Tadiran in Israel. It will have all the legs - solar energy heat pumps and air conditioners - and it will be a platform for air conditioning activity all over Europe.""

""We're becoming a player in environmental quality as well""

Mamrud sees part of Tadiran's growth potential in the air purification activity that it is developing. ""Tadiran is becoming a player in environmental quality as well. Five years ago when I saw that I led in air conditioners I thought what else can be done with it besides warming and cooling and we decided to go for air treatment. We developed a product that sits in the air conditioner and can clean a space of viruses (including the coronavirus) dust and other things protecting children and old people. Our capabilities are backed by all the labs in the world.

""We're going to offer a product that has all the means of cleaning the air rapidly and not at a high cost up to NIS 1000 and without maintenance. You install it in the air conditioner and for several years it will deal with the cleanliness of the air in the home. We have set up a separate division for this activity and we'll shortly put the products on the market. We already have more than twenty contracts around the world a representative in the US who committed to buy air purification components to the tune of $70 million and agreements in Japan Italy Korea and other places.""

They have a promotion for Loyalty Points.”

The UPS driver stood there looking at me. Well looking at me and at the five boxes of wine on my front porch that he had just delivered. All at once.

“See American Airlines is running a promotion where they award miles based on purchases. And there’s status too which can do cool things for you when you fly…and I guess there’s a lot of wine deals and…”

I trailed off right when I realized that I sounded like I had already been imbibing and it was probably best to quit while I was way behind. He asked me if I was 21 had me sign the scanner and walked away shaking his head. This is what the the AA Loyalty Games has done to me. If anyone needs a bottle of wine I have 30…and almost 15000 AAdvantage Loyalty Points (halfway to Gold Status).

There’s a lot to “wine” about

American Airlines may not want to serve you alcohol on their planes but they’re absolutely thrilled to sell you some through the AAdvantage Shopping Portal. We’ve already had five 2000+ points opportunities in the first four weeks alone. There’s been a lot of questions about each of these offers and some issues with getting some of them to trigger so we wanted to go through each one and give a summary of costs and potential pitfalls. I volunteered to take one for the team because you know wine.

A couple of brief notes before diving in. First I’ve tentatively organized these from first to worst based on an unscientific blend of the cost per AAdvantage point the cost per bottle the ease of triggering the offer and how simply (or quickly) the membership can be canceled. Second I didn’t factor in any credit card rewards or subtract any opportunity cost. It’s simply the cost of the deal divided by points and bottles. Finally a best practice with all of these sorts of deals is to immediately go into your account to delay the next shipment as far into the future as you can. That way you have plenty of time to allow everything to track without having to worry about getting an unwanted second shipment.

Offers you can shake a corkscrew at

The Deal: 1500 miles with order through AAdvantage eShopping with first time wine club membership. Additional 1000 miles through SimplyMiles (could be targeted).

Credit Card Stacking: Citi Merchant Offer of $20 back on $30 spend

How to trigger the offer: You start by taking a “wine quiz” to get wines that are paired to your tastes. You then order the new member offer of four bottles of wine for $29.96. With tax your total should be more than $30 and thus trigger the Citi Merchant Offer. If there is no tax in your state click “I want to choose my own wines” and find a bottle that costs $1 more. Once the order was complete points appeared within 24 hours.

Online cancellation: Yes on website via chat

My Cost: $12.21 (or 3.05 per bottle)

Cost Per Point: 0.48 cents

Be aware:

Clicking through AA you will get you 4 bottles for $29.96 + tax.

Members who have previously subscribed are not eligible.

Note that this offer may be repeatable

Keep in mind that this is a subscription. Remember to cancel.

The Deal: 3700 miles with order through AAdvantage eShopping with first time wine club membership

Credit Card Stacking: Amex Offer for $40 off $80. You must add additional wine to hit the minimum. (Amex Offer Expired – and it’s much simpler without it anyway)

How to trigger the offer: This is a bit of a tricky one. After clicking through you’ll get to a landing page that offers you a “Discovery 6 Pack” for $39.99+tax. This doesn’t trigger the Amex Offer but WILL trigger the AA miles. So you can go the easy route and take the 6 bottles and the points. I wanted to trigger the AMEX offer as well so I clicked the link at the bottom of the page that enables you to add more wine. The problem is that once you add a second item the free shipping goes away until you have four items in the cart – and the Discovery Pack only counts as one item. So you have to add three total bottles minimum to get the free shipping to kick back in. There is another issue in that the website shows you a discounted “Angel Price” that goes away once you add an item to the cart that already has your case in it…the two discounts don’t stack. So pay attention to the undiscounted price. Bottles start at $11.99 (for cheaper sweet wine) and I was able to add three bottles between $12.99 and $13.99 to bring the total after tax to $84 for 9 bottles. Points posted within 24 hours.

Online cancellation: Yes on website

My Cost: $44.63 (or 4.95 per bottle)

Cost Per Point: 1.2 cents

Be aware:

Many readers have had the miles clawed back and it isn’t completely clear how to avoid it. See comments around here (including before and after the linked comment). It seems that the clawbacks either relate to pasting the URL from the Amex offer into the post AA portal clickthrough or with cancelling your first “Angel Contribution” immediately. I just used the AA portal and paid with my Amex without copying and pasting which triggered the Amex offer anyway. I pushed my first Angel contribution out as far as possible and haven’t had anything clawed back.

While this doesn’t sign you up for a club it does auto-sign you into a monthly $40 contribution to your account. Remember to cancel although the balance is refundable if you forget.

Final Thoughts

There you have it a fuzzy-headed road map to three cases of wine and 15000 AAdvantage miles. There’s probably a couple that I wouldn’t do again especially after having to explain all this to my wife but I’m sure that there will be a few tasty discoveries that we’ll make in spite of it. If you’re into trying new wine there are some fun opportunities.

Even if you’re not into portalling your way to a new cellarful be sure to check out Nick’s definitive guide of AAdvantage deals for the full non-alcoholic smorgasbord of AA delights as well as Greg’s incredible spreadsheet for tracking the loot.

The United Aviate Academy is the first flight school owned by a major U.S. airline. United welcomed its first class of students which is made up of 80% women or people of color.

""Our pilots are the best in the industry and have set a high standard of excellence"" United CEO Scott Kirby said in a press release. ""Recruiting and training even more people who have that same level of talent motivation and skill is the right thing to do and will make us an even better airline.""

The academy provides an important source for recruitment as the industry faces a potential shortage of around 34000 pilots globally by 2025 according to analytics firm Oliver Wyman. The shortage will result from an aging pilot population and career changes for furloughed pilots who couldn't wait for the airlines to rehire them.

United projects that the academy will train around 5000 new pilots by 2030 – fulfilling half of its plan to recruit 10000 new pilots in that time to combat the shortage.

American Airlines (AA) launched its Cadet Academy in 2018 which works with partner schools and provides financing to help aspiring pilots earn their license and eventually find employment at a major carrier.

""We continue to increase our pilot hiring efforts this year and beyond and are continuously investing in both our pilot training and cadet academy programs"" an AA spokesperson told FOX Business. ""Our goal is to grow the pilot population incrementally and remove barriers for students while creating greater diversity amongst the future and current pilot ranks.""

AA also told Fox that the company hired more than 500 pilots in 2021 and expects to recruit more than 2000 in the coming year.

What You Need To Know Electric cars face some drawbacks during the winter months



Using the heating system in the colder temperatures reduces the vehicle's range the most



There are ways to help limit the loss of range during the winter months



Automakers and researchers in the industry continue to look for better ways to maintain battery life

The cold winter months take a toll on all cars electric or not. Heavily salted roadways put wear on the paint and underbody. Both fall victim to low tire pressure and there's no technological enhancement that can help us escape that one. At least not yet anyway.

With the goal of having more electric vehicles on the road in the years to come the U.S. continues to give big incentives for those looking to own and operate one. Yet many Americans are still warming up to the concept.

Adding winter to the equation only seems to magnify those concerns. And let's keep in mind that a decent amount of the population deals with some form of ""winter"" season.

Winter woes

I am a proud driver of a 2017 Ford Fusion Energi an electric hybrid car that roughly gets about a 20-mile range on just battery power alone.

Yet living in the Northeast I notice a significant decrease in the battery life once the temperatures drop below 40 degrees. Lucky for me my car doesn't solely rely on battery power alone.

According to Matthew Lum automotive technical engineer for the American Automobile Association (AAA) driving in the cold accounts for the biggest reduction in the car’s range.

The battery is less efficient in frigid conditions. But this is not the only reason. It is also because of its management system. This prevents the battery from discharging all its capacity helping to preserve the longevity of the battery pack itself.

However the biggest culprit to reducing the car’s total range is by running the heating and cooling systems.

In 2019 a study by AAA examined how five different electric vehicles performed when driving in 20-degree temperatures. They found that an electric car’s range fell about 12% when driving with all heating systems turned off. In contrast when a driver turned on the heat the vehicle’s range fell by 41%.

Preserving the range

The good news? There are many measures you can take to help limit range-loss during the winter months.

Lum explains that if possible you can opt to use the heated seats instead of running the car’s heater.

Parking in a garage can also prevent the car’s cabin from becoming as cold which reduces the demand to put the heater on full blast.

Additionally for those heading out on a long trip preheat the vehicle beforehand while it is still in the charger. This will help warm up the car’s interior putting less stress on the battery.

Winter weather driving

While it is not every day that drivers face extreme situations such as the recent I-95 backup in Virginia winter weather is notorious for causing major backups on the highways and interstates.

That said it is critical that drivers and passengers should always prepare for the worst-case scenario before hitting the road including the possibility of being stranded in their vehicle for an extended period.

Plan your next trip wisely

Before taking your EV car for a spin you’ll want to plan out your trip carefully.

Keep the desired destination well within the range the car can travel on a fully charged battery leaving plenty of extra mileage to spare in case you encounter traffic delays and detours.

For longer trips map out where the nearest charging stations are along your desired route. Pin which ones you plan to stop at along the way and always have a backup plan.

Most importantly always pay close attention to the weather. If the forecast favors colder temperatures and inclement weather please consider delaying or rescheduling your trip at a safer time.

Despite some downfalls EVs offer a plethora of advantages. With more room to grow there is only hope that new technological advancements will continue to expand the industry while ironing out the kinks.

Lum hopes that “as the capacity of electric vehicle batteries continue to increase there will be less impact on driving range in the colder temperatures.

“Industry researchers and automakers are continuing to explore new battery chemistries other than the Lithium-ion that may be less susceptible to efficiency losses with respect to temperature.”

So while there are still ways to go in the electric car market just remember that gas-fueled vehicles still face drawbacks as well during the winter months and look how long they have been around.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS81MC15ZWFyLWFnby1hbWVyaWNhcy1lbmdpbmVzLWxvc3QtdXAtdG8tMTMwLWhwLW92ZXJuaWdodC1oZXJlcy1ob3ctaXQtaGFwcGVuZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,50 Year Ago America's Engines Lost Up to 130 HP Overnight. Here's How It Happened,"In 1972 carmakers switched from gross to more realistic net power ratings making cars look punier and even now people are confused

One night half a century ago cattle rustlers from the Society of Automotive Engineers busted in to garages dealerships and factories across America and made off with thousands of horses.

Not physically of course but that’s what it looked like on paper. A change in the way engine power was calculated meant that some cars appeared to have suddenly lost up to 130 hp overnight despite the actual specification of the engines in many cases not changing at all.

Fifty years on this switch still causes confusion when people make the mistake of trying to compare the different kinds of figures which results in even ordinary 1960s cars appearing far more potent than they were and over exaggerates how much performance suffered due to the effects of emissions legislation from the beginning of the 1970s to the middle of that decade.

But how did this come about and what were the implications for American car buyers? Unbutton your shirt slot a Led Zeppelin album in the eight-track and let’s journey back to the dawn of the 1970s to find out.

Related: Detroit Switched To Unleaded Fuel 50 Years Ago Here’s How Horsepower Took A Hit

By 1970 Detroit’s four carmakers had been engaged in an all-out horsepower war for well over a decade and engine outputs had reached outrageous levels. Some of those numbers were deliberately underrated such as the Camaro Z28’s 290 hp to appease insurers racing organizations and politicians while others were inflated for marketing purposes.

But more confusing was that all were “gross” horsepower figures calculated on a test bench in a state that bore little resemblance to how they operated when fitted to a car. Power was measured with the spark and fueling optimized no air cleaner or restrictive exhaust fitted and and no power sapping fan to turn. Think of it as the automotive equivalent of a famous music producer auto-tuning your awful bathtub wailing into something capable of topping the charts. Yeah it’s you singing but that’s not how you really sound.

What it meant is that customers couldn’t be sure exactly how much horsepower they were getting but many of them were getting much less than they were promised and politicians in California didn’t like it. In 1970 California passed a bill that demanded automakers quote “net” horsepower calculated using S.A.E Standard J245 when communicating engine power to customers in advertisements brochures and manuals starting with the 1972 model year. But rather than quote one power figure for the Golden State and another for the rest of the country Detroit’s Big Four opted to quote the new “net” hp figures across the board.

Instead of testing engines on benches like they were prepping your aunt Betty’s Caprice for a qualifying session at Daytona automakers would generate power numbers with intake manifolds at operating temperatures with the fan and air cleaner installed and the spark advance set for normal use to simulate real-world conditions.

The resulting figures shouldn’t be confused with at-the-wheels horsepower numbers you might get from taking your car to a modern dyno because they’re still crank-horsepower figures (and the current S.A.E testing protocols used by manufacturers are also fractionally different to the ’72-on net figures). But they did finally promise customers more transparency.

“You could compare the situation to a test of the physical stamina of a soldier” an auto industry insider explained to The New York Times in December 1971.

“When the soldier is dressed in shorts and tennis shoes he is performing at his gross capacity. But when you load him down with his helmet uniform combat boots a 75‐pound field pack and an eight‐pound rifle he is operating at his net capacity. The Army is only interested in how well he can perform in full combat gear – not how he does when he’s almost naked.”

QOTD: Which Classic Muscle Car Had The Best Badge Or Graphics?

Some carmakers made tentative steps towards the new system in the 1971 model year and quoted both gross and net horsepower numbers. But since only the gross numbers were comparable with the power from the previous year’s cars they were the most prevalent figures. And for anyone buying a new car and wanting to brag to their buddies being able to say your new ride had 275 hp sounded a heap more appealing than admitting it was actually only packing 190.

An 85 hp loss? Well some were much worse than that. And the non-uniform differences between the old and new figures highlighted just how much Detroit had been manipulating those pre-1972 numbers. The really basic entry-level cars running economy-minded four- and six-cylinder engines weren’t hugely affected. But further up the scale there were some Grand Canyon-sized gulfs between old and new numbers.

Let’s take a look at how the change affected some well known cars. Helpfully GM and Chrysler released both gross and net hp figures in 1971 so we’re able to compared them directly. Ford doesn’t seem to have obliged so we’ve picked a couple of Mustangs that appear to have been carried over unchanged from ’71 to ’72 for comparison.

Cadillac Eldorado

The biggest loser we’ve come across happens to be the biggest engine fitted to a passenger car at that time. Cadillac’s (8.2-liter) V8 was rated at 400 hp (406 PS) in 1970 but dropped to 365 hp (370 PS) in 1971 as a result of GM slashing the compression ratio to suit low-lead fuel. But that fall was nothing compared to what happened the following year when the new measuring protocol revealed the unchanged Eldorado’s V8 actually only made 235 hp (238 PS).

Chevrolet Corvette

The Vette’s bottom-rung 350 cu-in (5.7-liter) V8 stumbled from 270 hp (274 PS) to just 210 hp (213 PS) in the shift from gross to net power according to GM’s 1971 figures and its high-performance 350 LT1 brother didn’t look like such a high performer now that it was rated at 275 hp (279 PS) instead of 330 hp (335 PS). Top of the tree was the 454 (7.4-liter) LS5 which was more honestly rated at 285 hp (289 PS) down from 365 (370 PS).

Ford Mustang

The Mustang’s entry-level 250 cu-in. (4.1-liter) Thriftpower six was rated at 145 hp (147 PS) and the mid-range 351 cu-in. (5.8-liter) V8 supposedly made 240 hp (243 PS) in 1971 the year Ford gave its pony car a redesign. Come 1972 though those same engines were now rated at just 95 hp (96 PS) and 177 hp (179 PS) respectively.

Dodge Charger

Chrysler made some fairly major changes to its engine lineups for 1972 including replacing the well-respected 383 (6.3-liter) Magnum V8 with a new 400-cube (6.6-liter) motor meaning it’s not that easy to compare the two model years. But Chrysler’s 1971 data shows that the journeyman 225 cu-in. (3.7-liter) Slant Six only claimed 35 hp more than its true 110 hp (112 PS) output while the 318 cu-in (5.2-liter) V8 promised 230 hp (233 PS) when it really only made 155 hp (157 PS).

Interestingly it also reveals a net power figure for the mighty 426 Hemi which was discontinued for 1972. Rated at 425 gross hp (431 PS) right through the second half of he 1960s until its death in ’71 Chrysler admitted it actually only made 350 hp using the new protocol though many Mopar fans believe even that number was underrated…"

Reconceptualizing beauty

By Anna Faller | Jan. 29 2022

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder or so the old adage goes. But for Michigan-based photography duo John Hanson and Joey Schultz beauty lives in the eye of the camera. “I’m a street photographer” says Schultz. “I find beauty in everybody.”

Contemporary culture however often disagrees. But what society would have us believe is beautiful — especially in how we conceptualize women — Schultz says “can be reprogrammed in our subconscious.""

And that begins with how we see age.



“I was once asked what the most powerful image I could take would be” says Schultz. “Without question [that image] would be of my grandmothers. I remember them walking hand-in-hand at my brother’s wedding; it felt like you could get radiation poisoning from how radiant they were.”

Though he didn’t snap the shot at the time it’s an image Schultz could never quite shake. “I kept on thinking about it” he says “and I thought I could make a book of strangers that focused on the profoundness — and the beauty and diversity — of our nation’s matriarchs.”

From there he proposed the project to Hanson. “I was living in Los Angeles at the time and he presented this idea to me when we were working on a [film] crew together” Hanson says. “I have a really close relationship with my own grandmother so my logistical brain started assembling how we could make this project real.”

The result is Grandmothers of America. Released in January the book compiles nearly five years of travel and more than 200 American matriarchs in an effort to remind our current generation that beauty — and the wisdom it contains — is ageless. “We just felt this cultural disconnect” Hanson says “and a generational gap especially in the age of social media. We thought that this was a way for us to use our tools to shorten that gap.”

One of those tools was old-school portraiture. “Part of the reason John and I connected in the first place is our love of analog photography” says Schultz. As such they scrapped digital gear from the get-go. “[There’s] that screen on a digital camera that can distract someone who might be a little uncomfortable” says Schultz. “Just the act of taking [each] photograph where [the women] had no way of seeing it was a way of honoring them.”

The pair applied this same authenticity to their search for the women the project would feature. “When John and I first came up with the idea I thought that meeting the grandmothers at random was the only way to make a book with real integrity” says Schultz.



So armed with a car and some filming equipment the pair set out in 2017 “all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed” he says “to learn how to convince these ladies to let us photograph and speak with them and sometimes interrupt their day.”

Not surprisingly their first few attempts were a bust. “We didn’t know how to do it” says Schultz. “It took about three days to figure it out.” In the end it came down to human interaction. “We’d introduce ourselves” says Hanson “and enter into a conversation about what advice [they] would you give to [their] younger selves.”

It was only after that sense of trust had developed that the pair would then broach the photography topic. “Even then sometimes we’d still get a no” says Hanson. But they couldn’t let a grandma go unrepresented. “We interviewed around 263 grandmothers” he says “and those who declined the portrait [have] their advice included in the back [of the book.]”

With each corner of the country accounted for the tips that Schultz and Hanson received are just as diverse as the grannies that gave them. “The beauty of [the project] was that it was ever-evolving” says Hanson.



From the ‘quintessential American image’ that often left the pair lost for words — “just the kinetic power you’d almost collapse!” says Schultz — to the grannies who gunned for the hardest truths “you never knew what to expect” says Hanson.



But one fire-cracker chili empress might just take the cake: “She looked like David Bowie with these giant sunglasses on” says Hanson. “She [ran] a multi-million-dollar chili business and had these wrinkly hands from [working] so hard her entire life. We never expected to meet a chili-pepper baron but we did!”

The skepticism they often met with however was — unfortunately — no surprise. “It’s a unique and unusual project” says Schultz “so especially in conservative areas people [would ask] ‘What are you doing? Is this a liberal-arts project?’”

Of course celebrating our Omas Abuelas and Bubbies is about as far from political as it gets. “Everyone has a grandmother” says Hanson “and everyone knows that nurturing kind of love.”



It’s this inherent ubiquity of the project that Schultz and Hanson most hope to honor. “It doesn’t matter where you’re at on the political spectrum” says Hanson. “That’s part of why we knew we needed to do this: It’s part of healing and something that brings people together.”

Luke Lists' putting turnaround fueled his first-ever victory at the Farmers Insurance Open. Here's what he fixed. Getty Images

Luke List didn’t have to think long when CBS analyst Colt Knost asked him what had changed in the seconds after claiming his first PGA Tour victory at the Farmers Insurance Open this weekend largely because the answer wasn’t hard to come by.

“Everything” List said earnestly a smile strewn across his face.

So there you have it. All you’ve gotta to do go from 189th on PGA Tour in strokes gained: putting to 8th in the field in your first victory is change … everything.

Okay sure it sounds daunting but for Luke List changing everything stopped being much of an option late last year. It was then that List 37 realized he’d been a full-time PGA Tour member for seven years and during that time he’d likely been the worst putter in professional golf.

Yes in the seven-year stretch dating back to the 2015-16 season Luke List has seven times been ranked between 150th and 200th on the PGA Tour in putting. The high watermark of that era — a 152nd-place finish — came in his first year on the PGA Tour. In the years since he’d darted closer and closer to 200th most recently averaging -.629 strokes gained: putting per round good for 189th on tour or to the layman seven spots out of DFL.

List’s stretch of putting incompetence was confounding to everyone including the man himself. In List’s own estimation his putting stroke wasn’t that bad. It wasn’t like he had the yips either. His putts just missed the mark with startling frequency.

So when List took off for the year in the winter months he decided it was time once and for all to change everything. He hired Stephen Sweeney a PGA professional and putting consultant based out of Florida and the two got to work.

“We got together in December and he was pretty much expecting me to have the worst stroke ever and yips” List recalled. “He got down there he’s like ‘Listen you’re doing what you’re trying to do really well it’s just not what you should be doing.'”

Sweeney rebuilt List’s fundamentals from the ground up during that short stretch (“I worked my butt off” List said). But soon after the work began it was time for List to return to life on the PGA Tour — time for him to see whether all that effort had paid dividends.

His first start of the year came at the American Express (yes the very same American Express Jon Rahm disgustedly called a ‘putting competition’ in a hot mic video last week) and brought with it mixed results: a T21 finish (good!) during which List ranked 51st in the 70-player field in strokes gained: putting (not so good!).

But then the tour turned to the — shall we say ‘forgiving‘ — contours at Torrey Pines for the Farmers Insurance Open and the light went on. List led the field in strokes gained: putting on Thursday a career-first and finished the week eighth overall.

More importantly the week marked List’s first PGA Tour win ever a feat that came in no small part due to a surge in confidence with the flatstick in his hands.

“I told my caddie I was happy with the week regardless the way I fought today” List said. “We’ve made such huge strides in my putting and just certain areas and mentally. Just to have the opportunity that’s all you can ask for.”

In the end Luke List changed everything and a short while later everything changed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3RvdXJpc20vdHVyYnVsZW5jZS10YWlsd2luZHMtc2h1bnQtbWFqb3ItYnVzaW5lc3MtdHJhdmVsLXpvbmUtMjAyMjAxMjgtcDU5czM00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID Travel: Flight Centre and Corporate Travel management mull North American market,"North America’s business travel market a key growth zone for Australian companies Corporate Travel Management and Flight Centre is facing a potential rollercoaster of omicron cutbacks.

Dixon’s wide-ranging expertise prompted LANL to invite him to lead the geochemistry research for and ultimately their entire contribution to the ambitious vision for a permanent nuclear waste storage facility for the United States at Yucca Mountain Nevada.

The Yucca Mountain project was intended to address the nation’s growing stockpile of nuclear waste. Dixon and his colleagues were tasked with designing a leak-proof disaster-proof storage facility that would contain tons of dangerous materials for at least 25000 years. As the LANL team program manager Dixon oversaw an annual $12-million budget devoted to creating and studying geological and geochemical tests that Los Alamos was conducting. Under two different Department of Energy (DOE) contractors Dixon was the deputy science manager for the Yucca Mountain project and managed an annual budget of approximately $85 million and support from seven national laboratories twelve subcontractors and four universities. He also briefed congressional committees and officials from four states. During the final year Dixon worked on the Yucca Mountain project he also became the technical manager of the post-closure criticality group.

Since the federal government’s abandonment of the Yucca Mountain project Dixon has applied his unparalleled understanding of hazardous waste management to a career involving safe and cost-effective cleanup of environmental contamination at former DOE weapons production sites. Dixon is currently the senior program manager for environmental sciences within the civilian nuclear program office at LANL and is also the multi-lab program manager for the DOE’s Advanced Simulation Capability for Environmental Management (ASCEM) program.

Nesbitt moved to Chicago as a General Motors Fellow to complete an M.B.A. at the University of Chicago. After earning his degree he joined the real estate investment company LaSalle Partners where he became an equity vice president within five years.

At LaSalle Nesbitt recognized the resilience of parking as a real estate asset class even during tough economic cycles and the investment opportunities associated with the way the parking industry was structured. This insight led Nesbitt to develop The Parking Spot an airport parking company which today has nearly million in annual revenue and 2000 employees. Earlier this year Nesbitt launched a new private equity firm The Vistria Group which focuses on investing in middle market companies that operate at the nexus of the public and private sectors in the education health care and financial services industries.

For 24 of his 38 years in education Richard Jones was employed as a teacher coach and principal at North Farmington High School in suburban Detroit—but what he did there reached far beyond any of those job expectations. An innovative and out-of-the-box thinker Jones implemented programs that energized and inspired not only his own students and teachers but the Farmington community and other educators across the country. Upon his retirement in 2011 North Farmington High School’s main building was renamed the Richard B. Jones Academic Center. The school’s athletic campus is also named in his honor.

Jones’ legacy includes his implementation of school year “themes” that involved students teachers parents and the community in exploration of social justice issues through numerous interdisciplinary activities. Environmentalism and sustainability civil rights and the revitalization of Detroit were among the topics studied with the goal of moving the students “from awareness to activism.” During the school’s yearlong examination of genocide Jones was co-recipient of the Anne Frank Center USA’s Spirit of Anne Frank Outstanding Educator Award. Jones and North Farmington joined forces with a high school in Danbury Connecticut together raising over $135000 to build “Promise School” in Sudan as an activism project for the genocide study.

Not surprisingly Jones has earned many awards for excellence including four Teacher-of-the-Year honors; he is also a recipient of the Great Seal of Michigan for his school’s efforts to pass a state divestiture bill regarding Sudan. He is Michigan’s 2008-09 High School Principal of the Year. Jones has been on the board of the Michigan Chapter of the National Football Foundation since 1995 and since 2004 has traveled to Mali in West Africa three times as a member of a medical team.

A Detroit native Jones spent 14 years as a teacher and coach in Bay County Florida before moving to Farmington Hills. He earned a master’s degree in movement science and sports psychology from Florida State University where he also studied school administration.

As a student at Albion Jones played varsity baseball was a member of Alpha Tau Omega and founded Albion’s chapter of Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

He and his wife Kathy are the parents of Keely and Lauren and live in Farmington Hills.

Duane Nelles ’66

Like many good economics and mathematics students Duane Nelles was attracted to the world of accounting where he quickly built a very successful career. So it may have surprised some when he turned to venture capitalism but the move proved to be beneficial both for Nelles and the little startup that caught his eye. Partially thanks to his investment and his presence on its board for nearly a quarter century the “little startup” Qualcomm has become a global leader in telecommunications supporting most wireless technologies including cell phones with all their numerous applications.

Nelles’s accounting career began in 1968 in the Detroit office of what was then Coopers & Lybrand (now PricewaterhouseCoopers). After just four years he opened Coopers & Lybrand’s San Diego office and became a partner in 1974. Over the next 14 years Nelles worked with the firm’s California-based clients while directing several administrative operations in the San Diego office.

In 1988 Nelles left public accounting to become president of a private venture capital firm in La Jolla. In that role he made many venture capital investments including Qualcomm now one of the largest companies in the world. He had further success in venture capital having served on numerous boards of directors including Price/Costco Wescorp and WFSI Financial. In addition to his position on Qualcomm’s board he is currently a board member for American Assets Trust (a NYSE-listed real estate investment trust). Over the years Nelles has served on many boards of not- for-profit organizations chairing the Salvation Army board in San Diego.

Despite the distance between San Diego and southern Michigan Nelles continues to have an active interest in Albion College. He has underwritten several alumni events in the southern California region and is an informal adviser to President Donna Randall and a leading donor to the President’s Discretionary Fund. In spring 2010 Nelles and his wife Gail returned to Albion where he divided his time between executive planning sessions and meetings with Gerstacker Institute students.

Nelles received an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan. He and Gail live in La Jolla California and Sun Valley Idaho and have two sons and four grandchildren.

2011 Distinguished Alumni Awards Recipients

William H. Dobbins ’74

Bill Dobbins loves Albion. Simply stated yet running incredibly deep there truly is no better way to describe the feeling he has for his hometown and alma mater.

A premedical student who played football basketball and baseball (and was part of the 1971 Athletic Hall of Fame baseball team) Dobbins gained admission to the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine after just three years at Albion. His medical training completed he began practicing in Marshall with his brother James Dobbins ’69. Younger brother Thomas Dobbins ’79 later joined the family medical practice that continues to serve patients today in Marshall and Albion. For a quarter-century Dr. Bill’s care and compassion for his patients were well known throughout the community–and beyond as he regularly made trips to Jackson to administer care to incarcerated individuals.

Throughout those 25 years Dobbins helped a number of Albion premedical students gain firsthand knowledge of the practice of medicine–which sometimes included picking them up at their dorms for a late-night baby delivery at the hospital. Those students are practicing physicians and physician assistants today.

In 2003 Dr. Bill changed gears taking a leadership role in the family business. Since his father Richard started Caster Concepts in 1986 Dobbins had helped grow the business and handle the financials. But becoming president and CEO meant going back to school: he received his Executive M.B.A. from the University of Michigan in 2004.

While Dobbins has successfully expanded Caster Concepts into new technologically focused areas receiving Manufacturer of the Year Awards in Jackson and Albion he has continued to give back to the community and Albion College. In 2004 he initiated the Swingin’ at the Shell summer concert series. His other community efforts include the Victory for Kids playground project and the Manufacturing Education Fund at the Albion Community Foundation. His close ties to the College’s Gerstacker Institute mean that Albion students will often be found hard at work as Caster Concepts interns.

In his leisure time Dobbins enjoys golf cycling and collecting amberina art glass. He and his wife Karen Knudson Dobbins ’74 have three children: Andrew Emily ’03 and Caroline ’12.

Bill Dobbins continues to live in the place that he loves–Albion Michigan.

Deborah Wyatt Fellows ’78

Deb Fellows promptly began contemplating the life of a writer upon graduating from Albion with Phi Beta Kappa honors and majors in English and sociology. After many months of traveling she found a magazine job in the big city … working on such inspiring titles as Industrial Waste and Water and Sewage Works.

After two years in Chicago’s trade publishing scene she moved to Northern Michigan to figure out how to wed her now-true passion for magazines with her desire to live in the beautiful northern reaches of the Great Lakes State. Not long afterward–in June 1981–with a pledged $20000 Fellows at the age of 24 launched Traverse Northern Michigan’s Magazine. From day one its mission was to share stories that celebrate and protect the natural resources small communities and unique lifestyle of Northern Michigan.

Today Fellows’ Traverse City-based company MyNorth Media employs 26 people. Thirty years after its first issue Traverse has a circulation of 30000. It has won Magazine of the Year honors from the International Regional Magazine Association as well as First Place General Excellence awards from the City and Regional Magazine Association. Traverse is also the flagship of a group of eight magazines that includes Northern Home & Cottage. There’s a book division too: published titles include Fellows’ own Reflections of a Life Up North The Cottage Cookbook and others.

Three years ago MyNorth Media launched MyNorth.com; in 2010 the Web site received nearly a half-million visitors. Earlier this year MyNorth Media was chosen as part of Folio magazine’s Folio 40 for its innovative and successful use of multimedia.

Fellows has led national webinars for Folio and she speaks at conferences around the country on such topics as blending new and traditional media. A member of Alpha Chi Omega who wrote for The Pleiad Fellows has never forgotten Albion–regularly hiring students as interns. She’s a former board member of the Leelanau Conservancy and also belongs to the smart growth-focused Elm Street Writers Guild.

Deb is married to psychiatrist Neal Fellows; they live on the shores of Lake Leelanau in Leelanau County and have four children: sons Ben Peter and Austin and daughter Olivia.

Kathryn Koegel ’78

With an unrelenting focus on other individuals as well as the community at large Kathryn Koegel continues to make an impact on the lives of many Flint Michigan residents.

She received her bachelor’s degree from Albion in 1978 and immediately became a financial assistant at her family’s company Koegel Meats which by then was already a Michigan institution having been launched by her grandfather Albert in 1916. It wasn’t her first job at the place that was already a second home of sorts: during the summer months of her Albion career she gained experience in the packaging department.

It wasn’t long before she found her true niche with the company as its No. 1 people person. Today as vice president she oversees operations which includes a particular focus on employee relations. Over the course of three decades she has also led efforts in consumer relations and community outreach executing projects on behalf of the company. Koegel’s day-to-day leadership has kept the company thriving to the tune of 250000 pounds of frankfurters and lunch meats produced and distributed every week.

Kathryn Koegel’s commitment to Flint extends well outside the factory. She is an active supporter of both the Flint Institute of Music and the Flint Institute of Arts and has served in leadership roles with the Junior League of Flint the Genesee County Historical Society and the McLaren Regional Medical Center Foundation. Koegel also played a key role in building and managing Penny Whistle Place a beloved children’s playground.

The YWCA of Flint recognized Koegel’s efforts by presenting her its Women of Achievement award.

In the time she does set aside for herself Koegel enjoys travel reading sewing and skiing. She resides in Flint Michigan.

John C. Koegel ’85

Koegel. It’s a household name in Michigan especially during summer evenings around the grill. John Koegel and his sister Kathryn Koegel ’78 are keeping it that way as third-generation leaders at Koegel Meats.

Fresh out of Albion with an economics and management degree John Koegel started working on special projects for the 95-year-old family-run Flint company started by his German-born grandfather Albert. A major assignment for the recent graduate involved setting up bar coding and scanning for inventory purposes. Before long Koegel rose into a sales manager position and in 1994 became the company’s president taking over for his father Albert Jr.

From bockwurst to Whole-E-Smokes Koegel’s nearly 60 products today account for over $28 million in annual sales at 1200-plus locations in Michigan Ohio and Indiana. The Flint factory employs 115 people. And while business practices have evolved over the course of a century Koegel has not touched the company’s commitment to delivering to individual stores thereby ensuring a fresher product.

Before settling into the family business Koegel made sure not to just settle during his time at Albion. A member of the Professional Management Program (now the Gerstacker Institute for Business and Management) he attained Albion College Fellow distinction and graduated magna cum laude. He also laced up his skates as a member of Albion’s club-level ice hockey team. Today Koegel’s free time is less grounded–he’s a private pilot and owns his own plane. He’s not always whizzing about though; he also finds enjoyment in calmer activities such as fly fishing and playing the guitar.

Koegel serves as vice president and board member of Sunset Hills Cemetery in Flint and is also a leading trustee for the city’s First Presbyterian Church. He has a particular love for the Tall Pine Council’s Boy Scouts of America. His active involvement with Scouting has included time as a den leader and on the executive board and he has received the Silver Beaver Award for his distinguished service to youth.

Along with John the Koegel household includes his wife Lisa and their four children: Katlyn Chloe Carson and Cameron. They live in Flint Michigan.

Joel K. Manby ’81

A natural: That’s an accurate phrase to describe Joel Manby. A brilliant mind and a strong business sense–atop an even stronger foundation of family and faith–have carried him to many successes in life. And more than a decade in a CEO’s corner office has done nothing to dull those qualities.

Born and raised in Battle Creek Manby went on to shine 25 miles to the east at Albion College: class valedictorian; a Rhodes Scholar finalist; Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Nu fraternity; an All-MIAA selection and member of Albion Athletic Hall of Fame teams in football and baseball; and an NCAA Postgraduate Scholar (one of only four in Division III in 1981).

Manby went to work at General Motors and two years later he was in Harvard’s M.B.A. program on a GM scholarship. Upon completion in 1985 he was back at GM helping to launch the Saturn brand. After seven years with Saturn and a two-year term with GM’s International Division he was promoted to CEO of Saab Automobile USA. After a brief dot-com calling to start the 21st century he has been on a nearly 10-year ride as president and CEO of Herschend Family Entertainment the largest family-owned theme park corporation with 10000 employees and 26 properties in 10 states.

Beyond his career commitments Manby maintains an unwavering devotion to his family as well as his Christian faith. He serves as board chairman of reThink a nonprofit dedicated to values education. Other volunteer work includes the Salvation Army’s National Advisory Board; he is also a former trustee of Albion College.

In short Manby is not your everyday boss. Millions saw that for themselves when CBS featured him on an episode of Undercover Boss in spring 2010. While learning the ropes of several customer-service jobs incognito he got to know several of his employees as well as some of their obstacles in life. By show’s end he was able to make a difference for each of them–something that has always come naturally to Joel Manby.

He and his wife Marki are the parents of four daughters: Lauryn Erin Jesse and Anna. They live in Alpharetta Georgia.

David C. Sennema ’56

Grand Rapids native David Sennema came to Albion nearly 60 years ago with a gifted singing voice and an eagerness to participate. Naturally he joined the College choir and sang in the Sigma Nu fraternity’s quartet. He graduated from the College with a deep appreciation for the arts and an amazing capacity not only to achieve but to create.

Drafted into the Army one year after graduation and stationed in Fort Jackson South Carolina he concluded that the Palmetto State was the place he would eventually make his mark. In 1964 he became the first full-time executive director of the Columbia Music Festival Association where he helped to start the South Carolina Philharmonic. And the hits kept coming: in 1967 the first executive director of the South Carolina Arts Commission; in 1970 a move to the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington D.C. to help lead state arts grants; in 1973 a stop in Springfield Illinois to create a master’s program in arts administration at Sangamon State University.

He saved arguably his best success for his return to South Carolina in 1976 when he became director of the state’s Museum Commission. There was one thing missing however: a museum. Starting with a staff of four and virtually no collections let alone a building Sennema over more than a decade of effort led the way in creating a state museum of history natural history and science and technology as well as art. The South Carolina State Museum opened in 1988 in a historic mill building in downtown Columbia.

In the 1980s Sennema launched his own arts management consulting firm. Now retired he has put his magical voice to paper as well–to date he has written 25 short stories and a one-act play.

Twenty-five years ago South Carolina awarded its highest citizen honor the Order of the Palmetto to David Sennema. It’s wholly appropriate that Albion College act similarly through this Distinguished Alumni Award.

In 2006 Sennema received the Elizabeth O’Neill Verner Lifetime Achievement in the Arts Award. Presented by the South Carolina legislature the award honors a South Carolinian who has demonstrated exceptional achievement and statewide impact through his leadership support and advancement of the arts.

David and his wife Martha live in Columbia South Carolina and are the parents of son Daniel and daughters Julia and Alice.

2010 Distinguished Alumni Awards Recipients

Forrest W. Heaton ’60

Forrest Heaton or “Wally” as he is called by his Albion classmates was known early on for his compassion leadership and love of music. An economics and political science major and Dean’s List student he was also active in Delta Tau Delta fraternity and helped to organize the Charlie Brown Orchestra on campus.

After graduation Heaton went on to a management career with Olivetti Corporation. That culminated in his leadership of the company’s management and sales education/training programs. He then founded two publishing/educational marketing subsidiaries for Prentice Hall Inc. serving as president through 1984. After joining American Express in 1985 he was appointed vice president providing leadership to American Express’ worldwide strategic account management program before his retirement in 1998.

Heaton has many passions which include writing poetry and music. Playing guitar singing and writing music led him to release a self-published DVD entitled Sweet Mary on the St. Croix and later a CD entitled Delts in Duet featuring tenors Tom Leavy and Dick Morse. He also wrote and published Heaton’s Hit Parade Songbook followed by Aunt Mary & Uncle Wally & Friends with the Young at Heart Songbook.

He married his college sweetheart Sally Ann MacArthur ’60 and together they raised three children Matthew Sara and Amanda. Sally died of cancer in 1997. Following her death he established the Heaton Endowment at Albion College which provides scholarship assistance to first-year and/or sophomore females with special interest in literature. The Heaton Endowment also provides motivation for senior women and/or men via the Heaton Prize for top honors in English. Heaton also co-chaired his 50th class reunion at Albion this year.

While living in Summit New Jersey Heaton volunteered with Stephen Ministries at the Central Presbyterian Church where he assisted pastors in one-to-one confidential ministry to members experiencing life difficulties. Through his work in this ministry Heaton met and married his current wife Mary.

He and Mary reside in Pittsboro North Carolina.

Michael A. Jurasek ’81

Mike Jurasek is an everyday hero: a community leader selfless provider of time and financial support and a family man. His story of local boy (Concord High School) becoming a star athlete at Albion College (cross country and track) and then staying to give back to the community makes him a positive role model. Jurasek’s achievements as a teacher coach and member of the community are proof that he is one of the “best of best.”

For more than 25 years he has touched lives in a meaningful way each day as an educator and coach. The academic success of his student athletes consistently exceeds the school’s norm. Through Jurasek’s skillful coaching Albion High School cross country and track teams have set school records won numerous conference titles in both the Twin Valley and Southern Michigan Athletic Conference and garnered multiple state championships.

Jurasek continues to demonstrate genuine leadership dedication and service to others in many ways. With reductions in the local manufacturing sector a majority of the students who attend Albion High School are challenged both socially and economically. He provides guidance and holds the students accountable to do their best. And he has provided the encouragement for young men and women who would not normally consider advanced education or military service to successfully pursue these opportunities. As head coach he has helped his students become collegiate athletic competitors at more than 25 different institutions.

A five-time recipient of Coach of the Year honors within the Albion Public Schools Jurasek is the director of Michigan’s Indoor Track Series and is the current selection chairperson for Team Michigan in the Midwest Meet of Champions. He is an eight-time recipient of the Kellogg Distinguished Educator Award. Jurasek remains active with Albion College cross country and track and field programs in his spare time.

He and his wife Cheryl reside in Concord Michigan. They have two children Lesley and Christopher.

Walter L. Pomeroy ’70

It is incredibly appropriate that during the Albion College Year of Sustainability Walt Pomeroy is being honored by his alma mater. On April 22 1970 just weeks before his graduation from Albion College he was a pioneer in creating and celebrating our nation’s first Earth Day. The geology major appeared on a CBS-TV prime-time special hosted by Walter Cronkite that day Earth Day: A Question of Survival. That was only the beginning of his lifelong dedication to environmental causes. He contacted activists on other college campuses who agreed that the next logical step was the formation of a student lobby for the environment. Described as “lobbyists in blue jeans” by one newspaper the new Michigan Student Environmental Confederation took its message to the state capitol in Lansing.

In 1981 Pomeroy joined the Mid-Atlantic Division of the National Audubon Society and served there as regional vice president. He remained with the society for 17 years. He was later appointed the executive director of the Pennsylvania Organization for Watersheds and Rivers Inc. where he assisted in watershed and river planning environmental clean-up activities and public education programs throughout Pennsylvania. During his professional career Pomeroy helped write and lobby for numerous state and federal environmental laws relating to water and air pollution wildlife habitat preservation and wilderness protection.

His service to his alma mater includes many visits to campus to meet with faculty staff and students. He has also participated in the Geology Department Colloquia and conducted a workshop that focused on environmental activism.

His local community service includes serving as an assistant master for his local Boy Scout troop in Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania. Pomeroy has traveled as a scoutmaster leader at the World Boy Scout Jamboree in Thailand and the Andes foothills in Chile. In 2004 he received the Boy Scout District Award of Merit for his service and leadership in the community. He continues to assist with National Audubon Society field trips as well as consulting to help watershed associations with planning and management concerns.

He and his wife Lin live in Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania. They have two sons Brian and Brent.

Bill Richardson ’62

Bill Richardson’s love of learning and humanity that began and blossomed at Albion College have influenced countless lives throughout Michigan and around the globe.

After college he taught Latin and English in the Pontiac School District at the time one of the finest school systems in Michigan. As the socioeconomic composition of the district evolved Richardson reworked his courses to address the needs of his students and provide them with the communication and research skills that would serve them well after high school. While at Pontiac Central High School Richardson also was the facilitator for Japanese and Russian language instruction as well as the coordinator of programs for the talented and gifted. During his 33 years at Pontiac Central he taught or coached more than 10000 young people.

In 1988 he was recognized by students and the superintendent of schools as a “Prominent Pontiac Teacher” for the high expectations he always held for his students. Richardson was also honored by the Oakland Community College/Detroit Edison Foundation Summer Program designed for at-risk urban students in 1993. The following year he was presented the Comcast Cablevision Educator Award for his unique use of cable television programming in the classroom. He was one of only 28 teachers nationwide selected to participate in the Satellite Educational Resources Consortium (SERC) Japanese Project Facilitators’ Conference in Omaha Nebraska.

Richardson currently works at Oakland University as the director of the summer English Language Institute in Guizhou Province China educating Chinese English teachers in China’s poorest province. Over the past 24 years he has trained more than 4000 English teachers from primary schools to university level most of whom continue to reside in the rural Guizhou province. And he has advanced international understanding through the common medium of literature as well as his open and accepting manner.

Richardson’s wife Lynne passed away in 1977. He currently resides in Waterford Michigan. He has four children—Michael William Jennifer and David ’93.

Jess Womack ’65

Jess Womack is the epitome of a liberal arts education that has lasted a lifetime. A biology major and Dean’s List student Womack discovered diverse interests that included the Albion College Players the Black Student Alliance and student government. He was elected vice president of the Student Senate and was later president of his class. His passion for humanitarian service has spanned decades and continues to benefit society.

Womack proudly served his country as a Peace Corps volunteer in Kenya and as a platoon sergeant with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam. After earning his law degree from the University of Michigan he began his career with the Ford Motor Company and later was appointed senior corporate counsel in environmental affairs for the Atlantic Richfield Company. With a lifelong interest in education Womack later accepted a role as deputy general counsel for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). Currently he is an interim inspector general for LAUSD.

Womack’s volunteer leadership has benefited countless organizations including the Los Angeles Conservancy where he served as vice president the Environmental Law Institute board and the California Lawyer legal journal as an advisory board member. His love for Albion College resulted in his longtime service to his alma mater first on the Alumni Association Board of Directors which ultimately led to his appointment to the Board of Trustees at Albion College. His passion for Albion continues today as he spearheads volunteer College enrollment efforts with Southern California alumni. His personal visits to more than 25 private high schools in Southern California last fall alone only underscores his unqualified commitment to Albion College.

His career is filled with awards and accolades. As president for the ACCA Southern California Chapter he was recognized as an ACCA Diversity Award winner. Womack also received the Distinguished Service Award from the Los Angeles Conservancy and received a similar award as president of the John M. Langston Bar Association.

He and his wife Beverley reside in Sherman Oaks California.

William R. Goudie ’63 and Janet Matilo Goudie ’64

Considered to be the quintessential Albion College couple Bill and Janet Goudie have continued to be active in College affairs. Their love for one another that began on the Albion campus has extended to include a lasting love for Albion. For over 25 years their individual and dual responses have been “yes” to virtually any volunteer request from their alma mater. They are an inspiration for students and alumni alike as the consummate volunteer couple giving freely of their time talent and treasure for the sake of Albion. Through the years the Goudies have promoted and served Albion as regional event volunteers as enrollment volunteers and as campaign committee members and annual giving volunteers in addition to serving on reunion committees. They both attend every reunion Homecoming or alumni event that their schedules allow.

The Goudies have not only been loyal volunteers; they have assumed significant leadership roles in their service to Albion. Janet has served on the Albion College Board of Trustees and is currently an honorary trustee. Bill is a past president of the Alumni Association Board of Directors and served on both the Gerstacker Institute Visiting Committee and on the Planned Giving Advisory Council. Bill and Janet’s tireless dedication to Albion is a continuation of their involvement on campus as students when Bill was active in Delta Tau Delta fraternity and served as editor-in-chief for The Pleiad while Janet was president of Alpha Xi Delta and an honors student.

After he earned his M.B.A. in finance from the University of Michigan Bill Goudie’s career led him to leadership roles in the banking industry in metropolitan Detroit.

He and his wife Bette reside in Damascus Maryland. They have one daughter Natalie.

James D. Rogers ’69

James Rogers came to Albion knowing he would pursue a career in medicine. How expansive this career would become and how many lives he would touch in the years that followed his graduation were beyond his imagination.

Rogers earned his medical degree from Wake Forest University where he received the Mosby Award for Scholastic Excellence from the Bowman Gray School of Medicine. He completed surgical residencies at Yale University and New York University. A cardiovascular surgeon he began his career as an associate professor of surgery for Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and later was an attending surgeon for the St. John’s and Cox Medical Centers in Springfield Missouri.

Rogers’ appreciation for his experience at Albion College is deep and lasting. As a “regular” at the old Eat Shop on Cass Street he spearheaded the creation of the “new” Eat Shop in the Kellogg Center to include original booths and memorabilia. As a mentor to Albion premedical students he provided them with an insider’s look at medical practice unavailable to most undergraduate students. Many Albion alumni are physicians today because of Jim Rogers’ willingness to share his insights and his passion for his work.

He and his wife Linda reside in Grand Blanc. They have four children Kathryn Taylor Harry and Dana.

Molly Ann Swart ’82

Molly Swart credits her Albion experience as a member of the Ford Institute’s first class in 1978 for having a significant role in shaping her world view her career and her life. A SOAR leader and Lomas Project 250 Award winner while a student she says Albion helped provide her with the confidence to pursue and win a $25000 Rotary Foundation Ambassadorial Scholarship for study abroad after graduation. That led to two years in Toulouse France where she learned more than just the language and culture. That experience set her on her career path in international business.

Swart’s life has personified the phrase “think globally.” After a brief stint as a technical interpreter for French foreign trade expositions Swart joined the French Embassy Trade Office/Ubifrance. Now senior trade advisor there she serves as the liaison for French industries doing business in the U.S. assisting the companies in attracting and retaining U.S. customers marketing their products and organizing banking tax accounting immigration and legal affairs. But it isn’t just business; she is a diplomat in many respects. Swart embodies global thinking in all aspects of her life from hosting French interns in her home to involving high school students in fundraising for various causes.

Washington DC – When the Biden administration revoked the “terrorist” group label from Yemen’s Houthi rebels last February it cited the potentially “devastating” effects that the designation would have on Yemeni civilians’ access to life-saving humanitarian aid.

But less than a year later President Joe Biden has said re-designating the group is “under consideration“ a move advocates and rights groups say is not only disappointing but dangerous.

“It’s extremely disappointing that the Biden administration is considering this position when they know very well the humanitarian impact it would have” Scott Paul senior manager of humanitarian policy at Oxfam America told Al Jazeera.

“A year ago the administration heeded our warnings – and nothing has changed since then to improve the outlook for what these designations would mean.”

The United Arab Emirates openly requested that the US re-blacklist the Houthis after the rebels carried out missile and drone attacks against Abu Dhabi on January 17 killing three people.

Days later during a news conference on January 19 to mark his presidency’s one-year mark Biden said reinstating the designation was “under consideration” but added “it’s going to be very difficult” to end the conflict in Yemen.

The Emirati embassy in Washington DC welcomed Biden’s pledge.

Risk of starvation

But to activists calling for an end to the years-long war in Yemen the United States president’s remark is a betrayal of his election promise to work to end the conflict – and break from the policies of his predecessor Donald Trump who provided uncritical support to the Saudi-led coalition.

That US-backed coalition which included the UAE intervened in Yemen in 2015 to push back the Houthis who had taken over most of the country including the capital Sanaa and to restore the Gulf-backed government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

The war has brought Yemen to the verge of famine sparking what the United Nations has said is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.

“The designation [of the Houthis] would starve millions of Yemenis and he [Biden] knows that” said Iman Saleh general coordinator of the Yemeni Liberation Movement an anti-war advocacy group in the US. “A designation would make him no different from Trump.”

Saleh who went on a hunger strike near the White House last year to demand an end to the Saudi-led coalition’s aid as well as the removal of a sea and air blockade on Yemen also criticised the US administration’s stance of solely blaming the Houthis for prolonging the war. “It’s time for Biden to stop these games and fulfill his campaign promise: end the war in Yemen” she told Al Jazeera.

Democratic pressure

Amid Democratic Party legislators’ fury over Trump’s close ties with Riyadh nearly all of the party’s presidential candidates including Biden promised during the 2020 election campaign to end US support to the Saudi-led coalition.

Last February just weeks into his presidency Biden announced an end to American assistance for Saudi Arabia’s “offensive operations” in Yemen as well as “relevant arms sales”.

But he reaffirmed his commitment to the kingdom’s security and last year Biden’s administration greenlit a $650m sale of air-to-air missiles to Riyadh as well as a $500m helicopter maintenance deal drawing rebuke from some rights activists.

On Thursday Brett McGurk the White House’s National Security Council coordinator for the Middle East appeared to lay the blame for ongoing violence in Yemen squarely on the Houthis.

“There have been a number of ceasefire initiatives on the table; the Houthis have refused to engage” McGurk said during a virtual address at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace a think tank in Washington DC.

The Houthis last year rejected a US-backed Saudi proposal for a ceasefire insisting that lifting the blockade including reopening Sanaa airport is a prerequisite for ending the war.

Hassan El-Tayyab legislative director for Middle East policy at the Friends Committee on National Legislation advocacy group said the US administration’s position ignores “devastating impacts of the Saudi blockade” on Yemen.

El-Tayyab also warned that re-designating the Houthis would make it more difficult to end the conflict.

“While the Houthis share much of the blame alongside the Saudi-led coalition for human rights violations in Yemen a foreign terrorist designation would do nothing to address those concerns” he told Al Jazeera. “It would however prevent the delivery of critical humanitarian assistance to millions of innocent people and greatly hurt the prospects for negotiated settlement.”

‘Will cost lives’

The Houthis are the de-facto authorities in much of northern Yemen where they control local governance and basic state functions. Humanitarian aid groups have said blacklisting the rebels would raise the risk they could incur US sanctions should they provide assistance and much-needed essential commodities to aid-dependent Yemenis living in the area.

“After years of conflict many Yemenis are already living on the brink and they cannot afford to pay even higher prices for food fuel medicine and other necessities” Paul of Oxfam America told Al Jazeera in an email. “Imports would be disrupted and the flow of aid would decrease. The decision to list the Houthis will absolutely cost lives in Yemen.”

Still the UAE and foreign policy hawks in Washington continue to push for a designation.

“Close UAE-US cooperation helped to repel another round of Houthi terror attacks this morning in the UAE” the Emirati ambassador to the US Yousef Al Otaiba said via his embassy’s Twitter account on Monday. “Next step is to shut off financial and arms flows from their backers. US should move now to put the Houthis back on the terrorist list.”

US should move now to put the Houthis back on the terrorist list.” — UAE Embassy US (@UAEEmbassyUS) January 24 2022

Several Republican US senators also introduced a bill to re-designate the Houthis this week with Ted Cruz accusing Biden of appeasing Iran which the Saudi-led coalition accuses of being behind the Houthis – a charge both the Yemeni rebels and Tehran deny.

“US policy in Yemen currently amounts to nothing more than documenting Houthi violence which has escalated since Mr. Biden took office” officials from the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank wrote in the Wall Street Journal on January 25.

“Moreover the administration’s actions have undermined the basis of the American terrorism sanctions regime. Ansar Allah [the Houthi group] is the textbook definition of a terrorist group. If it can have its sanctions lifted without changing its behavior why can’t other terrorist organizations do the same?”

The process

While Congress can pass legislation to compel the president to blacklist a foreign organisation as a “terrorist” group the issue – like most foreign policy matters – is largely under the purview of the executive branch. The US president’s top aides – namely the secretary of state – have the legal authority to designate groups as “terrorists” and to revoke such designation.

Labelling a group as an FTO must meet three standards according to the State Department – the organisation has to be foreign; it must engage in “terrorist” activity as defined by US law and it must pose a threat to Americans or US national security.

Such designations have a profound effect on an organisation’s finances and international relations making it illegal for US citizens to provide “material support or resources” to the blacklisted group including financial assistance and “expert advice or assistance”.

A blacklisting also makes the targeted group’s assets subject to seizure by the US government while opening its members and subsidiaries up to US Treasury Department sanctions.

On Monday State Department Spokesperson Ned Price acknowledged the risks that blacklisting the Houthis poses to the humanitarian situation in Yemen.

Still El-Tayyab said with commercial shippers already reluctant to deal with Yemen Biden’s statement that he is mulling re-designating the Houthis could have adverse humanitarian consequences – even if it does not materialise. “Saying you’re considering [it] really puts a lot of this critical humanitarian aid work in jeopardy” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRyb3dlc3RkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDEvMzAva2F1Zm1hbi1lbGV2YXRlLWNvdW5zZWxpbmctamFpbi1odW50LW1vcnRnYWdlLWdvcmRvbi1hY3Rvbi1mb29kLXBhbnRyeS85MjAwNzkxMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kaufman Elevate Counseling Jain Hunt Mortgage Gordon Acton Food Pantry,"Daily News Staff

Every year up to 3000 people flock to Davos Switzerland each paying $29000 (plus a huge membership fee) to attend the five-day World Economic Forum filled with panels jet planes and parties.

They come to rub shoulders with corporate executives heads of state venture capitalists hedge fund managers and A-list celebrities who together aim to “solve the great crises of the age” writes Peter S. Goodman in his new book “Davos Man: How the Billionaires Devoured the World” (Custom House) out now. It’s “an event where the interests of Bill Clinton Mick Jagger and Greta Thunberg all somehow intersect in time and space.”

Getting into Davos is impossibly complicated even for those lucky enough to score invites. First you must gain membership limited to just 1000 of the world’s biggest corporations which starts at $62000 per year and can run up to $620000 for “strategic partners.” (Government employees non-profits and media outlets get in for free.) The ski resort town has only so many hotel rooms with even bare-bones chalets going for more than $400 a night so some attendees must commute in from neighboring villages where accommodation is limited and going for absurdly inflated prices.

9 it all started in 1971. NY Post/Mike Guillen

As a result “the anxiety of exclusion pervades” journalist Nick Paumgarten once wrote about the scene. “The tension between self-celebration and self-doubt engenders a kind of social electricity.”

Hard to believe it all started in 1971 because Klaus Schwab a 33-year-old German economist and University of Geneva business policy professor wanted to teach US management practices to European firms.

Schwab grew up in Europe’s postwar reconstruction — his family left Germany for Switzerland to escape the Nazis — “steeped in the principles of social democracy” Goodman writes. While studying public administration at Harvard Schwab made friends with mentors like Henry Kissinger and John Kenneth Galbraith and came up with his “stakeholder theory” — the idea that a company should serve not just its shareholders but also its employees suppliers and community.

Schwab wanted a way to discuss these concepts with high-powered contacts on an annual basis so he started the event — originally called the European Management Forum. He chose Davos as its home base because “the remote and placid setting seemed conducive to a focused interchange of ideas.” The mountain village already had a colorful history — it hosted numerous tuberculosis sanatoriums for wealthy Europeans during the 1800s and Albert Einstein was a regular visitor in the early 1920s once giving a lecture on relativity to a summit of visiting academics.

The Forum’s first year attracted 450 people from dozens of countries and within a few years it had established a reputation for exclusivity. Schwab offered a way for CEOs and heads of state to meet and make deals over a few days which “would normally take months to pull off” Goodman told The Post. In 1987 Schwab changed the event’s name to the World Economic Forum and looked for ways to “distinguish itself from the run-of-the-mill business conferences where people sat around talking about money.” So he transformed it into “a demonstration of social concern” Goodman writes.

Today the Forum’s logo plainly spells out its mission: “Committed to Improving the State of the World.” It’s embossed on banners that hang on every street corner and meeting room in Davos during the festivities.

Unlike billionaires of past centuries like Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan who were “by and large satisfied with their wealth as an end in itself” the Davos Man wants more than the spoils of ridiculous affluence. He wants gratitude and validation that he’s doing his part to make the world a better place even if he’s doing nothing of the kind the author claims.

Goodman who’s attended every year as a journalist since 2010 calls the contrast between the Forum’s noble packaging and crude reality “surreal.”

He writes that he’s seen billionaires blindfolded and yelled at by angry officials in group exercises to simulate the Syrian refugee experience — and then afterwards nibble on truffles at dinners hosted by global banks. He has watched venture capitalists fresh out of panel discussions about human trafficking “fist-bumping over having scored invites to the bacchanal thrown by a Russian oligarch who flew in prostitutes from Moscow.”

‘A ludicrous character he displays faith in the veracity of his statements even when they are at odds with reality.’ Peter S. Goodman on Klaus Schwab founder of the World Economic Forum

During the 2020 gathering — the last time the Forum was held in person since the pandemic — the collective net worth of the attendees was $500 billion including President Trump. (The Forum will be returning to Davos again this May.) Today’s attendees — who are predominantly white and male — pose for photos with Matt Damon and congratulate Bill Gates on his philanthropic efforts while attending seminars about how to tackle global warming or economic inequality. They come for “earnest discussions on climate change gender imbalance and the digital future” but they often fail to “live up to their own lofty rhetoric” Goodman writes.

In 2020 Prince Charles gave an address to world leaders and billionaires at Davos urging them to get serious about saving the planet after flying there via private jet. An estimated 1500 individual private planes jetted into Davos for the Forum in 2019 up 11 percent from the previous year according to an analysis by the Air Charter Service. Andy Christie a private jets director for the ACS said in a statement that the increase was due to “business rivals not wanting to be seen to be outdone by one another.”

Marc Benioff the founder of Silicon Valley software giant Salesforce who spoke during a virtual panel at the 2021 Forum has long been one of the biggest proponents of the forum and Schwab in particular whose stakeholder theory he’s called “one of the greatest intellectual contributions to the world of business.”

Benioff perfectly encapsulates the Davos Man aesthetic Goodman writes. He earned his wealth not by privilege but by being “smarter and more innovative than the next guy. He is fine with handing over a little of his money but on his terms alone through branded philanthropic efforts and especially if it puts his name on a hospital wing or yields a photo of himself surrounded by grateful children in some wretched country made slightly less wretched by his generosity.”

During a 2020 interview with Goodman Benioff admitted: “Davos is not perfect but what is the alternative?”

If his focus on doing good was meant only for publicity Benioff argued then his employees would see through it. “They would go elsewhere gravitating toward companies that were genuinely infused with social purpose” Goodman writes.

Meanwhile it’s not just the Forum that’s become overblown over the decades. So has Schwab’s sense of self-importance. Now 83 he expects to be treated like a visiting head of state when he travels complete with “welcoming delegations at the airport” Goodman writes.

Once when a Forum employee inadvertently pulled into Schwab’s parking spot at the Forum’s world headquarters in Switzerland the boss caught wind of the insubordination and despite the fact he was overseas at the time demanded she be fired. He relented “only after senior staff intervened to save her” Goodman writes.

It didn’t help matters when during a Forum gathering in South Africa during the mid-1990s Schwab delivered an address in front of Nelson Mandela in which he borrowed heavily from Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington speech including at one point dramatically declaring “I have a dream.”

“Several of us almost threw up” recalled Barbara Erskine who then ran the Forum’s communications mortified that her boss was trying to pass off MLK’s famous words as his own. (Schwab didn’t respond to requests from The Post for comment.)

9 Schwab’s warm welcome of Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) at Davos in 2017 put a spotlight on the central irony of the Forum Goodman writes. AP

Schwab has often bragged to colleagues that he expected to receive a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Forum Goodman notes. He has yet to receive that honor.

But while he may be “something of a ludicrous character” he also has a special talent for catering to “the narcissistic tendencies of the powerful” Goodman writes. “He displays faith in the veracity of his statements even when they are at odds with reality and the ethos of the Forum.”

9 Schwab has often bragged to colleagues that he expected to receive a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Forum.

This has allowed Schwab to invite keynote speakers like China president Xi Jinping with his reputation for encouraging human trafficking and forced labor and brutally cracking down on dissent.

“In a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility the international community is looking to China to continue its responsive and responsible leadership” Schwab said while introducing the Chinese leader in 2017.

It was a moment that put a spotlight on the central irony of the Forum.

“The founding Davos Man was hosting an event crammed with lectures about transparent governance” Goodman writes. All while “bowing to a Chinese dictator.”"

While the handcuffs we see today are different the idea to use an object to restrain someone has existed since ancient Greek times. The creation of restraints has in fact been spotted in Greek mythology. Other mentions of restraining devices date back to the fourth century B.C. where Carthaginian armies used them to hold prisoners of war. However like other inventions handcuffs also evolved over time and were created out of several materials before they reached the most efficient design.

In 1780 Hiatt Handcuff became the first company to manufacture the cuffs but it wasn’t until 1850 that different styles of handcuffs were formulated. This is because incidents of crime had increased and the need for restraints escalated. At that point in time there were two handcuffs – the ‘Bango handcuffs’ and the ‘flexible handcuffs.’ The Bango handcuffs didn’t allow prisoners any movement whereas the flexible ones allowed prisoners to slightly move and perform necessary movements such as eating and drinking water.

In the late 19th century the ‘Snap’ became the most popular handcuff since it could actually ‘snap’ onto the wrists of the criminals or suspects. Then came the ‘Twister’ which was compact and could easily be carried. The first popular adjustable handcuffs were produced by Tower and were able to provide sustainability and security. These cuffs were created by John J. Tower in 1865 and included a series of handcuffs built under license. Tower applied for his first patent in 1871 to cover the round or oval bow he invented.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1aWxkaW5nLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvY2FuYXJ5LXdoYXJmLXRvd2VyLXJldmFtcC1mb3ItdXMtYmFuay1zZXQtdG8tYmUtb3ZlcmJ1cnlzLWJpZ2dlc3QtZXZlci1kZWFsLzUxMTU4MDUuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canary Wharf tower revamp for US bank set to be Overbury's biggest ever deal,"Scheme to overhaul Citi’s 42-storey block could be worth as much as £400m

Overbury has been lined up for a huge overhaul of Citi’s Canary Wharf headquarters in a deal which could end up being the firm’s biggest ever.

The US investment bank has given the job to overhaul its 42-storey office tower at 25 Canada Square completed in 2001 to a design drawn up by César Pelli & Associates an official value of £100m.

But Building understands the final price could be north of £300m and as much as £400m – making it Overbury’s biggest job in its 56 year history.

Overbury is preferred bidder for the job and is expected to sign a deal later this year ahead of work starting next. Architect on the scheme is Wilkinson Eyre.

Overbury’s parent Morgan Sindall which will release bumper 2021 results next month said fit-out work has boomed during the pandemic with the business having a record order book of £944m at the end of last September – a rise of 130% from the end of 2020.

Citi employs 9000 people in London and its EMEA chief executive David Livingstone said: “Our aim is to create an environmentally sustainable innovative and exciting place to work incorporating modern design state-of-the-art technology and best practices in employee and client spaces.”

The work has been planned ever since Citi bought the tower in 2019 for a reported £1bn but the scheme had been held up by the pandemic. Citi has told staff to come back to the office for three days a week and Livingstone added: “We’re a business of energy and ideas and we thrive on bringing people together.”

All of the bank’s London staff will relocate temporarily to the nearby 33 Canada Square and another building close by until the refurbishment is complete – which has officially been put at 2025.

The news is a further tonic for the finance sector which has seen swathes of Canary Wharf and the City turned into ghost towns by the pandemic with staff being forced to work from home.

Last September ISG won a £100m deal to overhaul the headquarters of Barclays Bank also in Canary Wharf.

Earlier this month new ISG chief executive Matt Blowers told Building turnover for fit-out in London last year was around £600m and that businesses were willing to spend large sums of money on upgrading offices.

“An office is a shop window into a business’s culture” he said. “There is a massive war on talent not just in our sector but across the piece. People are investing significant money on getting their facilities in a great place to retain talent and attract the best.”

As the Biden administration looks to spend billions of dollars to address inequalities in water quality and access officials must try to overcome persistent public distrust of tap water. Experts say it will be especially difficult to overcome in Black and Hispanic communities where suspicion can be entrenched because of past instances of being misled by public officials and high-profile lead crises in cities with large Black populations including Flint and Newark New Jersey.

“Problems in one place erode trust in other places” said David Switzer a water quality and public policy researcher at the University of Missouri.

The issue will hit home in many cities and towns as the Biden administration pushes to replace millions of lead service lines in the U.S. that can leach lead into drinking water. In addition tightened testing standards might reveal higher lead levels and put more communities on notice about problems.

Lead exposure can cause a host of health problems and is considered especially dangerous for young children because it can slow development and cause other troubles.

Already 20% of adults nationally say they don’t drink tap water — filtered or not — up from 14% before the Flint crisis according to a study of federal survey data. The figures are higher among Black adults with 35% saying they avoid drinking tap up from 25% before Flint. Among Hispanic adults the figure rose to 38% up from 27%.

That distrust can translate to unnecessary spending on bottled water or make it more likely that adults reach for sugary drinks that can increase the risk of health problems such as diabetes and cavities said Asher Rosinger a Pennsylvania State University researcher who studies water access.

There’s also the constant stress for parents who worry that tap water might poison their children he said.

Though the vast majority of the country’s water systems report that they meet federal health standards problems such as elevated lead levels and health violations happen more often in lower-income areas that are predominantly Black or Hispanic Switzer said.

Defective plumbing that tinges water brown or creates an odd taste can also turn people away from the faucet. Immigrants from countries with unsafe water might transfer that distrust to water that might be safer in the U.S. and pass that uneasiness on to their children said Silvia R. González who works on environmental equity and water issues at UCLA’s Latino Policy and Politics Initiative.

“Thinking about my family my dad will not drink the tap water and therefore my brother does not drink the tap water” said Gonzalez whose father immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico.

And if residents feel their local government is indifferent to their needs — a problem especially prevalent in Black and brown communities — that can foster distrust in drinking water according to experts.

“There’s a legacy of mistrust and a healthy sense of paranoia that has kept us alive for centuries” said Robert Bullard a professor at Texas Southern University who has researched and pushed for environmental justice for decades.

Philadelphia which is 44% Black is one of the few places that have run a public campaign to help save residents money and reduce plastic pollution by boosting trust in tap water. Murals on buildings and songs promote the city’s drinking water.

Though it hasn’t had a lead scandal city surveys indicate that residents avoid the tap because of health concerns and taste. Among Black residents in 2021 more than 60% said they mostly drank bottled water compared with 42% of Philadelphia’s residents overall.

Monika Davis who is Black switched from bottled water to tap when she applied to become one of roughly a dozen residents enlisted by the city as ambassadors in 2019 to show up at events and talk to her neighbors about the safety and benefits of tap water.

She remembers her family boiling water as a precaution when she was growing up. Touring the water treatment plant and learning about the city’s water quality helped convince her of its safety she said.

The percentage of residents relying on bottled water declined after the campaign but it rose again last year.

“It takes a lot to change a habit” Davis said.

For some the Flint crisis reinforced suspicions that public officials are indifferent to Black and brown communities. Michigan officials had switched the city’s water source to save money and initially downplayed the problem before the facts emerged and it became a major scandal.

“People rightly felt betrayed” said Mark Edwards a water quality specialist at Virginia Tech.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says no amount of lead is considered safe for children. But many water systems have some lead and are required to take significant action when levels reach a federal threshold. Edwards said the CDC guidance might cause needless fear muddling the difference between low levels and amounts that are truly concerning. Flint’s levels are low but not zero.

Stamps cites the federal health goal of no lead to explain her skepticism saying none should be in the water.

It’s why experts say that it won’t be enough to replace lead pipes and that public outreach efforts will be key.

In Flint Michigan officials say lead levels have been lower for years and the state now has the strongest lead water protections in the country. They say they have worked to replace lead lines upgrade infrastructure and be transparent by publishing testing data but they acknowledge that rebuilding trust will take time and continued outreach.

A community lab that isn’t affiliated with the government also tests water for free.

“The residents are still at a point where they are not trusting government” said Candice Mushatt the Flint Community Lab’s director adding that residents value the lab’s independence — it builds trust.

Hire the right experts to develop a first-class plan so the city can get all the funding it needs to repair its crumbling system said Rengao Song a water quality and treatment expert who works as an adviser to the Louisville Kentucky city water system.

“You have to be ready to pull the trigger” he said. “The city can’t just say ‘Well we need this much money to help.’”

He said Jackson has a chance to obtain federal funding from the $1.2 trillion American Rescue Plan Act. President Biden even talked of the capital city’s water woes in pushing the legislation.

Many states have already allocated this funding; Mississippi hasn’t. It has not decided how to spend the $1.8 billion it received.

Of that money $459 million is earmarked for water improvements across Mississippi which is a problem. The city of Jackson is one of many in line and Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has said publicly the city needs $1 billion to fix its water system and $1 billion to fix its sewer system. And the Mississippi Rural Water Association told lawmakers water districts need $1.4 billion in upgrades to their systems across the state.

When MCIR asked for the details on this city officials shared a report that showed replacement for water lines in each city precinct would run between $7.3 million and $11.3 million. Repairing one water treatment plant would run more than $20 million; the other $15.6 million.

The cost of failing to deliver the water may be even greater. More than 40% of the treated water never makes it to customers according to the Mississippi Department of Health.

Faulty sewer lines causing overflows into Pearl River

The city’s report detailed 135 sewer collection system failures affecting 127000 residents and businesses. The price tag for those repairs? $30 million.

Leaks in these aging lines mean not only water leaking out of the pipes but unwanted water going in and causing sewer pipes to overflow.

On Jan. 9 that happened in Lefleur’s Bluff State Park when “a tremendous amount of rain overwhelmed the system” said Chris Lockhart a board member of Pearl Riverkeepers which monitors the river.

That rainwater blew off a manhole cover causing sewage to empty into Eubanks Creek which feeds into the Pearl River. The ground remains covered with toilet paper and waste.

About four months earlier another sewer line erupted flowing into the creek Lockhart said. “When it’s not contained in the pipes like it’s supposed to do it makes its way into somebody’s drinking water somebody’s fishing water somebody’s swimming hole downriver.”

Those leaks are among the many that contaminate the Pearl River. In the first quarter of 2020 about half a billion gallons of raw sewage leaked into the river according to a city report.

Since 2012 the city of Jackson has been under a consent decree from the EPA because of this sewage problem.

“Over the past four years it’s only gotten worse” said Abby Braman executive director for the Pearl Riverkeepers. “It’s extremely frustrating to us.”

The Savannah Street treatment plant puts so much partially treated wastewater into the river “it could fill four NFL stadiums” she said.

Pearl Riverkeepers is now pushing state lawmakers to use American Rescue Plan Act funding to make these repairs.

“You have citizens that literally don’t have clean drinking water and don’t have an operating sewer system” Braman said. “We feel like this is something the state should prioritize.”

Experts say water and sewer pipes should be replaced on a rotating basis each year but that hasn’t happened in Jackson which has been devastated by falling tax revenues. More than 100 miles of pipes are more than a century old.

Eric Rothstein has worked on some of the nation’s biggest drinking water disasters including Flint Michigan. “My specialty is water financing” he said. “Sometimes I feel like the Zelig of utility finance disasters.”

He worked as a consultant for Jackson noting the city is hardly the first to have suffered such a fate “letting systems fall into disrepair. These systems are underground and easily forgotten.”

Water issues represent 'everything that can go wrong'

He said the city of Jackson represents “everything that can go wrong — billing problems metering problems difficulty in retaining qualified personnel.”

Billing problems have been so catastrophic that between 2014 and 2021 the city missed out on more than $83 million in water billing revenue according to city officials.

Officials blamed much of that on metering woes. Last year Jackson received a $90 million settlement from Siemens as a result of faulty meters but that failed to solve the city’s water billing woes.

A third went to lawyers. What happened to the rest is less clear.

A Clarion Ledger analysis concluded that half went to the city’s general fund to the Public Works enterprise fund or to pay down city debt. Another $10 million of the settlement remains earmarked for water meter and billing fixes but city officials say they need another $37 million to pay for all these changes.

In August the city began installing new water meters.

As for its two water plants the city is supposed to have 24 Class A workers running them. That number has fallen to five or six violating the city’s consent decree with the EPA.

City officials say that Class A operators make about $14 an hour despite having college degrees. Those without a degree can become Class A operators with a GED and six years’ experience and also pass the exam according to Mississippi Department of Health standards. In both cases applicants must have at least one year of working experience in a Class A plant.

The Jackson City Council recently boosted these salaries as much as $10000 a year for some hoping to retain these operators whose average salary across the U.S. tops $48000 a year.

Jackson’s water treatment operation continues to struggle. In April an electrical fire caused two service pumps to fail at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant resulting in a temporary loss of water pressure. In November the city issued a boil-water notice after unsafe chemicals were used to treat the drinking water.

The Clarion Ledger reported that two-thirds of all water samples taken in Jackson since 2015 have contained at least a trace amount of lead.

Faucet filters can help clean contaminated water

Song said if lead contamination is a concern faucet filters “are the way to go for customers.” Some of the more expensive filters utilize reverse osmosis to remove contaminants.

For more than 26 years Robert Miller worked for the water system in Louisville Kentucky 17 of them as chief financial officer.

After he retired in 2008 he decided to move to New Orleans to assist in rebuilding their water system following the destruction from Hurricane Katrina. “My job was to rebuild the administrative side” he said. “The city was about six weeks behind in paying their bills. They hardly had any money in the bank.”

While there he said “reforms to business processes improvements to financial planning and program of rate increases helped the water system go from junk bonds to A and A+ rated bonds with more than a quarter-billion dollars in the bank” by the time he left.

After Lumumba took office in 2017 the mayor’s transition team lured Miller to work for the city of Jackson.

Jackson's water woes

“When I met him I became convinced that he was the type of transformational leader that comes along once in a generation” Miller said. “I wanted to become part of his team.”

Miller managed the water and sewage plants through two winter emergencies when the temperature dropped to 13 degrees each time.

Asked what advice he would give the city of Jackson these days he replied “All of the advice I had for Jackson I gave while I was there.”

He retired again in 2020 returning to Kentucky.

“It is disconcerting to read of the struggles that the citizens of Jackson continue to endure as the city works to resolve the problems with billing and collecting for water and sewer service” he said. “However it is important to keep in mind that these fixes take time to implement.”

Rothstein said the American Rescue Plan Act brings hope to Jackson.

“My experience is that Atlanta Detroit and even Flint had leadership pay consistent attention to these issues” he said. “Atlanta faced a huge problem with its consent decree. The mayor there took on the moniker of being the ‘sewer mayor.’ He showed a commitment to the right thing and ultimately gained support.”

Song said the number one priority for water plants is “to make sure the water is safe to drink. That cannot be compromised.”

Unlike items we buy that can be recalled “we can’t recall water” he said. “We can’t tell people ‘Sorry the water you had yesterday is bad.’”

And while that percentage has remained pretty constant population growth has not. Only 1 percent of freshwater is accessible to the 7.7 billion people and counting.

As concerns over water scarcity grow research from 2018 documents how freshwater availability has changed over the years helping water specialists and managers pinpoint how this essential resource’s flows have been changing. Xander Huggins a PhD candidate at the University of Victoria and Global Institute for Water Security at the University of Saskatchewan and his fellow researchers decided to explore what exactly these changes would mean for life here on Earth. Their results were published in Nature this month.

The team examined 1204 basins across the world to understand how water availability couples with social processes to create vulnerability in communities. The main factor they studied were freshwater stress which is the ratio of H 2 O that is used versus the amount that naturally leaves the watershed or basin each year; the higher the stress the less water there is available for ecosystems and for people’s demands according to Huggins. Following this he and his colleagues coupled the findings with data on how freshwater storage in underground aquifers and glaciers for example is changing.

Huggins learned that 42 percent of the 478 most stressed basins around the planet are also the ones disproportionately losing storage. These basins including ones in the American South and Southwest central Argentina and throughout the Middle East are the ones where people and living things are already under pressure. By his team’s calculations around 2.2 billion people and 27 percent of all global food crop production is located within drying-out freshwater basins.

Identifying vulnerable water sources

After mapping the most high-risk areas Huggins created a vulnerability analysis by combining the relationship between stress and storage with data on how prepared and economically sufficient a government might be to respond. He hopes that by creating a framework to understand vulnerability and identifying these “hotspot” basins the water scarcity in these regions can be prioritized by policymakers.

Huggins notes that the metric is simplified enough to use it on a global scale. Out of the 168 “very high” and “high” vulnerability scoring areas not all faced the same threats. The authors of the paper found that the most vulnerable basins predictably had the worst water resource management and that basins that spanned countries were even worse off. According to the scale nations like Algeria India and Kazakhstan were found to have high vulnerabilities according to the scale as well as low levels of water management.

While the US scores highly in terms of social adaptiveness in Huggins’s study it has multitude freshwater issues that go beyond stress and storage. Equitable access to freshwater sources looks different in communities across the states. According to Jill Ryan the executive director of Freshwater Future an advocacy group working on protecting drinking reservoirs in the Great Lakes region two of the biggest issues are that of water contamination and cost. Illinois and Ohio are the states with the highest levels of lead in their pipes. Rising costs are also making water too expensive for a growing number of families––one of the reasons being new infrastructure to get rid of the lead pipes. This cost is now increasingly being pushed onto the consumers Ryan says.

[Related: How to test your tap water for lead]

In addition Ryan picks out weather extremes as a major source of destabilization. The Great Lakes contain about 20 percent of the world’s fresh surface water––a gift from the glaciers as Ryan puts it. “It’s a fluctuating system [of water levels] though” Ryan says. “It’s always been within a maximum and a minimum: You see these 30-year fluctuations but we’re seeing much faster fluctuations now and much more severe. We’re approaching record status on almost a yearly basis in terms of either highs or lows.”

Both Ryan and Huggins note that groundwater wells are facing a growing problem of scarcity. In the US close to one-fifth of all wells are within 16 feet of going dry in response to increased groundwater pumping.

“When wells run dry that can exacerbate economic inequalities because only the wealthiest can afford to dig deeper wells” says Huggins. “That economic inequality can then manifest through water insecurity as rural well-owners might not have the reliable freshwater access that they used to.”

Scarcity in the Southwest

One of the regions highlighted in Huggins’s work is the southwestern US. Like the Great Lakes the Colorado River and Rio Grande River basins are home to various communities across the surrounding states. The Colorado basin supports a number of protected areas of flora and fauna sacred cultural sites for Indigenous people and a trillion-dollar economy for nearly 40 million people says Michael Fiebig director of the Southwest River Protection program for American Rivers. But predictions for the basin look dire: One estimate from the Colorado Water Center shows that by 2050 there will be 20 to 30 percent less water in the basin due to various climate change scenarios.

Overallocation and human-induced climate change are the two biggest reasons for this pending crisis says Fiebig. “Essentially there’s more water that’s been divided out to people through treaties and settlements than there is water provided in the watershed.” This is what he calls the difference between “paper water” and “wet water.”

As temperatures rise soil moisture also dwindles. Less drainage occurs through runoff and the snowpack grows smaller. All in all there’s less water in both the rivers and the ground.

[Related: Are ‘water positive’ pledges from tech companies just a new kind of greenwashing?]

Water experts are working on a bevy of solutions to counter these many issues. For instance a lot of Ryan and Fiebig’s work in their respective regions is about resilience which is a measure of how much stress a river system can handle without collapsing. In the Colorado basin’s case that factors in incredible heat drought and pollution.

“We’re having trouble stabilizing the system right now and living within our means in 2022. By 2050 we’ll look back at 2022 like the good old days” says Fiebig. “‘These were the days of plenty’––but it doesn’t feel like the days of plenty right now.”

Correction (January 31 2022): The story previously said that the new Nature research studied 1024 water basins. The correct number was 1204. It has also been updated to include a clearer definition of freshwater stress and a direct link to the study in focus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcGxhbi10by1zZW5kLXNhbi1sdWlzLXZhbGxleS13YXRlci10by1kb3VnbGFzLWNvdW50eS1oaXRzLW9wcG9zaXRpb24vYXJ0aWNsZV8yMzdmOGQ1ZS03YWY0LTExZWMtYjFmNi0xNzExMjQ0MTNhMGYuaHRtbNIBmQFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcGxhbi10by1zZW5kLXNhbi1sdWlzLXZhbGxleS13YXRlci10by1kb3VnbGFzLWNvdW50eS1oaXRzLW9wcG9zaXRpb24vYXJ0aWNsZV8yMzdmOGQ1ZS03YWY0LTExZWMtYjFmNi0xNzExMjQ0MTNhMGYuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plan to send San Luis Valley water to Douglas County hits opposition,"Farmers ranchers and water managers in the San Luis Valley are gearing up for the fourth legal fight in as many decades to keep their water in its aquifer and this time away from thirsty Douglas County.

In recent weeks they’ve gained a powerful ally: Attorney General Phil Weiser who is threatening to go to court if that becomes necessary.

The project by Renewable Water Resources a water developer proposes to tap 25 new groundwater wells in a “confined” aquifer in the valley. That would bring 22000 acre feet of water to the South Platte River and eventually to a yet-to-be unidentified water provider in Douglas County.

The Renewable Water Resources proposal which has been underway since 2017 claims a billion acre-feet of water exists in the larger of two San Luis Valley aquifers a figure disputed by San Luis Valley water experts. One acre-foot is equivalent to 326000 gallons or enough water to cover an acre of land about the size of a football field one foot deep. A confined aquifer is an aquifer that is saturated with water. When drilled water rises to the top. An unconfined aquifer is what is more commonly referred to as a water table — it rises and falls based on barometric pressure.

Renewable Water Resources’ project wants to tap the confined aquifer which is larger both by geographic footprint and by water volume. The company argued the project is needed to ensure water reliability for Douglas County and maintained that the plan is sustainable — both for residents of the county and the valley.

Under the proposal the wells would be situated on land either owned or controlled by RWR which currently owns approximately 9800 acres and has options to acquire approximately 8000 additional acres.

The 22000 acre-feet of water represents 2.5% of the aquifer’s annual recharge defined as water pumped back into the aquifer through precipitation and a volume that RWR claims would not affect diminish the base.

The proposal noted that Colorado's water law mandates that in order to develop water it must be ""retired at the same rate"" a doctrine informally known as the ""one-for-one"" law in the water community. That means every drop of water removed must be replaced by the same amount.

As it turns out Division 3 Water Court in in Alamosa where RWR plans to submit its proposal is the only water court that uses that law.

""Recognizing there is a shallow section of the aquifer the RWR project aims to accomplish 'one-for-one plus"" the proposal says adding the Colorado Water Court also requires the provision known as ""no harm no injury"" to the environment people and property.

RWR claims its proposal will meet Water Court criteria and that it is prepared to enter it in Division 3.

Under the plan Douglas County would kick in $20 million from American Rescue Plan federal money which is already raising questions about whether that’s a legitimate use of the federal relief funds and whether years of legal battles would run out the clock for using those dollars which under federal guidelines must be spent by December 2024.

On Jan. 18 Douglas County commissioners heard very different perspectives on whether the water is actually there.

Bruce Lytle of Lytle Water Resources who is working with RWR told commissioners the aquifer has the water needed for the project. That's in stark contrast to what they heard from State Deputy Engineer Mike Sullivan who told the commissioners the aquifer's water is over-appropriated meaning there's nothing left for Douglas County.

On top of that according to the Alamosa Citizen the Rio Grande Water Conservation District was told recently the aquifer reached its lowest point since 2013 and is not sufficiently recharging. That recharge is key to to RWR's proposal.

The Rio Grande River Basin and the San Luis Valley have for years been fighting the battle against drought largely caused by declining rainfall and warmer temperatures which makes the snowpack melt sooner. Water Education Colorado reported in 2020 that growers of the valley's signature crop — potatoes — are trying to wean themselves off groundwater in order to restore stream flows in the Rio Grande which is tied to a compact between Colorado New Mexico and Texas.

It's a fight replicated across many communities in the American Southwest which is grappling with drying rivers and dwindling water supplies amidst a decades-long drought that has forced states to aggressively adopt conservation measures.

The commissioners

Whether the proposal goes forward with Douglas County money hinges on the county's commissioners and they're not all on the same page.

Douglas County Commissioner George Teal wrote in a Douglas County News-Press op-ed on Jan. 4 that he finds the RWR proposal “intriguing"" and he appeared willing to listen to RWR's pitch.

""I am interested in a robust fact-based conversation about our water future to include innovation conservation and out-of-the-box thinking"" he wrote. ""I will listen to any idea that offers a path forward while protecting our Western way of life and fulfilling our commitment to our families and community while also supporting our job-creating economy.""

In 2020 and 2021 Teal took in thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from five of the eight RWR principals. Notably on Aug. 13 his TRACER account showed nine new contributions totaling $16000 and five came from RWR principals: Hugh Bernardi the manager of RWR gave the maximum $2500. So did John Kim and Sean Tonner. Tonner's wife Laura donated $1000 James Yates gave $500 and Bryan Wright contributed $1000.

He also received contributions from the owners of Sterling Ranch a housing development west of Colorado Highway 85 that Teal said could be one of several potential end-users.

Teal said he and Tonner have been been friends since 2004 and he called Tonner on Aug. 13 the same day he received contributions from the RWR principals.

He was trying to retire campaign debt and RWR's principals came through as did several other big-dollar donors he said. Those contributions will also help him as he plans to run for reelection in 2024 when he faces a rematch with a Democratic opponent who he said receives a lot of out-of-state contributions.

Sean Duffy a spokesman for RWR confirmed the contributions but downplayed their significance.

""There was no significance to the date — just when the donations were received"" he said. ""For what it's worth many of the RWR team including the principals particularly are Douglas County residents and most have been actively involved in county politics for 15 years or more including Tonner hosting a 2020 event for [Commissioner] Lora Thomas at his home. So political involvement isn't a new endeavor.""

Thomas whose district includes Sterling Ranch is adamantly opposed citing a host of reasons including her ethical objections.

In a Jan. 11 op-ed in the Douglas County News-Press Thomas wrote that the $68 million in federal money awarded to Douglas County if spent appropriately can improve lives and change the face of the county.

“If misspent we will squander a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" she said adding the proposal fails to identify how the water will get to the county.

She also noted the county already has received requests for water projects totaling $300 million.

“There is no available water to export to Douglas County or anywhere else” Thomas said citing current conditions in the valley. ""All valley water is earmarked. Any new uses must shortchange irrigated agriculture to make that water available. The claim in RWR’s proposal that there is unused water in the valley are flatly contradicted by numerous court rulings and the very need for the state engineer to issue rules strictly governing water use.”

Taking water from the valley would dry up tens of thousands of acres of productive agriculture she said.

She also claimed ARPA guidelines “preclude buying water rights and obtaining water for future population needs. Moreover I believe it is morally and ethically wrong to take water from the valley under the circumstances.”

Thomas is now being targeted by robocalls emails and a survey that asks Douglas County residents if they support her position. RWR denied it is responsible for those communications.

So the project's fate might come down to Commissioner Abe Laydon who said in a Jan. 3 commissioner work session that he has an open mind about the project. But Laydon a Latino whose family goes back five generations in the valley reportedly expressed hesitation about doing anything that would hurt the San Luis Valley.

The county is expected to make its final decision on the project by the end of March.

Where is the water going?

Duffy said last month that RWR has not yet determined a water provider who would buy the San Luis Valley-sourced water for customers. He said this month it's ""premature"" to identify an end user.

Colorado Politics asked most of the 47 water districts including the dozen largest ones whether they intend to participate in the project either as the end user or in the case of Denver allow the reservoirs the county manages to hold that water.

The answer was “no"" from all but one potential end-user. Denver Water which manages the reservoirs also shot down the idea.

Jim Lochhead manager of Denver Water told Colorado Politics in an email that “Denver Water has not been contacted by Renewable Water Resources concerning any purchase of water or use of our facilities for the delivery of water. Moreover Denver Water has no interest in purchasing or using water imported to the South Platte River Basin as proposed by RWR nor any interest in any arrangement to use our reservoirs to facilitate the storage or delivery of this water to anyone else.”

Denver Water manages three of the four reservoirs identified in the RWR proposal as potential storage sites: Antero and Elevenmile both in Park County and Strontia Springs in Douglas and Jefferson counties. The fourth reservoir identified in the RWR proposal Chatfield is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers but it isn’t likely a storage destination either as it is solely used for the purpose of storing water belonging to Denver Water.

Greg Baker a spokesman for Aurora water answered similarly: RWR has not engaged in discussions with Aurora Water regarding storage or conveyance and does not plan to participate in the RWR acquisition. Aurora provides water to some of the northern county water districts.

Sterling Ranch is a 20-year housing project south of Titan Road and west of Colorado Highway 85. It began construction in 2016 with a proposed buildout for 33000 residents and about 12000 homes. So far about 1000 homes have been built.

That Dominion and Sterling Ranch could be the end users — both entities vigorously deny any interest in San Luis Valley water and maintain their supply is sufficient to meet needs — is bolstered by RWR’s proposal which says the project “will maximize use of existing infrastructures ultimately supporting the county’s goals of enhancing solutions along the I-85 corridor.”

That's a reference to Colorado Highway 85 which comes into the county from the north and then merges with I-25 at Castle Rock.

On Jan. 17 Zillow.com showed 58 new-construction homes currently available for sale at Sterling Ranch.

Dominion in an unsigned Jan. 3 email said it “had not been formally approached by RWR as a partner"" on the San Luis Valley Water project.

""Our current water supply portfolio is sufficient to meet existing demands of our retail customers” the water provider said.

In a Jan. 25 letter to Colorado Politics Dominion said the projects it is advancing ""do not include purchasing water from the San Luis Valley nor participating in the RWR proposal."" The water provider also said its existing water supply portfolio is ""sufficient to meet and assure water is available at full build-out of Sterling Ranch as well as the existing residences included within the Chatfield Valley Framework.""

The water provider added: ""Dominion will meet the needs of our customers by using our existing water supply portfolio to the fullest extent – achieving our commitment to provide 70% renewable water supplies to our customers. We will do this in a responsible and thoughtful manner by leveraging the demand management techniques and water efficiency standards that have proven to reduce water usage by our existing customers. We will continue to champion collaborative solutions for Northwest Douglas County by continuing to provide our customers with a locally controlled resilient water supply that is environmentally responsible and economically feasible.""

The president of Sterling Ranch is Brock Smethills whose father Harold was president when the project started. Collectively the Smethills including Harold’s wife Diane have poured more than $12000 into Teal’s campaign account mostly in 2020 and 2021. They’ve also been generous with Thomas with $7700 in contributions although none came since 2020.

Both Brock and Harold Smethills are directors on the Dominion Water & Sanitation District board.

The Sterling Ranch website section on water sustainability contains this quote from Harold Smethills: “Water is such an important necessity of human life … There is plenty of water in the state though it’s in the wrong places and we have to move it.”

Teal said it could be Sterling Ranch Castle Rock or Parker Water. Regarding Castle Rock Teal explained that the town provides water to customers outside of its boundaries part of an I-85 partnership between Castle Rock and Dominion.

The Smethills in a Jan. 24 letter to Colorado Politics disputed the story saying any depiction of Sterling Ranch as a recipient of water from the RWR project or that it is short on water is factually inaccurate.

In particular the Smethills said ""Sterling Ranch has no plans to be served by the San Luis water. That water is not required or needed [for] the buildout of Sterling Ranch.""

""When our family planned Sterling Ranch we committed to create a reliable renewable conjunctive use water system and that has been accomplished"" the Smethills said. ""Tens of millions of dollars was invested to create that system and it is now serving Sterling Ranch and has all the water it needs to provide water at build out. It is now building the infrastructure as it is needed.""

Castle Rock Water spokeswoman Mary Jo Woodrick said in an email that ""at this time we do not intend to acquire water from RWR’s San Luis Valley project.""

Woodrick added: ""Our financial resources are already committed to a number of big projects that are part of our long term renewable water plan a plan that has been in progress since at least 2013.""

She said that includes completing the construction of a new reservoir; tapping into the Aurora WISE project which supplies water to a number of Douglas County water districts; and constructing a new pipeline to the county's Rueter-Hess reservoir which is on the county's east side.

The town's strategic plan which was updated in 2019 however also calls for the purchase of 700 acre-feet of water through ""renewable water rights.""

Teal said he found it ""amusing"" that Castle Rock said it had no plans to participate.

""I'm sure that's the answer right now"" he said. ""Is Douglas County secure in its water today? Yes. I don't know if anybody is laying awake today wondering if the taps will turn on ... Our water is secure today. [But] it's like filling up your car with gas and driving around thinking you'll never have to fill it up again.""

The American Rescue Plan Act

The American Rescue Plan allocated tens of millions of dollars to county and state governments and Douglas County's share is $68 million. Interim guidelines from the Treasury Department allow for investments in water sewer and broadband infrastructure.

But does that include paying a private company to build a pipeline? Douglas Commissioner Thomas says no.

The National League of Cities published guidance on the types of water projects that would fit under ARPA. Citing an interim final rule from the Treasury eligible uses include “a broad range of projects that improve access to clean drinking water improve wastewater and stormwater infrastructure systems.”

The interim final rule the national group said is intended to align “types of eligible projects with the wide range of projects that can be supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.” The latter can be used for building or upgrading facilities and transmission distribution and storage systems; supporting the consolidation or establishment of drinking water systems; and replacing lead service lines.

A review of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund guidebook however declares ineligible for funding “for-profit non-community water systems.”

Much is to be decided.

Teal said the county is seeking an opinion on the legality of using ARPA funds. He noted the guidance does not appear to allow for the acquisition of new water rights which is at the heart of the RWR project. But there could be some wiggle room for consideration of well infrastructure for example he said.

Another issue is ownership he explained. That question pertains to just how much Douglas County would have to invest in the project and whether $20 million would be a large enough stake to allow for using ARPA dollars.

Should it be determined that the county cannot use ARPA money and the county is unwilling or unable to use its own funds another one option is to forego the county's share of the cost Teal said. That's assuming RWR agrees to it ponies up all of the money but is willing to share ownership rights to Douglas County which Teal called something akin to profit-sharing.

The state engineer

Among RWR’s claims in its proposal is that State Engineer Kevin Rein “recently urged Denver Metro water providers including those located in Douglas County to seek renewable sources of water other than the Denver Aquifer.""

""This new guidance"" RWR said ""will limit the use of the Denver Aquifer and essentially maintain the aquifer as a ‘preserve.’ In other words the aquifer will serve as a back-up option for when Douglas County needs water at times of extreme drought but NOT the main source. For Douglas County this ruling is an imminent and practical challenge and catalyst for necessary change.”

That comes as news to Rein. He told Colorado Politics there have been no new rulings that apply to what RWR describes.

“We are a regulatory agency but we have made no ruling relevant to what the report describes” Rein said in an email.

The advice to limit the use of the Denver aquifer he pointed out came out in 1996 although a memo in 2020 provided guidance to the staff of the engineer’s office that is “a recitation” of the 1996 memo.

“I can’t explain why the report refers to it as new guidance” Rein said. “Nothing that the state engineer has done has made the challenge any more ‘imminent.'”

Show me the money

The project’s total cost is estimated at $600 million. RWR has so far raised just $5.7 million of the total $28.5 million through sales of unregistered securities according to filings with the Security and Exchange Commission. That’s based on filings from 2019 that have not been updated since then.

Tonner told Water Education Colorado in 2019 that the rest of the money will come once the company has signed a deal with an end user in Douglas County.

Tonner said the end user would need to sell enough bonds to pay the farmers RWR and the cost of the massive well fields pipeline and delivery system that will be needed to bring the water up Highway 285 and across to the Front Range.

RWR has promised valley residents $50 million for economic development which the company claims is far more than farmers and ranchers would ever get from agriculture. That “community fund"" would assist local communities with schools broadband or food banks senior services or job training the company said adding a separate pool of money about $68 million would pay farmers and ranchers who agree to sell their water rights known in agriculture circles as ""buy and dry.""

The attorney general

In the valley the RWR project is opposed by water conservation districts city and county leaders as well as various non-profit organizations.

However RWR claims in its proposal that it is acquiring water rights through willing buyers and that once someone learns about the project's benefits for the valley support grows to 42%. The proposal didn't say where the floor for that support started.

This month Attorney General Phil Weiser joined in the chorus of opposition to the project and along with state Sen. Cleave Simpson R-Alamosa who manages the Rio Grande Water Conservation District penned an op-ed for the Alamosa Valley Courier.

“There is a right way and a wrong way to manage our water” the two wrote in the op-ed which was published Jan. 7. “Piping water from the San Luis Valley to the Front Range is the wrong way.”

They wrote that the RWR plan buys up water rights intended for irrigation and comes at a time when the valley is “desperately working to manage a depleted aquifer and protect this community’s future.”

A 2019 Water Education Colorado article said the aquifer is so depleted “that the state has ordered the valley to bring water levels back up to where they were prior to 2000 or face a massive shut down of farm wells in 2030.”

Simpson in that same article said the basin is over-appropriated.

“There are way more decrees for water rights than can be delivered in any one year. We have water rights that haven’t been able to draw from the river in 20 years. Likewise the groundwater system is also over-appropriated” said the fourth-generation San Luis Valley rancher and farmer.

In addition Weiser and Simpson wrote the proposal will not comply with rules from the State Engineer or the state Supreme Court. The RWR proposal seeks to change the rules which would undermine Colorado's compliance with the Rio Grande compact they said.

“No solution to solve these needs should be done at the expense of our agricultural communities” they wrote.

Weiser in an interview last week with Colorado Politics is prepared to put his money or rather the state’s where his mouth is and that includes going to court if necessary.

Weiser explained his office is statutorily mandated to represent a number of agencies relevant to the water issue including the state engineer. But he has a second hat as the people’s lawyer which means he is in a position to be an advocate adding that from that perspective “we need to protect the water of the San Luis Valley.”

He hasn’t landed on any particular legal strategy yet but noted that previous attorneys general have been willing to be active litigants or amici (friend of the court) in cases where the public interest is at stake.

“I won’t be merely reacting on behalf” of whatever agencies his office works with Weiser said. “I’m going to take a lead role in how we in Colorado can stop this from happening because the idea of removing water from the valley at a time of a depleted aquifer is something I can’t understand.”

One critical issue however is that water is a private property right and anyone can sell their water rights independent of the land itself. Weiser said his office will work on how to honor water as a property right as well as recognize the broader public consequences of potential decisions that to him can have harmful effects on other water users.

“My advice to everybody in the Colorado water community is if we can find ways to work together and reach mutually agreeable sound solutions we're all going to be better off” Weiser said. “Once you start an injury into long-term testing your rights and litigation it is a lengthy expensive and uncertain proposition.”

According to the Water Education story backers of the RWR project would have to prove it wouldn’t harm other water users or the aquifer and demonstrate it would not affect the groundwater that maintains the Great Sand Dunes National Park.

Simpson told Colorado Politics last month that the Rio Grande Water Conservation District has been stockpiling funds from previous settlements in preparation for the day when they’re back in court.

Previous attempts

RWR isn't the first entity to try and ferry water out of San Luis Valley.

On the last day of 1987 American Water Development Inc. filed a proposal in Division 3 Water Court to pump 200000 acre-feet of water per year out of the valley with Denver as a potential end user. AWDI based its proposal on a claim that the water isn’t non-tributary — meaning it isn’t groundwater connected to a surface stream. The court believing otherwise shot the proposal down in 1991.

That led to another attempt a few years later that involved Yale University; Gary Boyce a rancher near Crestone and Farallon Capital which at the time was owned by California billionaire Tom Steyer who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2020. Boyce according to the Nature Conservancy bought the land from AWDI and turned it into Baca Ranch with ideas of his own on water exports.

According to a 2013 Washington Free Beacon story “Farallon’s Vaca Partners a joint venture between Yale and the hedge fund bought Boyce’s Baca Ranch for about $16 million in the mid-1990s” with plans to sell the water to Denver. The proponents tried to put two ballot measures on the state ballot in 1998 that would clear the way for their plan but the public rejected those measures with 96% and 97% voting against.

After the failure of the ballot measures in 1999 Farallon sold the 97000-acre ranch to Congress in a deal brokered by The Nature Conservancy for $32 million. That acquisition quadrupled the size of the Great Sand Dunes which became a national park in 2004.

Other solutions

There is at least one other alternative to the Douglas County's efforts to secure more water which comes from the Platte Valley Water Partnership. It’s a collaboration between the Lower South Platte Water Conservancy District based in Sterling and the Parker Water and Sanitation District.

The partnership’s website says Parker’s current water resources are sufficient to meet current demands but ""with a population that’s projected to double and with the Denver Basin groundwater supplies diminishing over time Parker’s ultimate goal is to diversify its water resources portfolio to be comprised of at least 75% renewable water."" (Renewable water is water that can be used with the remainder returned to its source and then reused over and over again to extinction.)

The plan is to build more storage along the South Platte to capture some of the water heading out of the state — and into Nebraska — that exceeds the requirements of the compact between Colorado and Nebraska.

The partnership plans to build a 4000 acre-foot reservoir near partnership-owned land in Logan County as well as store water in Prewitt Reservoir in Merino northeast of Fort Morgan. Future plans include a 72000 acre-foot reservoir in Fremont Buttes in-between Brush and Akron. The total cost? About $800 million.

According to an op-ed by Sarah Parmer director of conservation for Colorado Open Lands the partnership “would utilize high water events on the South Platte River and divert that excess water into reservoirs that can then be used by both cities and farmers and ranchers” with an additional agreement to avoid “buy and dry” on agricultural land.

“The citizens of Douglas County can choose to invest in a water future that cripples a rural community or they can join Parker in leading the Front Range in a new direction — one that reflects the spirit of the Water Plan Parmer wrote. ""The best investment for Douglas County and for Colorado is in a cooperative water-sharing partnership that respects the economy culture and wildlife of two basins while getting Douglas County the water it needs to support its growth” Parmer wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9rb21idWNoYS1jdWx0dXJlcy1jb3VsZC1tYWtlLWJldHRlci13YXRlci1maWx0ZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kombucha Cultures Could Be the Key to Better Water Filters,"The refreshing kombucha tea that's all the rage these days among certain global demographics might also hold the key to affordable environmentally sustainable living membranes for water filtration according to a recent paper published in the American Chemical Society journal ACS ES&T Water. Experiments by researchers at Montana Technological University (MTU) and Arizona State University (ASU) showed that membranes grown from kombucha cultures were better at preventing the formation of biofilms—a significant challenge in water filtration—than current commercial membranes.

As we've reported previously you need three basic ingredients to make kombucha. Just combine tea and sugar with a kombucha culture known as a SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast). The culture is also known as the ""mother"" tea mushroom tea fungus or Manchurian mushroom. (Kombucha tea is believed to have originated in Manchuria China or possibly Russia.)

Whatever you call it it's basically akin to a sourdough starter. A SCOBY is a firm gel-like collection of cellulose fiber (biofilm) thanks to the active bacteria in the culture creating the perfect breeding ground for yeast and bacteria. Dissolve the sugar in non-chlorinated boiling water then steep some tea leaves of your choice in the hot sugar water before discarding them.

Once the tea cools add the SCOBY and pour the whole thing into a sterilized beaker or jar. Then cover the beaker or jar with a paper towel or cheesecloth to keep out insects let it sit for two to three weeks and voilà! You have your own home-brewed kombucha. A new ""daughter"" SCOBY will be floating right at the top of the liquid (technically known in this form as a pellicle).

Beyond its popularity as a beverage kombucha holds promise as a useful biomaterial. For instance scientists at MIT and Imperial College London last year created new kinds of tough ""living materials"" out of SCOBYs that could one day be used as biosensors. These materials could help purify water or detect damage to ""smart"" packing materials. The scientists couldn't use the wild yeasts typically used in kombucha because the yeasts are difficult to modify genetically. Instead the researchers used lab-grown yeast specifically a strain called Saccharomyces cerevisiae or brewer's yeast. They combined the brewer's yeast with a bacteria called Komagataeibacter rhaeticus (which can create a lot of cellulose) to create their ""mother"" SCOBY.

That team was able to engineer the cells in the yeast to produce glow-in-the-dark enzymes that could sense pollutants and then break them down after detection. One of their prototype materials senses the pollutant estradiol while another can detect luciferase a bioluminescent protein. Any number of other strains can be swapped out to achieve different functional properties.

And now we have the possibility of SCOBY-based water filters. According to the authors of this latest paper contaminated drinking water has been linked to 2000 deaths of children globally each day. Commercial polymer-based filters are compact and versatile and they can strain off many dangerous contaminants including bacteria parasites and even some viruses. However the pores of these filters eventually become clogged decreasing the rate of filtration and water flow thanks to the accumulation of clays oils minerals and bacterial biofilms. The latter are especially persistent and difficult to remove once they form. Scientists are developing materials methods and chemical treatments to combat the adhesion of biofilms to the filters. But perhaps a more promising strategy would be to focus instead on developing materials that inhibit bacterial growth. That's where the kombucha SCOBYs come in."

On Monday Ceremorphic of San Jose California formally debuted chip efforts that have been kept in a stealth mode for two years discussing a chip the company claims will revolutionize the efficiency of AI computing in terms of power consumption.

""It's counterintuitive today but higher performance is lower power said Venkat Mattela founder and CEO of the company in an interview with ZDNet via Zoom.

Mattela believes that numerous patents on low-power operation will enable his company's chip to produce the same accuracy on signature tasks of machine learning with much less computing effort.

""What I'm trying to do is not just building a semiconductor chip but also the math and the algorithms to reduce the workload"" he said. ""If a workload takes a hundred operations I want to bring it down to fifty operations and if fifty operations cost less energy than a hundred I want to say mine is a higher-performance system.""

""I have a lot of patience [...] I don't do incremental things"" says founder and CEO Venkat Mattela of his approach to engineering and business. He sold his last company Redpine Signals to Silicon Labs in 2020 for $314 million. Ceremorphic 2022

Mattela is wading into a heavily contested market one where startups such as Cerebras Systems Graphcore and SambaNova have received vast sums of money and where for all their achievements they still struggle to topple the industry heavyweight Nvidia.

Mattela is inclined to take the long view. His last startup Redpine Signals was built over a period of fourteen years starting in 2006. That company was sold to chipmaker Silicon Labs in March of 2020 for $314 million for its low-power Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip technology. (The chip is now being used in the recently introduced Garmin Fenix 7 smartwatch.)

Also: Meta says it will soon have the world's fastest AI supercomputer

The lesson of that seventeen-year effort at Redpine and now at Ceremorphic is twofold: ""I have a lot of patience"" he observed of himself with a chuckle. And ""I don't do incremental things.""

Mattela contends that when he takes on a problem in an area of chip design it is in such a way as to get meaningfully ahead of state of the art. The Redpine wireless chip technology Silicon Labs bought he said went up against the offerings of giant companies Qualcomm and Broadcom in Bluetooth and Wi-FI.

""I took a big challenge I went against them but only with one metric ultra-low-energy wireless twenty-six times less energy than the best in the industry"" said Mattela.

Now Mattela believes he has a similarly winning focus on power along with three other qualities he deems both unique in the AI chip market and essential to the discipline: reliability quantum-safe security and an ability to function in multiple markets.

To make all that possible Mattela held onto the microprocessor assets that had been developed at Redpine to form the foundation of Ceremorphic and retained eighteen employees from that effort whom he has complemented by hiring another 131 people. The company has offices in both San Jose the official HQ and a gleaming new office building in Hyderabad India.

Mattela has an intriguing list of 26 U.S. patents with his name on them and an equally intriguing list of 14 U.S. patent applications from the last few years.

What Mattela dubs a ""Hierarchical Learning Processor"" or HLP consists of a computing element for machine learning running at 2-gigahertz; a custom floating-point unit at the same clock frequency; a custom-designed multi-threading workload scheduling approach; and specially-designed 16-lane PCIe gen-6 circuitry to connect the processor to a system's host processor such as an x86 chip.

The last of these the PCIe part could almost be its own company claims Mattela.

""Right now what is in production is PCIe-4 the dominant one and PCIe-5 just started last year"" explained MattelA. ""And with us PCIe-6 will be in production in 2024 -- I own that technology.""

""That's $12 million if you had to license that"" he said of PCIe-6. ""That alone is a significant thing to design."" The PCIe link will allow Mattela to further refine the energy consumption of a total system he said.

Ceremorphic 2022

At the heart of the chip's advantage are analog circuits resting underneath digital. Some companies have used analog circuits extensively for AI processing the most well-known being startup Mythic which in 2020 revealed a chip that can multiply vectors and matrices -- the heart of machine learning -- not as digital multiplications but as combinations of continuous energy waveforms in accordance with Ohm's Law what the company calls analog computing.

The Ceremorphic HLP chip will use analog computing more selectively than Mythic Mattela told ZDNet.

""At the lowest level of the hierarchy"" of chip functionality ""I do analog computation"" explained Mattela. ""But higher level I don't do analog because I want to make the programming model easy.""

That means ""twenty-three patterns"" for multiply-accumulate in analog via the HLP's micro-architecture. The analog multiplications will be a more efficient use of voltage than digital he argued.

""At a higher level it looks like a vector processing and data-path processing combination.""

The various chip features will contribute to making possible the four qualities Mattela promotes.

Also: 'We are the best-funded AI startup' says SambaNova co-founder Olukotun following SoftBank Intel infusion

In addition to power-efficient operation there is reliability. AI silicon has a reliability problem today claimed Mattela.

Machine learning chips have gotten vastly larger than conventional microprocessors. Nvidia's ""A100"" GPU is already a fairly hefty by classic standards 826 square millimeters. But novel chips from startups can be much larger such as Cerebras's WSE-2 chip measuring 45225 square millimeters almost the entire surface of an eight-inch silicon wafer.

""When you have more silicon there is a greater possibility of failure because there are alpha particles neutron bombardment"" observed Mattela. ""In the last two years people are already saying my systems are failing in the data center.""

Mattela claims a unique hardware-software combination will enable his chip to ""predict faults and correct them.""

""Reliable performance computing engineering is our key contribution"" he said.

The third quality Mattela is emphasizing is security including protection against future quantum systems that could conceivably break conventional data security.

""So far security systems have been designed to counter hacking by humans"" explains Mattela. ""But going forward you can't assume computing power will be limited and that it will take two days to break it [a system] you had better assume perhaps two minutes!""

The Ceremorphic chip has ""quantum-resistant random-number generation"" said Mattela which ""cannot be broken by a very high-performance computer."" In practical terms said Mattela that means such a system would take perhaps a month to break affording a customer time to change the security key to foil the attack.

The fourth property is what Mattela refers to as scaling. What Mattela means by that is addressing multiple markets with one chip. The chip will be able to function in deep learning automotive applications robotics life sciences and some sort of future Metaverse application.

The same HLP will serve to do both training and inference the two aspects of machine learning.

Scaling to multiple markets claimed Mattela will make his chip more relevant than those of competitors. He argues that startups such as Cerebras are impressive but not ultimately as relevant.

""It's very fine engineering yes and you can always do something that nobody else can do but your purpose is not to do something which nobody does"" said Mattela.

""Your purpose is to create an outcome that everybody makes money and it has impact it has some value to the market.""

Of course Cerebras and the others are shipping products while Mattela hasn't even produced samples yet.

To make Ceremorphic's design a winner Mattela has what would appear to be an ace in his pocket: Taiwan Semi's 5-nanometer chip process which is one of the manufacturing giant's ""advanced technologies"" a chip process to which not every customer is given access.

""When I say to people that I am doing 5-nanometer they say How could you get 5-nanometer"" said Mattela with evident delight. ""Some of these companies with hundreds of millions in funding are not in 5-nm; they are in 7-nm.""

One reason is a close relationship Mattela cultivated with TSM years ago when he was at analog chip giant Analog Devices. More important his sale of Redpine to Silicon Labs boosted his credibility. TSM he says had to believe that he can see his product through to fruition for only then does TSM get paid in full.

""It takes many many years"" said Mattela referring to the production process. ""I have to spend $200 million I have to produce a chip the chip has to work and then if it works they [TSM] will get paid at that time.""

Mattela's team designed the chip as a prototype initially in what's called a shuttle run a small batch of chips in the slightly less-sophisticated 7-nanometer process. The company will this year expand its shuttle run batches to 5-nanometer.

While Ceremorphic expects to provide first customer samples of its chip next year full-scale production in 5-nanometer will probably not occur until 2024 he says. ""These are very aggressive dates"" for design in a leading-edge process such as 5-nano Mattela observed of the timeline.

A gating factor is a cost. He points out that to move from shuttle run to full use of a wafer -- what's known as full mask -- is the difference between $2 million and over $10 million.

For that Ceremorphic will need to raise further capital. So far Ceremorphic is self-funded with Mattela and friends and family putting together $50 million in a Series A round an extremely small amount of funding relative to AI chip startups such as SambaNova that have received billions in venture capital.

Mattela's preferred route to future funding he said is through partnerships though a formal Series B investment round is also a possibility in 2023.

The first instantiation of the HLP will be as a PCI card that bundles together what the chip needs to function in a computer system. ""Typical system OEMs are the target"" he said. That route to market he believes will make his machine more broadly available.

""Every company needs a training supercomputer"" he said. ""I want to provide the training supercomputer that can be affordable to every enterprise.""

In contrast to something mammoth such as Facebook's

Research SuperComputer for AI -- 6080 GPUs and 175 petabytes of flash storage -- the Ceremorphic PCI blade would be intended to make the technology more accessible.

""If I can provide one-tenth of a building size computer in a box that's the sweet spot.""

While his part is not yet shipping Mattela is already predicting a rapid shakeout in the AI chip startup market. The challengers such as Graphcore have raised a lot of money and made very little revenue; he speculates just a fraction of what Nvidia makes in a quarter off of AI.

""There are four to five companies today; they have close to five billion today [in capital raised] that's a lot of money"" said Mattela. But ""the number one company every quarter makes two billion dollars"" referring to Nvidia's data center revenue.

""If you don't even make 1% of the number one company and you're losing money that's not a business"" said Mattela.

The shakeout will come sooner rather than later Mattela prophesies because of profligacy.

Auto executives expect EVs on average to account for 52% of all sales by 2030. Accordingly investing in new computing technologies and EV platforms is key.

While the battery is the heart of the EV intelligently engineering the car's “brain” is equally important. The EV’s computer is responsible for controlling a plethora of functions—ranging from regenerative-braking feedback to infotainment operation to battery management to instrument cluster operation. Specifically embedded chips like the CPU enable these features.

Modernized solutions like GM’s Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise claim to effectively handle 95% of driving scenarios. Ultra Cruise alone will leverage a new AI-capable 5nm processor. Drivers are demanding improved safety features like advanced lane centering emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. In fact Volkswagen’s ID.4 EV received poor marks from buyers because it lacked such core capabilities.

What other hardware-level developments have manufacturers unveiled?

Sony Enters the EV Fray

At CES 2022 Sony announced its intention to form a new company called Sony Mobility. This offshoot will be dedicated solely to exploring EV development—building on Sony’s 2020 VISION-S research initiative. While Sony unveiled its coup EV prototype two years ago dubbed VISION-S 01 this year’s VISION-S 02 prototype is an SUV. However the company hasn’t committed to bringing these cars to mass-market consumers themselves.

It’s said that both Qualcomm and NVIDIA have been involved throughout the development process. However the two prominent electronics manufacturers haven’t made their involvement with Sony clear (and vice versa). Tesla has adopted NVIDIA hardware to support its machine-learning algorithms; it’s therefore possible that Sony has taken similar steps.

Additionally NVIDIA has long touted its DRIVE Orin SoC DRIVE Hyperion and DRIVE AGX Pegasus SoC/GPU. These are specifically built to power autonomous vehicles. The same can be said for its DRIVE Sim program which enables self-driving simulations based on dynamic data.

The Sony VISION-S 02 features a number of internal displays and driver-monitoring features. This is where Qualcomm’s involvement may begin. The chipmaker previously introduced the Snapdragon Digital Chassis a hardware-software suite that supports the following:

Advanced driver-assistance feature development

4G 5G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity

Virtual assistance voice control and graphical information

Car-to-Cloud connectivity

Navigation and GPS

It’s unclear if any of Sony’s EVs are reliant on either supplier for in-cabin functionality or overall development. However both companies have a vested interest in the EV-AV market and at least have held consulting roles with Sony for two years.

Hyundai and IonQ Join Forces

Since Hyundai unveiled its BlueOn electric car in 2010 the company has been hard at work developing improved EVs behind the scenes. These efforts have led to recent releases of the IONIQ EV and Kona Electric. However the automaker concedes that battery challenges have plagued the ownership experience of EVs following their market launch. Batteries continue to suffer wear and tear from charge and discharge cycling. Capacities have left something to be desired as have overall durability and safety throughout an EV’s lifespan.

A recent partnership with quantum-computing experts at IonQ aims to solve many of these problems. Additionally the duo hopes to lower battery costs while improving efficiency along the way. IonQ’s quantum processors are doing the legwork here—alongside the company’s quantum algorithms. The goal is to study lithium-based battery chemistries while leveraging Hyundai’s data and expertise in the area.

By 2025 Hyundai is aiming to introduce more than 12 battery electric vehicles (BEVs) to consumers. Batteries remain the most expensive component in all EVs and there’s a major incentive to reduce their costs and pass savings down to consumers. This will boost EV uptake. While the partnership isn’t supplying Hyundai vehicles with hardware components at scale the venture could help Hyundai design better chip-dependent battery-management systems in the future.

Mercedes-Benz Delivers Smarter Operation

Stemming from time in the lab including contributions from Formula 1 and Formula E Mercedes-Benz has developed its next-generation VISION EQXX vehicle. A major selling point of Mercedes’ newest EV is the cockpit design—which features displays and graphics spanning the vehicle’s entire width. The car is designed to be human-centric and actually mimic the human mind during operation.

How is this possible? The German automaker has incorporated BrainChip’s Akida neural processor and associated software suite. This chipset powers the EQXX’s onboard systems and runs spiking neural networks. This operation saves power by only consuming energy during periods of learning or processing. Such coding dramatically lowers energy consumption.

Additionally it makes driver interaction much smoother via voice control. Keyword recognition is now five to ten times more accurate than it is within competing systems according to Mercedes. The result is described as a better driving experience while markedly reducing AI energy needs across the vehicle’s entirety. The EQXX and EVs after it will think in much more humanistic ways and support continuous learning. By doing so Mercedes hopes to continually refine the driving experience throughout periods of extended ownership across hundreds of thousands of miles.

The Future of EV Electronics

While companies have achieved Level 2+ autonomy through driver-assistance packages upgradeable EV software systems may eventually unlock fully-fledged self-driving. Accordingly chip-level innovations are surging forward to meet future demand.

It’s clear that EV development has opened numerous doors for electrical engineers and design teams. The inclusion of groundbreaking new components rooted in AI and ML will help drivers connect more effectively with their vehicles. Interestingly different automakers are taking different approaches on both software and hardware fronts.

Harmonizing these two facets of EV computing will help ensure a better future for battery-powered cars—making them more accessible and affordable to boot.",,,,,,,,,

Apple Inc teased its metaverse ambitions on Thursday as CEO Tim Cook talked expansion of the company’s augmented reality apps prompting strong investor response.

The company has 14000 AR apps on its App Store and Cook suggested this number will rise with further investment.

“We see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly” said Cook in response to a question about its plans for the metaverse a broad term that generally refers to shared virtual world environments that people can access via the internet.

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Bloomberg have reported Apple plans to introduce an AR headset by this or next year with glasses to follow later. Apple has not yet publicly acknowledged these plans.

Cook’s comments on Thursday and quarterly profit and sales topping estimates helped drive Apple stock up nearly 5% in after-hours trade.

Apple’s services revenue jumped by 24% to $19.5 billion in the just-ended holiday quarter topping analysts’ estimates of $18.6 billion. The company added 785 million subscribers to its handful of paid services such as for streaming music and playing games an increase from 620 million a year ago and 745 million last quarter.

Cook separately on Thursday said that Apple’s research and development efforts are focused on the intersection of hardware software and services.

“That’s where the magic really happens” Cook said. “There’s quite a bit of investment going into things that are not on the market at this point.”

An AR device could open many opportunities to grow subscriptions. Existing offerings for fitness workouts and video content could grow more attractive through immersive AR experiences.

And as the services and subscribers have grown Apple’s gross profit margins have jumped above 40% drawing praise from analysts.

Metaverse-related services such as AR apps could flip Apple’s revenue mix said analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research.

“There is a significant upside to Apple’s services business potentially crossing its iPhone in the next five years” Shah said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBob2Jsb2dyYXBoZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMzAvYXBwbGVzLXNob3Qtb24taXBob25lLWNvbnRlc3QtaGFzLWEtYmlnLXByb2JsZW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple's Shot on iPhone Contest Has a Big Problem,"Spread the love

Technically speaking Apple’s New Shot on iPhone Contest has a minimum entry fee of around $1000. It’s not a literal fee but you can only enter if you’re using their latest iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max. The Shot on iPhone contest has been around for years but the prizes haven’t really gotten any better. Photographers as it is are hesitant about entering contests and what the contests actually do for photographers. And in this case it’s a tone-deaf tech company that cares more about its product than about photographers.

You can view this article and much more with minimal banner ads in our brand new app for iOS iPadOS and Android. And for $24.99/year you can have a banner ad-free experience.

Let’s compare this to the Sony World Photo Awards for example. When you enter you don’t need to be using a Sony camera or even a Sony phone. But for Shot on iPhone you need to be using their latest iPhone. Surely most folks don’t have seriously great reasons to need to upgrade to the latest iPhone. When I entered the tech world years ago I even wondered why journalists would upgrade every year. I concluded that there’s a difference between need and want. And that’s precisely the case here.

The contest is being judged with a few big names and you have the chance to have your image displayed on Apple’s Instagram their newsroom and on their website. But that’s it. Is it a prestigious award? Not really. Is it cool that Apple chose you to showcase a fleeting piece of technology? Sure. But again I doubt it will do anything for you as a photographer.

I say this as someone who’s judged many contests has our content included in school curriculum (which adds to our accreditation) and as someone who’s hosted a number of contests myself. Further I’m the former Vice-Chairman of APA NY and helped push the non-profit in many ways. Apple’s contest feels like just an opportunity for them to market their own product more than anything else.

But let’s not just bash Apple. Instead let’s discuss how Apple could’ve done better:

Teaming up with a camera company to give away a camera kit of some sort.

Teaming up with Profoto to give away a lighting kit with LEDs and flash.

Offering the user a brand new MacBook Pro so that they can advance their photo career. It would have either the full Adobe Suite or Capture One fully paid for for a year.

A cash prize of at least $50000 because Apple can easily afford it.

A full scholarship of some sort of institution that teaches photography and helps photographers become gainfully employed.

Working with the judges on portfolio critiques and private zoom/networking sessions.

A commercial featuring the photographer shot by Apple.

These are just a start. The most profitable company in the world could’ve surely found a way to give back to the photography community. But instead the contest feels like a way to outsource their marketing efforts. If it were a smaller company I’d probably let it go. But Apple isn’t a small company by any means.

How can Apple make this even better? Find ways to do this for the LGBTQ+ community women and minorities. Apple likes to push inclusivity in very subtle ways. But they can lean into it for the good of the future of photography.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEvMjkvam9uaS1taXRjaGVsbC1qb2luaW5nLW5laWwteW91bmctaW4tcHJvdGVzdC1vdmVyLXNwb3RpZnnSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMS8yOS9qb25pLW1pdGNoZWxsLWpvaW5pbmctbmVpbC15b3VuZy1pbi1wcm90ZXN0LW92ZXItc3BvdGlmeQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joni Mitchell joins Neil Young; pulls music in Spotify protest,"Move against audio streaming company comes after comedian Joe Rogan’s podcast with health expert accused of spreading COVID misinformation.

Joni Mitchell said she is seeking to remove all of her music from Spotify in solidarity with Neil Young who ignited a protest against the streaming service for airing a podcast that featured a figure who has spread misinformation about the coronavirus.

Mitchell who like Young is a California-based songwriter who had much of her success in the 1970s is the first prominent musician to join Young’s effort.

“Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives” Mitchell said on Friday in a message posted on her website. “I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.”

Following Young’s action this week Spotify said it had policies in place to remove misleading content from its platform and has removed more than 20000 podcast episodes related to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.

Joe Rogan controversy

But the service has said nothing about comedian Joe Rogan whose podcast The Joe Rogan Experience is the centerpiece of the controversy.

Last month Rogan interviewed on his podcast Dr Robert Malone an infectious disease specialist who has been banned from Twitter for spreading COVID misinformation.

Rogan is one of the streaming service’s biggest stars with a contract that could earn him more than $100m.

Young called on other artists to support him following his action. While Mitchell 78 is not a current hitmaker the Canadian’s Spotify page said she had 3.7 million monthly listeners to her music. Her songs Big Yellow Taxi and A Case of You have both been streamed more than 100 million times on the service.

In a message on his website on Friday Young said “when I left Spotify I felt better.

“Private companies have the right to choose what they profit from just as I can choose not to have my music support a platform that disseminates harmful information” he wrote. “I am happy and proud to stand in solidarity with the front-line health care workers who risk their lives every day to help others.”

Bundles of nanowires were exposed to a gas of chalcogen atoms and heat which helped merge the threads into narrow strips. Nanoribbons are highly sought after for sophisticated electronic devices; given the scalability of the method the team hopes it will see widespread use in the industrial production of cutting-edge materials.

Materials science in the electronics age is as demanding as it is revolutionary. As circuitry get smaller faster and more energy efficient scientists are faced with the increasingly difficult challenge of controlling the atomic-level structure of the materials that are used in them. One promising avenue of research is the use of intricate threads of material only a few atoms wide; one such structure is composed of transition-metal chalcogenides a combination of transition metals and chalcogens atoms which share a column with oxygen on the periodic table. These atomically thin “nanowires” possess properties unique to their one-dimensional structure and are highly sought after for sophisticated electronic devices. But what they have in minuteness they lack in tunability. This is where “nanoribbons” come in that is narrow atomically thin sheets. Fine control of their width for example leads to controlled variation in their electronic and magnetic properties.

A great deal of work has been applied to “build” nanoribbons from the bottom up. The problem however is that such methods aren’t very scalable. That’s a problem for producing bulk quantities for commercial devices. Now a team led by Dr. Hong En Lim and Associate Professor Yasumitsu Miyata from Tokyo Metropolitan University have come up with a scalable way of assembling nanowires into nanoribbons. The team had already pioneered ways to produce nanowires in bulk quantities. By taking some tungsten telluride nanowires they created bundles of wires deposited on a flat substrate. These were exposed to vapors of different chalcogens like sulfur selenium and tellurium. With a combination of heat and vapor the initially separate threads in the bundles were successfully woven together into narrow atomically thin “nanoribbons” with a characteristic zigzag structure. By tuning the thickness of the original bundles they could even choose whether these ribbons were oriented parallel to the substrate or perpendicular to it thanks to a competition between how favorable it is to have edges or faces parallel to the bottom surface. Furthermore by tuning the substrate on which the bundles are placed they could control whether the ribbons were randomly oriented or pointing in a single direction. Importantly the method is scalable and may be applied to take the synthesis from lab-scale manufacture of a few ribbons to bulk syntheses over large substrate areas.

The team were able to confirm that the ribbons they created had the exotic electronic properties which are unique to their one-dimensional nature. Not only is this a big leap forward for materials science but a tangible step towards seeing mass-produced nanoribbons in state-of-the-art electronics optoelectronics and catalysts.

Some concluded that it posed a threat to Western economies and perhaps even to global security. In news headlines Huawei a brilliantly successful manufacturer of telecoms equipment became the face of that threat. America accused the firm of acting as a conduit for Chinese government surveillance and control. In 2018 America clobbered Huawei. It banned the export to the Chinese firm of American microchips essential for its products. This seems to have had the desired effect. Last year Huawei’s revenues shrank for the first time in a decade by almost a third.

It was unprecedented for a state to stymie so huge a tech company. Huawei’s revenues were about as big as Microsoft’s. But the feat was not without costs. Because the Trump administration acted without co-operating closely with America’s friends it prompted investors from far and wide to add missing links to parts of the semiconductor supply chain that are beyond the reach of American law.",,,

Swiss federal prosecutors are seeking more than 42 million francs (€40 million) in compensation from Credit Suisse Group AG stemming from a 14-year investigation into the lender’s alleged failure to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian drug ring.

Switzerland’s federal criminal court unveiled the charges in a 500-page document that alleged the bank suffered from “serious organisational shortcomings” in preventing money laundering according to a report published Sunday by SonntagsZeitung.

The Swiss federal prosecutor alleged that the Bulgarian drug mafia led by a former wrestler deposited some 55 million francs at Credit Suisse -- much of it hand-delivered in suitcases filled with unbundled notes according to the report. The federal prosecutor also targeted a former Credit Suisse employee for her role in the affair.

The bank said it “unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it and is convinced that its former employee is innocent” according to an emailed statement. “The bank will defend itself vigorously in court.”

The development marks the latest blow for the embattled bank which recently announced it would set aside an additional 500 million francs for litigation this year.

The bank is still reeling from steep losses related to the collapse of Archegos Capital Management and Greensill Capital. Its nascent reboot was stymied after former chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio was ousted after nine months on the job.

This is only the second time the Swiss federal prosecutor has ever taken a bank to court following the Falcon bank probe into money laundering tied to the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.

In addition to the federal prosecutor’s compensation claim Credit Suisse faces a maximum penalty of 5 million francs. The case begins next week and is scheduled to last for a total of 20 days according to the report.

They arrived in masks per COVID-19 guidelines Jenner in black leggings and Bieber in olive. Jenner was wearing a light grey hoodie and Bieber carried a small purse slung over her green zip-up jacket with a tall collar. Both wore shades as they entered the studio and shoes matching their respective outfits.

Bieber carried her jacket revealing an asymmetric top that matched her leggings and a thin chain around her neck. There was another chain hanging across her defined stomach in two loops.

Jenner and Bieber have been close friends for years. In a 2018 interview with Elle Jenner said “[Hailey] was actually best friends with Kylie and I was good friends with her cousin Ireland [Baldwin]... Hailey lived in New York and whenever we were there we would hang out with her … From then on she was my homie.”

She added “At first Kylie [Jenner] was mad; I had to bring them back together and be like ‘No it’s okay guys.’ But it’s all good; that’s our love story.”

Hailey Bieber is married to Justin Bieber and Jenner has been seen socializing with the couple. In October of 2021 they were spotted at a Los Angeles Lakers game at the Staples Center in Los Angeles where Jenner's boyfriend Devin Booker was playing for the Phoenix Suns.

Many have tried to break this record including former World's Strongest Man title holder Eddie Hall but none have succeeded.

This striking power has clearly helped Ngannou to dominate his opponents in the octagon but it has also led to a surge in athletes and fitness influencers offering themselves up to be hit by the Cameroonian fighter. So it stands to reason that the stars of Jackass arguably the O.G. masochistic content creators would want to get in on the action.

The fourth movie spinoff from the popular MTV series Jackass Forever features a guest appearance by Ngannou who was invited to take part in a ""cup test"" scene where he would demonstrate his legendary punching power and hit cast member Ehren McGhehey in the groin as hard as he could.

""I told Ehren it was a lightweight"" jokes Johnny Knoxville moments before the scene is due to be filmed. ""I didn't tell him it was a heavyweight!"" (Knoxville has sustained his own fair share of crotch-related injuries in his time including breaking his penis in a motorcycle accident. He recently assured fans that it is now in ""working order"" again.)



Steve-O adds that taking this punch from Ngannou was the moment where McGhehey finally became a ""star"" in his own right. ""I'm a UFC man so I heard Francis Ngannou was gonna be there and I was like I want to do it please!"" He says. ""And then later I found out in fact I didn't want to do it... His punch is the equivalent of being hit by a Ford Escort at top speed.""

Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co's robust brokerage segment continues to drive revenue growth.

Strategic acquisitions bolster the company's service offerings and geographic reach.

Global economic volatility and competitive pressures present ongoing challenges.

Technological advancements and ESG initiatives offer pathways for future growth.

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) a leading global insurance brokerage and consulting firm filed its 10-Q on May 1 2024 revealing key financial and operational data. The company's primary revenue streams stem from its brokerage segment with significant contributions from its corporate segment including clean energy investment and other investment income. The United States remains AJG's largest market complemented by substantial operations in Australia Bermuda Canada the Caribbean New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats as presented in the recent SEC filings providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of AJG's market position and potential investment value.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats. AJG's forward-looking strategies including leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring long-term success.

Surf City

À quelques 100 kilomètres au sud de San Franciscoest uneau sens propre du terme alors que les spots y déroulent au détour des rues bordant la côte. La ville se dispute d'ailleurs la dénomination deavec Huntington beach et nombre de Californiens y vont de leur opinion pour déterminer à laquelle des deux villes le nom propre devrait référer. C'est sûrement là un débat du même acabit que le pain au chocolat versus la chocolatine qui sûrement jamais n'aura de résolution unanime.

Ici au nord de la Californie on trouve plus d'une vingtaine de spots assurant un surf constant et varié tout au long de l'année. Pointbreaks reefbreaks et beachbreaks s'y partagent les houles de sud mais aussi celles venues de l'ouest du nord-ouest et du nord qui s'enroulent autour de la côte escarpée de la ville.

Un terrain de jeu comme celui-ci brasse bien du monde et ces spots sont aussi réputés comme extrêmement bondés. En avril 2021 le comté de Santa Cruz comptait plus de 270.000 habitants. Cela signifie que même si seulement 1% de la population surfait (ce qui paraît pessimiste) déjà 2700 surfeurs devraient se partager leurs homespots ! Sans compter les surfeurs d'autres villes et voyageurs en trip venus en nombre goûter à l'excellence californienne...

As his life and study in New York City were put on pause during the pandemic Shuli returned to his hometown Wenzhou China. He bought a Super 8 mm camera and started filming his loved ones without a precise intention.

Back home with his parents Shuli found himself confronted by the past and lingering tensions with his mother. As his need to discuss his truth became overwhelming Shuli turned the camera on himself and his family.

The distanced gaze of the lens seemed to provide the courage and justification he needed to have the difficult conversations with his mother that he’d been putting off. The making of the film which Shuli titled “Will You Look at Me” offered a way for mother and son who love each other but struggle to set aside personal and cultural expectations to see each other.

Shuli Huang is a Chinese writer director and cinematographer based in New York. “Will You Look at Me” won the 2022 Golden Horse Award for best documentary short film the Queer Palm for best short film at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival and the 2023 Sundance Film Festival’s nonfiction short award.

Then the suspect’s relative is found dead in the gunman’s home,"CNN —

An armed man gave no warning as he walked toward the front of Jesus’ Dwelling Place Church in Pennsylvania on Sunday raised a gun toward the pastor’s face and pulled the trigger.

What happened next may have been divine intervention Pastor Glenn Germany said.

“I’m thankful to God that I’m still here because he definitely pulled the trigger” Germany told CNN affiliate WTAE.

The gunman “attempted to shoot but the firearm failed to discharge” Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement.

The incident in North Braddock was captured on the church’s livestreamed video. Immediately after the gunman pulled the trigger a church member tackled the suspect to the ground.

Police say Bernard Polite tried to shoot a pastor in North Braddock but the gun wouldn't discharge. Jesus' Dwelling Place Church

State police identified the suspect as 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite.

It’s not clear why the suspect tried to shoot the pastor. Germany said he had never seen the gunman before Sunday WTAE reported.

“All of a sudden I just seen a gun pointing right at me” the pastor told the affiliate. “And at that point all I could do was run for cover.”

As Germany ran and hid behind a lectern the church’s cameraman rushed the gunman and tackled him to the ground according to WTAE. The pastor quickly emerged from behind the lectern and helped subdue the suspect.

Polite faces charges of attempted criminal homicide aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person court records show.

He was arraigned early Monday morning and was denied bail. He is being held at Allegheny County Jail and his preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 13.

It was not immediately clear if Polite has an attorney.

After the attempted shooting at the church police found the body of a man who was shot in Polite’s home Allegheny County police told CNN. The homicide victim was identified as 56-year-old Derek Polite a relative of the suspect from the church incident.

“County Police can confirm Bernard Polite a suspect in a previous incident Sunday morning at a North Braddock church is known to live at the residence where the shooting occurred and is a relative of the shooting victim” police spokesperson Jim Madalinsky told CNN in an email.

“At this point no charges have been filed in connection with the homicide and it remains an active investigation.”

A makeshift United defence that included Casemiro at centre-back was easily picked apart by Palace on several occasions as Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell joined the scoresheet in the impressive win.

- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga Bundesliga more (U.S.)

United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games two points behind Newcastle United in sixth with their hopes of European football next season fading fast. Palace are still in 14th with 43 points from 36 matches.

United had several injury absentees and were without Bruno Fernandes the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career he has missed a match with injury but the ease with which they were beaten will be a huge concern for everyone at the club.

""A big disappointment. We just had an off-day and we weren't in it"" midfielder Christian Eriksen told the BBC. ""It is what it is. We can't really change the injury things. We have to do what we can on the pitch to change it.

""Today it didn't matter who we played. Everyone could have done better. We tried to do what we could but we were not good enough. We'll take the blame as players.""

It is the first time in the Premier League era United have lost 13 games in a season and the scoreline might have been worse.

Palace have found their groove under new manager Oliver Glasner but United are limping to the end of a season that cannot finish soon enough for Ten Hag.

The home side took the lead inside 12 minutes and it was far too easy. Olise collected a throw and evaded a limp challenge from Casemiro and with no United player attempting to close him down was able to unleash a low shot from just inside the box.

United had the ball in the back of the net from Casemiro's header but the effort was ruled out after contact from Rasmus Højlund on Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson.

It was 2-0 to the home side five minutes before the break as Mateta breezed past United defender Jonny Evans and thrashed the ball into the net for a ninth goal in 11 games since the arrival of Glasner in February.

The striker had scored 11 goals in his previous 80 games for Palace.

United's defence was struggling to contain the movement of their hosts and when Diogo Dalot failed to deal with a ball to the back post Mitchell had a tap-in with home players queuing up to score.

Olise's second goal added more salt to the wound and it could have been worse for the visitors as Odsonne Édouard saw his shot come back off the woodwork late on.

""I think we could have got a few more. That shows the potential we have to play against any team in the league"" Palace defender Chris Richards said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Byby1wYWxlc3Rpbmlhbi1wcm90ZXN0ZXJzLXJldGFrZS1taXQtMDQwOTA4MDA2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pro-Palestinian protesters retake MIT encampment occupy building at Rhode Island School of Design,"Demonstrators tear down barricades that had been erected outside a pro-Palestinian encampment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Monday May 6 2024 in Cambridge Mass.

NEW YORK (AP) — A Monday deadline for pro-Palestinian protesters to leave an encampment at Massachusetts Institute of Technology cleared many demonstrators only to have the site retaken while protesters at the Rhode Island School of Design began occupying a building in the ongoing protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war.

At MIT protesters were given an afternoon deadline in which to voluntarily leave the protest site or face suspension. Many left according to an MIT spokesperson who said protesters breached fencing after the arrival of demonstrators from outside the university. On Monday night dozens of protesters remained at the encampment in a calmer atmosphere listening to speakers and chanting before taking a pizza dinner break.

Sam Ihns a graduate student at MIT studying mechanical engineering and a member of MIT Jews for a Ceasefire said the group has been at the encampment for the past two weeks and that they were calling for an end to the killing in Gaza.

“Specifically our encampment is protesting MIT’s direct research ties to the Israeli Ministry of Defense” he said.

Earlier in the day Erica Caple James a professor of medical anthropology and urban studies at MIT attended the protests as a faculty observer and an adviser to the Alliance of Concerned Faculty.

“My hope is that the day ends without harm befalling anyone without there being physical violence and hopefully with space to open negotiations again between the administration and students faculty and staff who are concerned about MIT’s global influence” she said.

No arrests had been made as of Monday night according to the MIT spokesperson.

At the Rhode Island School of Design where students started occupying a building Monday a spokesperson said the school affirms students’ rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly and that they support all members of their community. The RISD president and provost were on site meeting with the demonstrators the spokesperson said.

Demonstrations at Columbia University where the protest movement began about three weeks ago have roiled its campus. Officials on Monday canceled its large main ceremony but said students will be able to celebrate at a series of smaller school-based ceremonies this week and next.

The decision comes as universities around the country wrangle with how to handle commencements for students whose high school graduations were derailed by COVID-19 in 2020. Another campus shaken by protests Emory University announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its Atlanta campus to a suburban arena. Others including the University of Michigan Indiana University and Northeastern have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.

Columbia’s decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president Minouche Shafik from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week. The Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said it made the decision after discussions with students.

Columbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia’s green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.

Similar encampments sprouted up elsewhere as universities struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.

The University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.

Other universities have held graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday.

Emory’s ceremonies scheduled for May 13 will be held almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university’s Atlanta campus President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.

“Please know that this decision was not taken lightly” Fenves wrote. “It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department security advisors and other agencies — each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.”

The 16000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests stemming from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel killing about 1200 people mostly civilians and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.

Vowing to destroy Hamas Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34500 Palestinians about two-thirds of them women and children according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.

Hamas on Monday announced its acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal but Israel said the deal did not meet its “core demands” and that it was pushing ahead with an assault on the southern Gaza town of Rafah.

“Cease-fires are temporary” said Selina Al-Shihabi a Georgetown University sophomore who was taking part in a protest at George Washington. “There can be a cease-fire but the U.S. government will continue to arm the Israeli military. We plan to be here until the university divests or until they drag us out of here.”

At the University of California San Diego police cleared an encampment and arrested more than 64 people including 40 students.

The University of California Los Angeles moved all classes online for the week due to ongoing disruptions following the dismantling of an encampment last week which resulted in 44 reported arrests.

Chancellor Gene Block said Monday night that UCLA’s newly appointed chief safety officer would lead an investigation to identify and prosecute the “group of instigators” who led a violent attack on pro-Palestinian demonstrators on April 30. The university has asked Los Angeles police the FBI and the district attorney’s office for assistance Block said.

Schools are trying various tactics from appeasement to threats of disciplinary action to get protestors to take down encampments or move to other areas of campus.

The School of the Art Institute of Chicago said in a Facebook post Sunday that it offered protesters “amnesty from academic sanction and trespassing charges” if they moved and that many protesters voluntarily left.

“Those that remained were arrested"" the school said.

A group of faculty and staff members at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill asked the administration for amnesty for student protesters who were recently arrested and suspended. UNC Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine said in a media advisory that it would deliver a letter on behalf of more than 500 faculty who support the student activists.

Harvard University's interim president Alan Garber warned students that those participating in a pro-Palestinian encampment in Harvard Yard could face “involuntary leave.” That means they would not be allowed on campus could lose their student housing and may not be able to take exams Garber said.

As soon as you switch them on smart TVs made by the likes of LG Samsung and Sony are gathering data from the TV itself as well as from the operating system and apps. Then there are the devices you plug into your TV such as Google’s Chromecast Apple TV and Amazon’s Fire Stick.

A TV is no longer just a device for showing you content – it has become a two-way mirror allowing you to be observed in real time by a network of advertisers and data brokers says Rowenna Fielding director of data protection consultancy Miss IG Geek. “The purpose of this is to gather as much information as possible about your behaviour interests preferences and demographics so it can be monetised mainly through targeted advertising.”

Smart TV spying is difficult to avoid. A study by researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London found data from TVs and smart devices was sent to Google’s ad business and to Netflix even if people didn’t have Netflix.

What does your smart TV know about you?

The data collected by your smart TV depends on its manufacturer brand and version. In theory most smart TVs are capable of collecting audio video and TV usage data says Toby Lewis global head of threat analysis at cybersecurity company Darktrace.

Voice activation is one feature with the potential to gather large amounts of data. Microphones and software are listening for instructions and they can capture conversations and other sounds within range. These recordings might be sent to third parties to be analysed.

Cross-device tracking is another issue to consider. Data collected via your smart TV is more valuable when combined with information from other smart devices such as mobile phones laptops and home automation gear according to Fielding. “This allows individuals to be profiled in detail: geo-location history web browsing activity and social media information can be added to TV data.”

Then there are the cookies and trackers. Apps and browsers on smart TVs use cookie- and pixel-tracking technologies just like websites do to track recognise and identify devices for user-profiling. “Most apps installed on your smart TV will be snitching to a large network of advertisers and data brokers” Fielding warns.

What does your TV do with the data?

There is no clear-cut answer. What exactly is done with the data is complex and “highly opaque” says Lewis. “When looking at what a smart TV does on the network it is often unclear why certain data is being harvested and where it is being sent.”

There is not much difference between TV brands. Manufacturers claim to use your information for “personalisation” and quality of content but it is common to sell this type of data anonymised or semi-anonymised to third parties advertising companies or streaming services. “After the data has been sold it is out of the manufacturer’s control” Lewis says. “It is often unclear what data exactly is being sent back depending on the T&Cs and privacy settings and it can be very difficult to change default settings once you have agreed to them.”

How streaming services are also gathering data

Using streaming services on a smart TV is another surefire way to hand over lots of your personal data. Apps such as Netflix Amazon Prime and Now TV tend to claim they only use data for necessary services such as recommendations or credit checks. But this can include data such as device identifiers geo-location browser type email address and payment information.

Netflix’s powerful recommendations algorithm fuels the quality of its service by helping you choose which shows to watch. If you log on to Netflix via your browser you can tweak the privacy settings to limit the data that’s collected and shared. Yet most of the data Netflix gathers such as the shows you watched and when is so core to its service that you can’t opt out of it.

What is automatic content recognition or ACR?

Back to the smart TV itself. One scary feature to look out for is automated content recognition (ACR). Often turned on by default this uses analytical techniques to identify video and audio running on the TV matching it against a big database to identify what’s being played. It’s pretty creepy stuff – ACR works on anything played on the TV including DVDs and Blu-rays CDs and games.

Viewing data and habits are shared with manufacturers and ultimately sold to advertisers in order to target you with ads says Jake Moore global cybersecurity adviser at security company ESET. When your TV is connected to your home router data will include your IP address and location too he adds.

And in theory ACR could be used for even more unsettling profiling says Lewis. “With the analytical technologies available data from facial recognition sentiment analysis speech-to-text and content analysis could be gathered to build an in-depth picture of an individual user.”

Instead of matching content against a list of known movies ACR could in theory be analysed for political position ethnicity socioeconomic position and other things that could be abused in the wrong hands Lewis says.

Should you use your TV as a browser or your smartphone as a TV remote?

Using the browser on your TV might be convenient but it’s a major attack target for hackers. This is because your smart TV browser lacks the antivirus and additional security settings built into your smartphone or PC.

“Cyber-attackers can eavesdrop on the browser’s traffic and compromise the cookies that manage authentication to online services such as social media accounts or online banking and impersonate people” says Dr Francisco Navarro a senior lecturer at De Montfort University’s Cyber Security Centre in Leicester.

But in contrast experts say using your smartphone as a TV remote is fine. Just be mindful that connecting to a smart TV with a mobile will be done via Bluetooth or across the network says James Griffiths cofounder and technical director at security consultancy Cyber Security Associates. “If the smart TV was hacked it might be used to attack your mobile device but the risk of this happening is low.”

Protect yourself from smart TV spying

As long as they are connected to the internet smart TVs will collect data and you can’t stop this from happening altogether. In many instances it’s not in your interests to do so as it will affect your viewing experience – take Netflix’s useful recommendations features as an example.

Yet there are some basic measures you can take to protect yourself from smart TV spying. Turn off ACR in the settings disable personalisation opt out of all advertising features and cover or disable cameras and microphones.

It’s also important to make sure your router is protected by changing the password and setting up a guest network. You can improve security by opting out of web tracking when it’s offered and applying software updates as soon as they’re available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9hY2NlbGVyYXRlZC1kaXN0cmlidXRlZC10cmFpbmluZy13aXRoLXRlbnNvcmZsb3ctb24tZ29vZ2xlcy10cHUtNTJmMWZlMjFkYTMz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Accelerated Distributed Training with TensorFlow on Google's TPU,"Accelerated Distributed Training with TensorFlow on Google’s TPU

The city did however welcome a few new businesses in a variety of different sectors from hair supply to oilfield services.

""Our businsess are doing extremely well"" Mayor David Kline said. ""Obviously I still see employment signs and companies need to hire people but that's nationwide. I think our restaurants are struggling a bit because of manpower but all in all I think there's not a whole lot of vacancies in town and when a building is empty we get phone calls and it's soon filling back up.""

As of Jan. 5 the city had only 10600 square feet of industrial space and 43.8 acres of industrial land available economic development director Matt Springer said. There is also 54258 square feet available for commercial space about 67% of which is retail and 32% is office space. There is 23.47 acres of vacant commercial land.

Springer speculated that the vacant land is moving slowly because of delays due to the increased cost of materials.

Here's a look at some of the businesses that came to Tallmadge this past year:

Goodwill Industries 501 South Ave. returned to Tallmadge in December after closing its Midway Plaza location in 2020. As planned the new store next to Planet Fitness is smaller than its former site.

Minnix Auto Sales 431 West Ave. Unit A is a family-owned pre-owned car dealership that opened in April. Zac Minnix who previously ran car dealerships and his father David a retired businesssman had been talking about starting a business together for 10 years and finally began looking for a space about two years ago.

Baker Hughes 184 South Ave. an oilfield services company opened a regional headquarters in Massillon in 2013 but moved to Tallmadge after the building was sold to Frito Lay for distribution. The 108-acre Massillon site was listed in February for $6.25 million. Baker Hughes' new 25800 square foot home in Tallmadge was previously occupied by Kyoto Cooling.

Springer said Baker Hughes moved about 22 employees into the Tallmadge space with an average salary of about $90000.

The popular American singer and songwriter Anita Denise Baker turned 64 on Wednesday. She was one of the most popular singers of soulful ballads during the height of the quiet storm period in the 1980s. Starting her career in the late 1970s with the funk band Chapter 8 Baker released her first solo album The Songstress in 1983.

In 1986 she rose to stardom following the release of her Platinum-selling second album Rapture which included the Grammy-winning single “Sweet Love”. As of 2017 Baker has won eight Grammy Awards and has five Platinum albums along with one Gold album. Baker is a mezzo soprano with a vocal range that extends her register to at least three octaves. 1958–79: Early life career beginnings and Chapter 8 Anita Baker was born on January 26 1958 in Toledo Ohio.

When she was two years old it was reported that her mother abandoned her hence she was raised by a foster family in Detroit Michigan. When Baker was 12 her foster parents died and her foster sister raised her afterwards. By the time Baker was 16 she began singing R&B at Detroit nightclubs.

After one performance she was discovered by bandleader David Washington who gave her a card to audition for the funk band-Chapter 8. Baker joined Chapter 8 in 1975 and the group toured until securing a deal with Ariola Records in 1979.

The group’s first album Chapter 8 was released that year and featured the singles “Ready for Your Love” a duet between Baker and bandmate Gerald Lyles and the Baker-led “I Just Want to Be Your Girl.”

After Ariola was bought out by Arista Records in 1979 Chapter 8 was dropped by the label who was convinced that Baker as the group’s lead singer didn’t have “star potential.” Baker returned to Detroit working as a waitress and a receptionist until in 1982 Otis Smith a former associate of Ariola convinced Baker to start a solo career under his Beverly Glen label.

After her debut solo album The Songstress in May 1983 the album produced four singles: “No More Tears” and its B-side “Will You Be Mine” “Angel” and “You’re the Best Thing Yet”. “Angel” became Baker’s first top 10 single reaching number five on the R&B charts in late 1983. “You’re the Best Thing Yet” followed it in the R&B top 40 early the following year.

Despite this early success Baker was to later complain that she hadn’t received any royalties from the work. In addition the label delayed work on Baker’s follow-up of The Songstress. By 1984 after two years Baker sought to leave the label but was sued by Smith for breach of contract in 1985.

After months in court debating the matter it was concluded that Baker should be allowed to record for other labels winning the case against Beverly Glen label owner Otis Smith. Baker then signed with the Warner Music Group-associated Elektra Records label in 1985 and began working on her next album.

Her Elektra contract allowed the singer to have creative control and produce her own music. In March 1986 Baker released her second album Rapture.

While sales were initially slow following the release of the album’s debut single “Watch Your Step” Elektra released the mid-tempo ballad “Sweet Love” which became her first pop hit reaching number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 also reaching the UK Top 20.

The album eventually launched three further hit singles including “Caught Up in the Rapture” “No One in the World” and “Same Ole Love (365 Days a Year)”. Throughout 1986 and 1987 Baker promoted the album by touring headlining her first tour

The Rapture Tour a show from which was later released on home video as A Night of Rapture. By 1988 the album had sold over 8 million copies worldwide 5 million of which were sold in the United States alone.

The album resulted in Baker’s winning two Grammy Awards at the 1987 ceremony. In 1987 Baker collaborated with The Winans on their song “Ain’t No Need to Worry” which gave Baker a third Grammy this time in the Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group Choir or Chorus category.",,,,,,,,,

The Christmas Day take-off was the most high-profile step in a 20-year journey by scientists and engineers from Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder to build a next-generation telescope able to expand humanity’s understanding of the universe.

The Webb project’s ambitious scientific goals include searching for the first light after the Big Bang determining how galaxies evolved observing the birth of stars and planets and investigating the potential for life on other planets.

Ball Aerospace designed and manufactured the entire optics system for the Webb telescope which is the largest telescope ever deployed in space. Webb is intended to detect objects up to 400 times fainter than what can be observed by current ground- and space-based telescopes.

“It’s hard to overestimate the impact (of Webb)” said Makenzie Lystrup vice president and general manager of civil space at Ball Aerospace. “I think it’s going to change our understanding of the evolution of our universe and our place in it and help us start to answer questions like are we alone in terms of life out in the universe.”

Meredith MacGregor assistant professor of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder agreed that Webb’s potential impact is exciting for scientists. She said more than 4000 planets have been identified orbiting other stars and Webb’s enhanced capabilities will enable scientists to begin investigating the composition of those planets’ atmospheres which will identify other worlds that could potentially sustain life.

MacGregor said Webb will also enable scientists to look further back in time than was possible with previous telescopes. “We’re going to be able to get a really good look at the early history the first galaxies that were forming in our universe billions of years ago” she said.

Creating revolutionary technology

Achieving such ambitious scientific goals requires a dramatic improvement in telescope performance. Ball had worked on all four of NASA’s “Great Observatories” a series of large space-based telescopes launched between 1990 and 2003. The company’s extensive experience and expertise with designing and building space hardware was a major factor in winning the contract for Webb’s entire optics system.

The Webb telescope is much larger than its predecessors which is a major factor in its huge potential impact.

“Telescopes are essentially like a giant light bucket” CU’s MacGregor said. “You’re trying to collect as much light as possible and so you always want a telescope to be bigger because then you can see farther away and fainter things.”

The major component of space-based telescopes is a primary mirror that captures the infrared light from galaxies stars and planets too far away to be seen with a traditional telescope. The final design for Webb has a 269-square-foot primary mirror almost three times the size of the mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope launched in 1990. Because infrared telescopes performing this kind of science need to be super cold to be effective Webb’s primary mirror and other elements of the telescope are protected from the Sun’s heat by a sunshield the size of a tennis court.

One of the project’s major challenges was determining how to fit such a large telescope into a relatively small rocket. (The diameter of the rocket used to actually take the Webb telescope into space was only 18 feet.) Ball’s design team worked tirelessly to create an architecture that would allow the telescope’s components to be folded to fit into the rocket and then unfurled to full size once the telescope was in orbit.

The final design for the mirror incorporates 18 distinct segments about 4.3 feet in diameter that are designed to work together as one mirror. Each 46-pound mirror segment has seven tiny mechanical motors that move and tilt the individual segments into an alignment that provides peak performance. The motors had to be designed to operate in the cold of deep space with temperatures from minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 425 degrees Fahrenheit.

“The design of the actuators of the mirrors was a big challenge” said Erin Wolf Ball Aerospace’s program manager for Webb.

Worldwide participation

The Webb project required contributions from “best-of-the-best” experts in a broad array of specialties. Lystrup said some 300 companies and universities from around the world were involved in the project at different points. Ball has been involved with the Webb program for more than 20 years with about 1500 employees from across Colorado working on the project at different times.

While aerospace organizations often compete for important projects Lystrup said teamwork was paramount for the companies and universities that were part of the Webb team. She said the individuals and organizations working on Webb were passionate about space science and shared a belief in the importance of the mission.

“It takes everyone coming together with their complementary skills and capabilities to have something like this come to fruition” she said.

Lafayette-based Composite Technology Development Inc. was one of several Colorado companies on the Webb team. CTD tested multiple sections of the Webb telescope to ensure that particular components met the specifications required by the rigors of launch and an extended trip in space. CTD tested the bond joints and components of the framework that holds all the scientific instruments behind Webb’s primary mirror as well as struts that hold the secondary mirror. Testing was done over five years in temperatures from minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Mark Haynes senior engineer in charge of testing said CTD’s feedback ended up decreasing the mass of some carbon-fiber tubes thereby reducing the weight of the telescope a very important side benefit of the company’s methodical work.

EnerSys-ABSL Space Products Inc. of Longmont provided next-generation lithium-ion batteries for the Webb telescope. The challenge for their engineers was designing and manufacturing a rechargeable battery that could withstand both the extreme vibrations of launch and the intense cold of deep space. Their team also had to meet NASA specifications that anticipate a range of other potential issues that could arise during Webb’s extended mission. The Li-ion battery is recharged by Webb’s solar panels and provides supplemental power to the satellite when the solar panels are not generating enough current to sustain operations. Optimal battery performance is vital because ongoing power problems could limit the operations and life of the Webb telescope said Dave Lucero general manager for U.S. Space at EnerSys.

The involvement of so many organizations over such an extended timeline created real management challenges. The design of the telescope and its technical requirements evolved over time in response to technology improvements. Ball and the other companies universities and government agencies involved in the project had to respond to the impacts of that ongoing progress.

“With technology changing and that kind of thing the understanding and expectations of the design and the requirements for the design also can evolve” Wolf said. “What the initial idea and intent was in this document or this requirement might evolve over time so we had to continually communicate with the customer and the vendors. Communication and relationships are a big part of sustaining this kind of long-term program.”

When a project takes decades to complete the impact of employee turnover on productivity and deadlines is a major potential issue.

“There’s a lot of (personnel) challenges just the natural evolution of people in their careers people moving on” Wolf said. “Training and mentorship are just kind of built in naturally to this kind of long program. They have to be. That’s something that Ball does at the grassroots. We have a very strong mentor culture at Ball.”

Overcoming COVID and natural disasters

Like the rest of the world Ball and the other organizations involved in developing the Webb Space Telescope had to contend with the impact of the pandemic. Lystrup said pandemic safety restrictions eliminated much of the face-to-face communication that normally happens during space-science projects but the teams at Ball and other project partners quickly adapted to virtual meetings that kept the lines of communication open and the project moving forward.

Multiple research facilities across the U.S. were involved in development of the Webb telescope with teams from Ball traveling to other facilities for testing and other project-related work. Wolf said the Ball team ended up encountering a slew of natural disasters from the 2013 flood in Boulder County to earthquakes in Los Angeles and a tornado at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. Hurricane Harvey dumped 6 feet of rain in one day on the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston while a Ball team was there.

None of those events slowed down the project Wolf said.

“Webb is a tough telescope” she joked.

Launch-day excitement

The launch of the rocket carrying the Webb telescope garnered media attention around the world. Ball employees and other members of the Webb team watched takeoff from a multitude of locations. Lystrup was at the launch site in French Guiana.

“It’s very emotional because it is the culmination of so many people’s efforts” she said. “It was both thrilling and relieving to see it go off. And that’s just the start of the journey.”

Wolf found the launch “almost surreal” as she watched on a monitor at the Space Telescope Science Institute on the campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

“It was neat to watch how excited everyone was down at the launch site cheering and slapping backs and very excited but in the mission ops (operations) center we were more subdued because it’s our turn after the launch” she said. “We all gave a quick clap and then sat back down at our screens and started monitoring telemetry and getting ready for the next steps.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L211bWJhaS9hbGwtZXllcy1vbi1yZXZpc2VkLXdhcmQtYm91bmRhcmllcy1hcy1zZWMtZ2VhcnMtdXAtZm9yLWNpdmljLWVsZWN0aW9ucy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84OTIxMjQxOC5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9tdW1iYWkvYWxsLWV5ZXMtb24tcmV2aXNlZC13YXJkLWJvdW5kYXJpZXMtYXMtc2VjLWdlYXJzLXVwLWZvci1jaXZpYy1lbGVjdGlvbnMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg5MjEyNDE4LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Poll ball set rolling BMC election may be delayed,"All eyes on revised ward boundaries as SEC gears up for civic elections

MUMBAI: Setting the ball rolling for elections to the BMC and14 other municipal corporations in the state the State Election Commission (SEC) on Saturday chalked out the timeline for finalising boundaries of wards after they were increased in Mumbai and determining multiple panel wards in the other civic bodies.With the timeline stating the final list of ward limits will be published on March 2 the polls to India’s richest civic corporation the BMC are set to be delayed and could possibly be pushed to late March or April.The BMC polls were expected to be held in February as the term of the civic House ends on March 8.Once the new BMC electoral ward limits are decided the lottery for ward reservation too will have to take place before civic elections are held.The number of electoral wards in the city will increase from 227 to 236. The SEC has directed BMC to publish the revised boundaries of wards on February 1 and invite suggestions/objections up to February 14.A hearing on suggestions/objections received will be held on February 26 and a report will be submitted to the SEC by March 2. The same timetable will apply to other corporations including Thane which is also going to the polls.The state cabinet had approved the proposal to increase electoral wards in the BMC and to have multiple panel wards for other corporations. The state legislature gave its approval for amending various Acts for it.In a letter to the BMC and other local bodies SEC has said finalising reservations for OBCs will take some time. The state government had filed a special leave petition in Supreme Court which directed the state to submit details to the OBC commission. The panel will study data and in turn make recommendations to the state and also to the SEC.“Since taking a decision based on recommendations of the OBC commission will take some time the SEC in the meantime has decided to finalise ward boundaries. It will be the responsibility of the civic body to complete the exercise within the given timeline and the details are to be posted on the corporation’s website and submit a report to the SEC on completion of each step” the SEC letter read.The total population of the city as finalised for the 236 wards is 12.44 million. The SEC has accepted the ward-wise SC and ST population details provided by the BMC. Of the 236 wards 50% are reserved for women. Of the 236 wards 15 wards have been reserved for SCs and two for STs.In March 2021 SC had said reservation for OBCs in state’s local bodies cannot exceed the total ceiling of 50% for SCs STs and OBCs. After the order the state appointed a commission to collect empirical data and promulgated an ordinance to give up to 27% reservation to OBCs without exceeding the 50% ceiling. But SC stayed it saying it cannot be implemented without data. BJP MLA from Mulund Mihir Kotecha said the party will await details of ward boundaries. “It is well known that a political agency affiliated with the ruling party (Shiv Sena) and not BMC has drawn up the ward boundaries. The pen drive submitted to BMC by the agency has been forwarded to the SEC” he said.BJP had won 82 seats in the last civic elections and in over 25 seats it won by a margin of less than 1000 votes. “There is every likelihood booths have been adjusted such that BJP loses its winning edge. Boundaries are decided by arterial roads and major nullahs” said BJP sources.In Thane SEC has okayed 47 multiple panel wards. The ward numbers will go up from 33 to 47. While 46 wards will have 3 members ward No. 44 will have 4. The total representatives will go to 142 from 131.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpuYmMuY28uem0vbmV3cy9hZmNvbi1iYWxsLWdhbWUtd2lubmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AFCON BALL GAME WINNER ~,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.znbc.co.zm', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/afcon-ball-game-winner/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000175F832CA60>, 'Connection to www.znbc.co.zm timed out.

Last year was a memorable year for supply chain finance (SCF) for many reasons. At the start of the pandemic in 2020 buyers began extending membership in their SCF programs to small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) a trend that continued well into 2021.

However last year’s collapse of Greensill Capital brought some unwanted attention to the little-known and opaque world of SCF.

Lex Greensill former head of SCF at Morgan Stanley founded his firm in 2011. The company lasted until March 8 2021 when it filed for insolvency due to one of its primary insurers pulling the plug on credit insurance for the firm’s debt portfolio.

Most SCF is done on a confirmed basis. But in the case of Greensill authorities alleged that the firm was providing financing against future receivables that might or might not have ever materialized which many have described as a form of unsecured lending.

In the wake of Greensill’s collapse the industry expected unwanted regulatory attention to rear its head; however a UK parliamentary report Lessons from Greensill Capital recognized no need to “bring supply chain finance within the regulatory perimeter for financial services.”

Nonetheless Greensill’s example highlights the need for greater transparency in SCF. Much information regarding SCF deals and programs is not readily available. As SCF grows and looks to attract a wider pool of investors and as it supports more-complex financing structures the need also grows for greater transparency to bring more clarity and certainty. This is particularly so for those companies that rely on SCF to ship and supply goods and services without a 60- 90- or 120-day wait for payment.

Transparency is even more critical as SCF becomes a haven for nonbanks and fintechs looking to disrupt the field by leveraging the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain and tokenization—or serving a niche such as SMEs that large global trade banks typically overlook.

Certainly Global Finance’s annual SCF awards reflect the changing mix of providers now entering the SCF market. It is tempting to be dazzled by shiny new pieces of technology and ways of doing business that many new tech-savvy entrants to the field claim they deliver. But it remains critical to keep in mind the need to balance the technology hype against other factors such as a provider’s safety and security reputation and market standing.

It is equally important not to dismiss the innovation and work some of these newer entrants bring. They may not have the track record or experience of firms that have offered SCF for decades. Still they have identified a niche that is not currently well served by the usual SCF providers and can be better addressed with newer technologies and business models.





Although long-standing SCF providers continue to invest in their offerings and want to help clients to digitalize more aspects of their supply chains there is no question that much of this innovation and investment wouldn’t be happening at its current scale or pace without the competitive threat posed by those newer tech-savvy entrants.

This year’s award winners are a mix of the old and the new and a celebration of those that bring not only financing and a pool of investors or even technology’s newest bells and whistles but also a willingness and ability to adapt their services to suit the needs of companies seeking faster and more-affordable forms of financing.

As the SCF market matures many now realize that one size does not fit all and that a wide range of solutions and approaches are needed to address the differing and varied needs of suppliers at every stage or tier of the supply chain.

Among the winners of this year’s Global Finance Best Supply Chain Finance Providers there is a growing recognition that SCF needs to benefit all parts of the supply chain. It’s no longer a special solution for only the largest suppliers in key markets according to Orbian but also provides early liquidity to suppliers in more-vulnerable countries.

Add into the mix a global pandemic that caused significant demand and supply shocks in global supply chains and cash shortfalls for companies that have had to endure months of disruption and lockdowns and we have the kind of perfect storm that allows SCF to flourish and potentially realize its full potential. Despite these recent developments there still exists the trillion-dollar trade financing gap. But a meaningful shift reflected in the achievements of this year’s winners is underway as new solutions enable all tiers of the supply chain to benefit from early payment for goods or services provided.

Methodology: Behind the Rankings

Global Finance editors select the winners for both the Trade Finance Awards and the Supply Chain Finance Awards with input from industry analysts corporate executives and technology experts. The editors also consider entries submitted by financial services providers as well as independent research taking into account a set of objective and subjective factors. This year’s ratings which cover 102 countries and eight regions were based on performance during the period from the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021.

It is not necessary to enter in order to win but experience shows that the additional information supplied in an entry can increase the chance of success. In many cases entrants are able to present details and insights that may not be readily available to the editors of Global Finance.

The winners are those banks and providers that best serve the specialized needs of corporations as they engage in cross-border trade. The winners are not always the biggest institutions but rather the best: those with qualities that companies should consider most carefully when choosing a provider. Global Finance uses a proprietary algorithm with criteria—such as knowledge of local conditions and customer needs financial strength and safety strategic relationships and governance competitive pricing capital investment and innovation in products and services—weighted for relative importance. Each entity is rated on each separate criterion. The algorithm incorporates those ratings into a single numeric score with 100 equivalent to perfection. In cases where more than one institution earns the same score we favor local providers over global institutions and privately-owned over government-owned institutions.

GLOBAL WINNERS

BEST SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROVIDER — BANK

Citi

Winning the global award for Best Supply Chain Finance Provider–Bank is not just about the number of markets served or the number of supply chain finance programs a provider supports. With one of the largest transaction banking networks Citi boasts encouraging metrics on both counts. But more important especially during a pandemic is its ability to scale and implement its services quickly as supply chains adjust to the new business norms.

Liquidity remains a significant portion of any SCF program and Citi’s global reach permits it to source liquidity from its balance sheet or a pool of investors. A noteworthy addition to the bank’s SCF toolbox is its Dynamic Discounting offering which it launched in Europe and the US. The service enables buyers to make cash more readily available to mid- to long-tail suppliers where demand for financing is typically the greatest.

BEST SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROVIDER — NON-BANK

Orbian

Fintechs in SCF come and go but Orbian founded in 1999 by Citi and enterprise-software provider SAP continues its mainstay status. The company focuses on supporting buyer-led SCF programs via innovations such as Express SCF that are designed to make SCF accessible to all suppliers regardless of their size or location.

Alongside its traditional SCF programs which Orbian offers in more than 50 countries Express SCF facilitates early payment in more than 100 countries. The fintech also recently launched a fixed rate offering—an alternative to pricing programs based on Libor or other floating-rate mechanisms—that lets suppliers lock in a rate on any discounts for up to five years. It is 20 years’ worth of collected data permitting better risk modeling that makes such a service possible according to Orbian.

BEST CUSTOMER IMPLEMENTATION

DBS Bank

Leveraging its digital-first strategy and application programming interface (API) suite Singapore-headquartered DBS Bank helped renewable-materials provider Stora Enso monetize its growing accounts receivable portfolio and remove costly inefficient and paper-based processes for managing its incoming receivables. As the company’s days sales outstanding (DSO) had doubled from 60 to 120 days with growing cross-border transactions its finance team were spending more time physically matching invoices and custom and tax declaration forms with their corresponding payments. This gave them little visibility on the status of incoming payments.

Using a combination of DBS Bank’s Supplier Payment Services providing automatic and selective payments for suppliers; its digital supplier onboarding tools; and its DigiDocs offering the bank made the customer journey entirely paperless for Stora Enso. The vendor’s financial team used DBS’ digital corporate banking platform and Swift gpi for cross-border payments to trace incoming payments from buyers in real time.

The bank also set up a digital accounts receivable purchase program to ease the impact that Stora Enso’s widening DSO had on its working capital and to increase its cash conversion cycle so that the company could be paid quicker.

“Teams on both sides worked very well and effectively together to guarantee a smooth process and quick implementation and ramp-up all around” says Wei Li-Tuomela vice president and head of Treasury at Stora Enso.

BEST PROVIDER OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE SOLUTIONS IN SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE

ASYX

Sustainability may be a current buzzword in finance but it does not always easily translate into action for small and midsize enterprises (SMEs). For one thing many systems that track sustainability as goods and services move through global supply chains are often geared for larger companies. The mission of Southeast Asian supply chain integration firm ASYX is to facilitate faster business expansion for SMEs using various forms of supply chain financing and to help them better understand and integrate sustainability into their systems.

With a strong focus on agroindustry and forestry value chains ASYX is well positioned to support sustainable financing initiatives that lead to real change. In Indonesia it supports environmental efforts to preserve rural peatlands and mangroves. In the apparel sector it is helping SMEs that produce natural yarns and fibers in rural areas to scale up their business and become more agile.

BEST BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCING SOLUTION

FQX

Describing itself as “the first market-ready solution for eNotes” which are unconditional promises to pay specific sums to other parties on a selected date FQX combines an old concept with new technology in the form of its Swiss Trust Chain. This is a private blockchain from Swisscom and Swiss Post that incorporates a patent-pending authentication mechanism which FQX says is based on regulated and qualified electronic signatures provided by Swisscom.

FQX’s eNote infrastructure can be integrated into the financing platforms of banks and fintechs “[allowing] for the standardized and globally scalable transfer of unconditional promises to pay radically facilitating supply chain and corporate finance” the vendor adds. For example companies can use eNotes to generate free cash flow improve working-capital metrics and ultimately replace inefficient and costly paper-based trade and supply chain finance processes.

BEST NEW APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE

Vayana Network

With a focus on SMEs India’s Vayana Network leverages plug-and-play APIs data analytics and digital technologies to make it easier for companies of any size to participate in SCF programs.

For one fast-moving consumer-goods vendor assessing researching and servicing an extensive network of distributors proved to be time-consuming and expensive. However using real-time upstream data to identify creditworthy distributors Vayana provided financing offerings that ensured that just as much of the distribution chain would be covered.

Vayana’s platform offered the consumer-goods company a range of financing possibilities beyond standard reverse factoring including receivables securitization and a “specially structured last-mile retailer program.” In addition to its data analytics capabilities being the largest goods and services tax (GST) Suvidha Provider for API-based connections to India’s GST network for tax filing and e-invoicing also has its advantages says Vayana as it allows it to analyze data assess risk onboard partners and disburse and collect money quickly.

BEST DYNAMIC DISCOUNTING SOLUTION

MUFG

Dynamic discounting which enables buyers to use their balance sheets instead of banks provides suppliers with early payment in return for a sizeable discount on their invoices. It is typically dominated by fintechs. Nonetheless Japanese banking giant MUFG which entered US SCF following its 2019 acquisition of GE Capital’s Trade Payables Services platform is one of the few banking providers whose proprietary SCF platform supports standard SCF and dynamic discounting.

For one large US-based customer looking to improve its working-capital metrics across different business units in various countries MUFG proposed a solution that combined a receivables purchase program for its largest suppliers and dynamic discounting for its remaining suppliers. According to the bank the dynamic discounting service delivered a yield of 12% APR and $50 million to $60 million in “realized supplier discounts” or reductions in the cost of goods sold year-on-year. In total the combined program realized more than $1 billion in cash flow benefits according to MUFG.

BEST PLATFORM CONNECTING BUYERS/SELLERS/FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

PrimeRevenue

The Atlanta-based software-as-a-service SCF platform provider PrimeRevenue connects more than 30000 customers in more than 80 countries. Its global funding network includes more than 100 partners and supports more than 30 currencies. The platform’s ability to tap into multiple funding providers has led customers to expand their SCF programs to reap the benefits of better financing availability.

A newly added function SurePay speeds up payments to suppliers by letting buyers consolidate their entire supplier base onto a single payment platform and eliminating the need to manage multiple enterprise resource planning (ERP) and payment systems.

BEST SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

riskmethods

Getting ahead of supplier risk issues that can crop up at any time in complex global supply chains is the holy grail for many companies. But in a business primarily based on a complex web of international relationships building in a certain level of predictability to warn companies how their suppliers could be affected by geopolitical economic or other risks is challenging at the best of times.

However Munich-based riskmethods’ Risk Intelligence engine eliminates much of the guesswork. The engine analyzes millions of data points from media and other sources to identify relevant supply chain threats in real time. Its offering processes more than 2.5 million potentially relevant risk indicators and conducts between 400000 and 500000 risk assessments per month.

How can companies distinguish between what is just noise and what is relevant? The platform’s Noise Cancellation feature alerts users to only the most critical information so that users are not bombarded with false alarms.

REGIONAL WINNERS

AFRICA

Standard Bank

Few banks understand the intricacies of trading in local African markets as well as Standard Bank does. With a heritage of 160 years in the region and a robust sub-Saharan network the bank possesses an in-depth knowledge of local market regulations and customs. Leveraging the strong trading ties between Africa and China Standard Bank was also one of the first African banks to forge a relationship with a Chinese bank namely the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China which acquired a controlling interest in the bank in 2015. Their partnership lets customers in the Africa-China trade corridor benefit from the bank’s structuring and technology expertise. Standard Bank works closely with companies in the oil and gas sector structuring solutions that improve working capital and liquidity metrics while assuming the credit and market risk from receivables purchasing programs. The bank even supports holistic solutions integrating SCF with logistics management.

ASIA-PACIFIC

DBS BANK

Much of DBS’ success in growing its SCF business in the Asia-Pacific region can be attributed to its efforts to be a digital-first bank. This not just about how many markets it is in throughout the region—although that’s important—but also the bank’s expansive API suite. At last count the suite had more than 200 corporate and institutional banking APIs with almost a third of them being trade related. Through APIs the bank can help customers transition to paperless trade more seamlessly by making it easier for the client’s ERP and trade systems to interact with bank systems in real time. Companies can submit documents and financing requests digitally with little or no manual effort resulting in faster processing times and greater visibility across a transaction’s lifecycle.

A digital-first mindset and a comprehensive suite of APIs mean DBS can also partner with fintechs looking to disrupt the trade and supply chain finance industry more readily. Among the fintechs with which the bank has worked are AntChain a blockchain-based trade platform; and CredAble an Indian fintech that provides working-capital finance for SMEs.

CARIBBEAN

Scotiabank

Although Scotiabank has scaled back its presence in the Caribbean and Central America it still operates in 25 countries across the region with strong historical ties to key markets—such as Jamaica where it has supported trade since 1889. The bank has the aspiration to help its customers expand their business wherever they do business “across Canada into the United States the Caribbean and Central and South America” the bank writes in its 2021 annual report. “Our long history across the Americas has given us a deep understanding of how these countries operate the strengths of their economies and the aspirations of the people who live and work there.”

CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE

UniCredit

Instead of a one size fits all approach to SCF UniCredit uses in-house innovation and collaborates with fintechs to develop fully customized working capital offerings to meet the financing needs of its customers in Central and Eastern Europe. In Russia for example the bank devised a digital agent factoring service for accounts payable management to support the entire supply chain for a local manufacturing client. In Slovenia the bank structured a program that benefited buyers and suppliers—the buyers extended their payables while the suppliers received their payments sooner—despite the challenging time frames and an entirely new structure for the bank’s local branch. In addition UniCredit banking teams in different countries—the Czech Republic Germany and Romania—worked together with the help of a fintech to deliver a bespoke SCF offering for an international customer.

LATIN AMERICA

BBVA

The Spanish bank has provided local banking services in Latin America for more than 40 years and its SCF programs encompass core markets such as Mexico Peru and Colombia. In 2020 the region accounted for more than half of the bank’s overall profits. Moreover the region is of even greater value to the bank following the recent divestment of its US retail banking operations according to analysts. The bank has based the bulk of its SCF programs in Mexico and Peru where BBVA boasts a more than 20% market share. In 2020 BBVA launched its new cloud-based global SCF platform which provides a single point of access and full traceability of all invoices and payments. The platform supports payments in local currency in Mexico Peru and Colombia. In addition BBVA plans to roll out support for the Argentinian market later this year.

MIDDLE EAST

First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB)

As the largest banking group by assets in the UAE First Abu Dhabi Bank is one of the first banks in the Middle East to develop a fully automated SCF offering which is in production with several international customers and programs. Throughout 2021 the bank implemented various SCF programs collaborating with government agencies to support SMEs. It partnered with the Department of Finance in Abu Dhabi and health insurer Daman to provide a 6 billion dirham ($1.6 billion) SCF program to ensure rapid payment of receivables for SMEs in the health care sector. Other noteworthy deals include an Islamic SCF program that supports suppliers in the UAE and acting as co-lead arranger on a program supporting SME suppliers and corporates for one of the major members of the Gulf Cooperation Council.

NORTH AMERICA

Bank of America

With solid growth in its SCF portfolio in 2020 Bank of America witnessed continued growth throughout 2021. The North American corporate banking giant which invests billions in technology annually looks to compete with innovative fintechs in SCF by investing in APIs and data analytics to deliver greater operational efficiencies and insights to its clients and their suppliers. For example the bank now provides real-time payment status information directly to buyers’ ERP systems via APIs. Its Supplier Enablement Portal which the bank rolled out to North American customers in 2020 uses data analytics to analyze buyers’ spending with suppliers aiding supplier segmentation and prioritization of strategic suppliers for onboarding to buyer-led financing programs.

WESTERN EUROPE

BBVA

BBVA’s global SCF platform which it launched in 2020 enables customers to pay suppliers in up to 20 currencies. The new cloud-based platform is designed to make it easier for the bank to onboard the entire supplier base of creditworthy buyers without imposing any limits on the number of invoices or amount of financing. Buyers can also more easily track invoices and payments to suppliers. Given that its biggest markets are based in its European stronghold—where the bank is headquartered—and in South America the bank is geographically diversified enough to meet its European customers’ local or global SCF needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFpbWVjYXRtdWxsLzIwMjIvMDEvMjkvNi13b21lbi1jaGFuZ2luZy10aGUtZmFjZS1vZi1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWluLWJhbmtpbmctYW5kLWZpbmFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Women Changing The Face Of Leadership In Banking And Finance,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaimecatmull/2022/01/29/6-women-changing-the-face-of-leadership-in-banking-and-finance/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFpbWVjYXRtdWxsLzIwMjIvMDEvMjkvNi13b21lbi1jaGFuZ2luZy10aGUtZmFjZS1vZi1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWluLWJhbmtpbmctYW5kLWZpbmFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpYmVyYXRpb25uZXdzLm9yZy9rYXJhbmthd2EtbmF0aW9uLXByb3Rlc3RzLWRhbmdlcm91cy1waXBlbGluZS1leHBhbnNpb24taW50by1zYWNyZWQtbGFuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Karankawa nation protests dangerous pipeline expansion into sacred land – Liberation News,"On Jan. 22 members of the Karankawa nation and several hundred supporters gathered in front of a Bank of America location in Austin Texas. Protesters spoke out against the planned expansion of an oil pier owned and operated by Canada-based oil giant Enbridge. The expansion would cross sacred Karankawa land at a Karankawa village site near Corpus Christi Bay in south Texas. Pipeline construction would also endanger sacred burial artifacts and have a disastrous effect on the sensitive and biodiverse wet marshes.

Chiara a Karankawa organizer gave an impassioned speech defending the environment of her people’s homeland and called out Bank of America for financing fossil fuel extraction. Bank of America invested $42 billion in fossil fuels in 2020 alone. Since the signing of the Paris Climate Accords in 2015 the world’s 60 largest banks have invested $3.8 trillion in fossil fuels.

In an Instagram video prior to the event Chiara stated: “We are going to call for the cancellation of Enbridge on top of the Karankawa settlement. But since we are not the only Indigenous group that is affected by Enbridge we’re also calling for more notice that this is happening to the Indigenous community. We’re asking people to stop with fossil fuels. … We are calling for Indigenous rights and sovereignty. We are calling for the restructuring of this awful system that we have going on right now where you are mining your spirit and the world of her ‘resources’ — to do what? To take away a part of our history?”

Enbridge has an abysmal track record on the environment. The company is notorious for its Line 3 which has spilled several times most recently last year. On March 3 1991 Line 3 ruptured and spilled 1.7 million gallons of oil into a wetland near Grand Rapids Minnesota which then spilled into the Prairie River. The pipeline was reconstructed in 2020 despite widespread protest from Indigenous tribes and supporters and despite pending appeals in court. In January 2021 Line 3 construction punctured an aquifer in northwestern Minnesota unleashing an “uncontrolled flow of groundwater” that took Enbridge an entire year to fix.

U.S. police are playing a key role in defending dangerous fossil fuel extraction against Indigenous people. In Minnesota Enbridge is effectively paying police to guard Line 3 and harass water protectors through a fund set up by the state’s Public Utilities Commission. “They’re pouring large sums of money into local sheriff’s departments who can then tap the funds for any use that’s related to the pipelines” said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard a lawyer with the Center for Protest Law and Litigation. “It incentivizes them to take action against peaceful opponents of the pipeline.”

Despite the challenges the Karankawa are fighting back. Recognition of Indigenous lands and solidarity with Indigenous peoples is indispensable to the fight against climate change and environmental destruction. Stand with the Karankawa against fossil fuel extraction! No Enbridge expansion! More info on the struggles and how to take action can be found at stopenbridge.com and karankawas.com.

Global trade has been rocked by seismic changes to supply chains and subdued economic outputs over the course of the Covid pandemic; but increased innovation and digitalization of trade finance has ensured that businesses can still operate and provide a more sustainable future with greater transparency which bodes well for a new trade finance ecosystem.

Trade finance is playing an increasingly crucial role in supporting companies’ efforts in meeting environmental social and governance (ESG) targets and opportunities be it from paperless processes or green financing; and these are being enabled by the digital efforts of both banks and technology companies.

According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) the global trade finance gap hit an all-time high of $1.7 trillion due to Covid—with small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) hardest hit accounting for 40% of rejected trade finance requests. ADB highlights the role of digitalization in streamlining onboarding processes for SMEs and opening new sources of liquidity. Digital innovation can make the entire trade ecosystem more efficient more inclusive and less costly. The pandemic has brought additional urgency to the need to solve the hurdles hindering fragile supply chains and the financing of trade.

For banks digitalization offers a reduction in operating costs and more accurate records of transactions which can be used to provide trade insights. It also provides more reliable and instant know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks which can cut compliance costs.

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret scanned documents and check them against a set of predefined rules and regulations allows banks to focus on the anomalies highlighted by AI rather than spend their time on labor-intensive reading of documents manually and other repetitive tasks that take up much of their time. Benefits are not limited to banks. All parties across trade transactions benefit from reduced costs greater fraud mitigation and the optimization of working capital.

The use of optical character recognition (OCR) machine learning and neural language processing significantly lowers errors in trade-related documentation while the consolidation of digital trade documentation into a single electronic file brings further efficiencies to the multiple parties in various jurisdictions including trading partners financial institutions credit insurers shipping companies customs and other services providers.

The digital ledger of transactions created on a blockchain provides trade participants with all the necessary trade information in one digital document. Blockchain also creates the means to perform sustainability screening and verification which could help scale up the delivery of green trade finance and sustainability-linked trade finance deals such as the one announced between HSBC and clothing company Epic Group which ties pricing to ESG targets including greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater use intensity.

While the world was forced to close borders and become more insular interoperability between players and platforms has offered a way forward for all participants in trade finance where cooperation promises a more inclusive and less fragmented approach to trade.

Last year the World Bank said that to fully reap the benefits of new technologies the entire trade ecosystem—banks regulators border agencies trade bodies and corporates—must work together to apply digital innovation and drive efficiencies. This collaborative approach will help drive the future of trade finance and help meet substantiality objectives.

Farmer Joe was enticed to take a bath with Claire both of whom developed a connection with each other during their first 24-hour date together.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9maWxtcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA0L2thdGUtd2luc2xldC1zdGFycy13YXItcGhvdG9ncmFwaGVyLXdhc2hlZC1oaXRsZXJzLWJhdGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kate Winslet stars as war photographer who washed in Hitler's bath,"Looking every inch the battle-hardened foreign correspondent this is Kate Winslet as World War Two photographer Lee Miller.

Warren Buffett explained how asset bubbles form shared the key attribute he looks for in businesses and warned against using leverage in an interview with the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010.

The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO also outlined the difference between speculating and long-term investing and praised the Federal Reserve and Treasury for rapidly shoring up the financial system after Lehman Brothers collapsed.

Here are Buffett's 10 best quotes from the interview edited for length and clarity:

1. ""The single-most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power. If you've got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor you've got a very good business. And if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by a tenth of a cent then you've got a terrible business. I've been in both and I know the difference.""

2. ""When a management with a reputation for brilliance gets hooked up with a business with a reputation for bad economics it's the reputation of the business that remains intact.""

3. ""When I buy a stock I don't care if they close the stock market tomorrow for a couple of years because I'm looking to the business Coca-Cola or whatever it may be to produce returns for me in the future. Now if I care whether the stock market is open tomorrow then to some extent I'm speculating because I'm thinking about whether the price is going to go up tomorrow or not.""

4. ""The nature of Wall Street is that overall it makes a lot of money relative to the number of people involved relative to the IQ of the people involved and relative to the energy expended.""

5. ""If you don't have leverage you don't get in trouble. That's the only way a smart person can go broke basically. And I've always said 'If you're smart you don't need it; and if you're dumb you shouldn't be using it.'""

6. ""When people are getting paid $200000 to $300000 a year to be on a board and they're hoping to get put on some other board so they get another $200000 or $300000 a year they are not exactly going to be Doberman Pinschers in terms of policing things.""

7. ""The public might not understand stocks they might not understand tulip bulbs but they understood houses. They wanted to buy one and with the financing you could leverage up to the sky. It created a bubble like we've never seen."" (Buffett added that bubbles form when people buy into a sound premise such as 'house prices rise over time' or 'stocks outperform bonds' but that premise becomes distorted and they end up focusing solely on price action.)

8. ""The media investors the mortgage bankers the American public me my neighbor rating agencies Congress — you name it — people overwhelmingly came to believe that house prices could not fall significantly. And since it was the biggest asset class in the country and it was the easiest class to borrow against it created probably the biggest bubble in our history.""

9. ""There is seldom just one cockroach in the kitchen. You turn on the light and all of sudden they all start scurrying around. I couldn't find the light switch but I had seen one. (He was reflecting on his concerns about Freddie Mac arbitraging government credit.)

10. ""The Treasury and the Fed remedied that very quickly by taking action. It was economic Pearl Harbor and we sent out the fleet the next day. But we had the ships in the harbor unfortunately on the day Lehman failed."" (Buffett was saying that authorities swiftly assuaged doubts about whether they would intervene to prevent the banking system from collapsing.)

The publication says that in recent months a Minnesota delivery worker and a Los Angeles salesperson for the company filed lawsuits seeking class action status against it over unpaid overtime. Aside from unpaid labor the LA salesperson which worked at Peloton for over five years also said he wasn't reimbursed for work expenses and wasn't paid the full wages required upon termination of employment.

BuzzFeed also talked to three more workers who raised various kinds of pay issues. They complained about having to go back to work after clocking out and not being paid for it having to work through breaks and not getting expense reimbursements. One worker said there were multiple instances wherein he showed up to work and there was nothing to do. While Peloton told BuzzFeed that it pays workers for ""a minimum of four hours"" of work the person the publication interviewed said he was sent home without pay.

Peloton exploded in popularity at the beginning of the pandemic when gyms were closed and people wanted an exercise machine in their homes. As BuzzFeed News notes employees at its New York City HQ thought it was the best place to work but it was the company's sales/video production staff assembly workers and delivery drivers that raised concerns about missing pay.

A Peloton spokesperson however told BuzzFeed that it provides paid break time as per labor laws. The spokesperson also said: ""We are committed to creating an inclusive kind and productive culture where all team members are treated respectfully and have the tools to succeed. Peloton employees are fairly paid and we are committed to adhering to all legal requirements in every state in which we operate.""

According to a CNBC report earlier this month Peloton is experiencing a significant drop in demand due to several factors such as increased competition from rivals. The report claimed that the company is pausing Bike and Tread production as a result but Peloton CEO John Foley denied that in a letter to employees. He said that rumors the company is halting the production of its exercise machines are false but he did say that Peloton is ""resetting [its] production levels for sustainable growth."" He also said that while layoffs are the last resort as a solution to its its problems Peloton now needs to ""evaluate [its] organization structure and size of [its] team.""

Would he if he were poor?,"EDITOR: I recently read the article regarding the 49ers using Bay Port’s field for practice (""How the NFL's San Francisco 49ers ended up at Bay Port High School and the viral moment that came from it"" Scott Venci).

As a Bay Port alumni and father I was disappointed to read Nick Bosa using the field as his personal latrine.

His actions were viewed by many underaged children given the social media posts and was also in the vicinity of an elementary school. I understand this action did not cause unimaginable harm to the kids who witnessed it; in fact I bet it was a source of excitement and hilarity. However what disappoints me is the lack of action taken by security/law enforcement.

We all know if this were a homeless veteran or any other non-famous working-class American campus security and local police would have reacted instantly and without question. That veteran/working-class American might have been arrested for indecent exposure (Class A misdemeanor) charged fined and could be placed on a sex offenders list if prosecutors had evidence that he exposed himself.

San Francisco 49ers players stand on the Bay Port High School football field on Jan. 21 the day before their NFC divisional playoff victory over the Green Bay Packers. No. 97 Nick Bosa can be seen in the background.

However due to Nick Bosa’s status and money he becomes a headline with no real consequences. This inequity in which the law is strictly adhered to when judging lower/working-class Americans and blatantly flippantly disregarded when reacting to the illegal actions of the rich and famous is disenchanting.

This is just a small but profound example of the systemic injustice seen in our judicial system.

Getting a mere $1000 donation from a billion-dollar franchise to have a millionaire piss on our field in view of our children with no consequences: What a deal but not for us.

Six people were charged on Friday in connection to the crime spree.

The Ramsey County Attorney's Office filed felony theft charges against four adults: Nathaniel Spears Na'touri Ross Shaimee Robinson-Love and Ra'Lasia Wright. Two 17-year-olds have been petitioned via summons for one count of felony theft. A felony theft charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years if the individual is convicted.

Officials say that more people are suspected of taking part in the crime spree but they could not be clearly identified.

The criminal complaint says that a group of about 16 people struck the Best Buy in Burnsville around 5 p.m. the one in Maplewood around 6 p.m. and one in Blaine around 8 p.m. Roughly $26000 worth of products was stolen from the Best Buy stores in what officials called at the time a ""very organized"" retail theft.

A Richfield Dick's Sporting Goods was also hit on the same day. By the time police were at each scene on Black Friday the group had already left.

NEW: Charges have been filed against several individuals involved in mass theft incidents on Black Friday.

The criminal complaint states that officers received an anonymous tip that Wright ran a Facebook page called ""Run Outs by Ralai"" and had bragged about the thefts. The tipster said Wright had showed TVs laptops and hoverboards on Facebook Live.

The tipster provided Wright's address on Dupont Avenue in Minneapolis and when officers arrived they saw a Ford Edge with Florida license plates in the driveway. The complaint states that the car was involved in the thefts and it was towed.

Wright came out while the car was being towed and she admitted that she was at the scene of the thefts but denied personally stealing anything. She denied being a ringleader and said people had met at a gas station and decided to do the thefts together.

Officers executed a search warrant on the car and found an anti-theft device inside.

""This brazen act by an organized group shocked those who witnessed it first-hand as well as the retail community and law-abiding shoppers who were out making purchases ahead of the busy holiday season"" said Ramsey County Attorney John Choi. ""Bringing these individuals to justice sends a message that this type of activity will not be tolerated. Our thanks go out to our partners in law enforcement for their hard work in unraveling this complex investigation.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25ld3MubmV0L25ld3MvcGFpci1vZi1idXNpbmVzc2VzLWNvbWluZy10by1raW5nc3BvcnQtcGF2aWxpb24tc2hvcHBpbmctY2VudGVyL2FydGljbGVfMGEyNDQwNTItODA3Yi0xMWVjLTlhN2QtY2Y3MTc0MWQ3ZDlhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pair of businesses coming to Kingsport Pavilion Shopping Center,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The fact that KEF’s new KC62 subwoofer uses a force-cancelling driver array is not new or even news because dozens of subwoofers use force-cancelling driver arrays. But it is true that it was once news – big news – because KEF was the first company in the world to build a commercial loudspeaker that employed force-cancelling drivers – the KEF Reference 104/2 way back in 1984.

What is totally new about the new KC62 – and also very newsworthy! – is that KEF has built a completely different kind of bass driver that has force-cancelling as an integral part of its mode of operation. So whereas all other manufacturers use two separate drivers to achieve the force-cancelling function (as did KEF in 1984 with the 104/2 and in 2010 with the KC92) KEF delivers force-cancelling in this new KC62 using just a single driver and a system it calls ‘Uni-Core.’

To the best of my knowledge such a driver has never been built before: it’s completely new and totally different.

Uni-core bass driverKEF’s Uni-Core driver is an amazing device. Although it’s a single unit with just one magnet and chassis it has two voice-coils and two cones. Since this might be difficult to conceptualise (since to the best of my knowledge this is the first time such a construction has ever been realised) readers would be best advised to look at Figure 1 below which shows a cross-sectional view.

(Image credit: KEF)

This cut-away view clearly shows that the two voice-coils one with a greater diameter than the other are arranged concentrically so the smaller one operates within the larger one and means that the voice coils are able to travel within their own gap(s) without colliding.

Obviously this means that the two voice coils must be different and the magnetic fields in which they operate must also be different yet in order for the force-cancelling to work and for the acoustic output of the two cones to be identical a great many electrical and magnetic parameters must have been manipulated in order to ensure this works as it should.

I must admit to being rather amazed that the Uni-Core driver works at all or even that it was possible to FEA model the driver’s behaviour prior to building the first prototype. The primary issue is that that the magnetic field created in one voice coil by the alternating current flowing through it which causes it to move in the fixed field created by the permanent magnet would also affect the magnetic field of the other voice coil and vice versa – and my initial thought that it would probably do this adversely.

KEF’s engineers obviously realised this straight away and I suspect this is one of the main reasons a very comprehensive ‘White Paper’ has been posted on the company’s website that explains the operation of the driver. It turns out that KEF says it has eliminated interaction between the two coils by placing a large aluminium cylinder between them that acts as a low-resistance shorted-turn.

Not only this but the cylinder apparently also dramatically drops the total inductance of the Uni-Core driver as well as reduces variations in inductance caused by the physical location(s) of the coil(s) in the fixed magnetic field compared with a geometry where two completely separate drivers are used (as in for example the KEF KC92.)

This quite amazingly beneficial outcome is shown graphically in KEF’s White Paper so I have included that graph below so you can be as amazed by it as I was.

(Image credit: KEF)

The graph above shows a completely unexpected result but I guess that’s magnetism for you – it’s a strange force that in order to totally understand you need to have a very good grasp on the principles of quantum mechanics.

And although things have progressed somewhat since Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman said: “If you think you understand quantum mechanics then you don’t” I am still going with what Neils Bohr (also a Nobel prize-winning physicist) said which is: “Anyone not shocked by quantum mechanics has not yet understood it.”

KEF’s White Paper also includes mention of Hofmann’s ‘Iron Law’ which is so important in the context of subwoofer design that I would like to discuss it in some detail but if you’re not interested in the physics feel free to skip the following section and move on to the heading ‘Construction.’

Hofmann’s iron law

All subwoofers have to conform to Hofmann’s Iron Law and the KEF KC62 is no exception however KEF’s White Paper states that “Iron Laws cannot be broken but they can certainly be bent.” So I guess we should take a look at Hofmann’s Iron Law and how it applies to the KC62!

Hofmann’s so-called ‘law’ of low frequency reproduction was coined by Joseph Anton Hofmann who was one of the three founders of KLH Loudspeakers a company that in its hey-day was the largest loudspeaker manufacturer in the world.

In fact the first letter of Hoffman’s surname is the ‘H’ in KLH. The other two initials were contributed by Henry Kloss (who helped found Acoustic Research before KLH and later founded Advent) and Malcolm Scollay Low (who had also helped found Acoustic Research and after leaving KLH would go on to found Evans and Sutherland Computer Corporation and become a pioneer in digital recording and computer graphics.)

(Image credit: Anton Hoffman)

It’s important to use Hofmann’s middle name because his father was none other than Josef Casimir Hofmann one of the greatest pianists who has ever lived. And if that sentence made you stop in your tracks consider that no less a pianist (and composer) than Sergei Rachmaninoff said Hofmann was the ‘greatest pianist alive’ Ralph Berkowitz said he “had the greatest technique of any pianist” he’d ever heard and Anton Rubinstein thought that Hofmann was such “an unprecedented talent” that he took him on as a student – the only pianist he would ever teach.

On the merely ‘technical’ side Josef Casimir Hofmann was also one of the first pianists ever to be recorded (on an Edison cylinder) and was also a prolific inventor with more than 70 patents to his name including patents for pneumatic shock absorbers for cars and airplanes windscreen wipers and a device to record dynamics in reproducing piano rolls (unfortunately invented just as piano roll companies went out of business). He also patented improvements to piano actions that were later incorporated into Steinway pianos.

His son Joseph Anton Hofmann’s “Iron Law” essentially states that three important attributes of any loudspeaker system are inextricably linked: low-bass reproduction enclosure size and sensitivity (efficiency) in such a way that it is impossible for a single design to satisfactorily deliver all three.

He said that optimising any two of these attributes would inevitably compromise the one that remained. “A designer who wants good deep low-frequency sound and high sensitivity can obtain these goals but they will have to use a large speaker enclosure” he said. “Similarly if a designer is forced by space constraints to use a very small cabinet and they aim to get good deep low-frequency sound sensitivity will inevitably be compromised.”

It’s really a variation of an old business adage one that’s so well-known you’ve probably seen it on a sign in a business in your neighbourhood: “We offer three kinds of service: Good – Cheap – Fast. You can pick any two.” Meaning that if it’s fast and good it won’t be cheap. If it’s fast and cheap it won’t be good. And of course if it’s good and cheap it won’t be fast.

If you studied project management at college you probably learned these principles as the ‘triple constraints’ of any project: time cost and its scope or quality.

Of the three variables in Hofmann’s Iron Law the one that’s the hardest to bend is the one that involves ‘good deep low-frequency sound.’ This is because of a very basic law of physics which states that if a bass driver can produce a sound pressure level of 90dBSPL at a frequency of 50Hz by moving back and forwards a particular distance (say x) then for that same driver to produce 90dBSPL at 25Hz the cone would need to move backwards and forwards a distance of 4x.

That is when the frequency is halved cone excursion must be increased FOUR times (not two as you might have guessed).

The factor of 4 comes about because sound pressure is a result of a cone’s acceleration. So it’s the rate of change of its velocity. The rate of change of a sine wave increases with its frequency: the faster it oscillates the more change. So the rate of change of excursion (i.e. velocity) increases with frequency of oscillation. Half the frequency also halves the rate of change. Acceleration is the rate of change of rate of change hence the factor of 4.

The problem for a typical cone speaker is that a good Xmax for a high-quality bass driver would be about 10mm. So if it were using this Xmax to deliver a 50Hz signal at say 90dBSPL it would need to travel 40mm in order to deliver exactly the same SPL at 25Hz. Clearly impossible.

If on the other hand you decide to use the driver’s Xmax to deliver a signal at 25Hz this means that in order for the response to be flat down to this frequency the cone will only move 2.5mm at 50Hz. This won’t be very loud at all. So you can get flat response between 50Hz and 25Hz but only if you accept that undistorted sound pressure levels will be compromised.

So in the words of KEF’s White Paper: “When designing a small subwoofer the choice has to be made between high efficiency and low frequency extension. Both are very desirable features for a subwoofer. To create a subwoofer that can deliver the maximum performance for the minimum of space KEF R&D worked to push the compromises as far as possible. After all Iron Laws cannot be broken but they can certainly be bent.”

Construction

The surround of the Uni-Core driver is a new one for KEF which it calls ‘P-Flex.’ It was invented to solve a problem that affects all small subwoofers with sealed enclosures. And that’s the same problem no matter how many drivers might be fitted to the enclosure. That problem is that whenever the driver cone(s) moves ‘inwards’ the air pressure inside the cabinet will increase. Whenever it moves ‘outwards’ the air pressure inside the cabinet will decrease. Either way the air pressure in the listening room will remain a constant.

The problem here is that the natural way of things is that nature would prefer it if the air inside the cabinet were at the same pressure as the air in the room so it will attempt to equalise the two pressures. It can’t do this because the cabinet is sealed so it will look for the ‘weakest link’ in the cabinet which is the roll surround and therefore will exert considerable pressure on this surround with the result that the surround will deform and no longer act in a linear manner.

In the past the solution to this problem has been to increase the thickness of the surround to make it so strong it cannot buckle under the pressure generated but this has two problems. The first is that the thicker the surround the more energy needs to be exerted by the magnet/voice-coil in order to make the cone move which reduces overall efficiency. The second problem is that the increase in the stiffness of the surround reduces the low-frequency response of the driver which is the exact opposite of what you want to happen in a subwoofer.

KEF’s ‘P-Flex’ surround for which the company has applied for a patent has ‘pleats’ in the roll that to use the exact wording in KEF’s ‘White Paper’ “resist the deformation caused by the changing internal air pressure of the cabinet whilst allowing extended linear movement of the driver without the issue of buckling at higher excursion.”

Interestingly surround technology is going through something of a renaissance at the moment possibly because of improvements in materials moulding technologies and the increased use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in loudspeaker development so many different manufacturers are releasing drivers with unique surround profiles.

KEF’s P-Flex is as exciting a development as Purifi’s ‘Neutral Surround’ surround material whose effective radiation area remains constant throughout the entire voice coil excursion. (Which solves the problem that affects traditional half-roll surrounds which is that the radiation area decreases during ‘inward’ cone movement and increases during ‘outward’ cone movement.)

Interestingly two of the inventors of the ‘Neutral Surround’ – Lars Risbo and Bruno Putzeys – are referenced in KEF’s ‘White Paper’ but not in relation to the P-Flex surround but instead to a paper they co-authored titled ‘Force Factor Modulation in ElectroDynamic Loudspeakers’ which was presented at the 141st meeting of the Audio Engineering Society Convention.

The fit ‘n finish of the control/connection plate fitted to the rear of the KEF KC62 is astoundingly good. It simply oozes quality. At the very top of the plate is an ‘Expansion Port’ that allows customers to add features they might like by plugging in optional devices.

The first of these to become available was the ability to send audio signals to the KEF KC62 wirelessly which is made possible only by means of purchasing a separately available wireless kit (KW-1). This kit also allows you to interface the KC62 with other compatible KEF products such as powered speakers… although you can already do this as we will discover later in this review.

Immediately alongside this Expansion Port is a vertically-arrayed set of four DIP switches (DIP stands for “dual in-line package”) that are used to set the filter characteristics for the line output terminals of the KC62 (the terminals are located at the bottom right of the control/connection plate).

The available turnover frequencies for this filter are 40Hz 45Hz 50Hz 55Hz 60Hz 70Hz 80Hz 90Hz 100Hz 110Hz and 120Hz. You can also use certain of the DIP switch settings to force the output to be mono rather than its default of stereo.

To the right of the DIP switch is a simple two-position slider switch for phase (0° or 180°) and to the right of this is a five position ‘EQ’ slider switch with positions (from top to bottom) for ‘Room’ ‘Wall’ ‘Corner’ ‘Cabinet’ and ‘Apartment’.

(Image credit: KEF)

The reason for KEF including an Equalisation switch is that a subwoofer’s output volume is affected more dramatically by where it is positioned in your room relative to the walls floor and ceiling than any other type of loudspeaker due to the wavelength of the frequencies it’s reproducing being longer than those of ordinary loudspeakers.

(The lower the frequency of any sound the longer the wavelength. A 170Hz sound has a wavelength of two metres while a 17Hz sound has a wavelength of 20 metres.) KEF’s EQ settings allow you to adjust its output to ensure the KC62 will deliver its best performance no matter where in the room you end up putting it… even if you put it inside a cabinet.

But while the Room Wall Corner and Cabinet modes are self-explanatory what about that ‘Apartment’ mode? What’s this for? Glad you asked…

Because of their long wavelength low frequencies are far better at travelling through walls than higher frequencies which tend to be reflected from hard surfaces so if you live in a home unit or a flat or an apartment (and in the same manner as quantum physics it must be said that only real estate agents know the difference between these three types of dwelling!) there’s an excellent chance that your neighbours will be also be enjoying (or not!) the low-frequency sounds made by your subwoofer even more loudly than you are in your own apartment.

So if you are using the KEF KC62 in an apartment setting its EQ switch to ‘Apartment’ mode will increasingly reduce the volume level of low frequencies as they get lower in frequency starting at 40Hz. So the further the frequencies fall below 40Hz the more the KC62 will reduce their level.

Of course this won’t only reduce the chance of your neighbours hearing these frequencies – it will also reduce the volume levels in your own room so that you may not be able to hear them as well either. So although such a switch might obviously be very useful at maintaining neighbourhood harmony it does seem to defeat the reason for buying a subwoofer in the first place!

To the right of the Mode switch is another two-position slider switch with the upper position labelled ‘Manual’ and the lower position ‘LFE’. When this is set to ‘Manual’ the rotary ‘Crossover’ control to its right becomes active and allows you to set the high-frequency roll-off to best-suit your main speakers. It’s a rotary control with calibrated positions at 10Hz intervals from 40Hz up to 100Hz after which there’s one calibration at 125Hz and a final one at 150Hz.

When the ‘Mode’ switch control is set to its LFE (Low Frequency Effects) lower position the ‘Crossover’ control is disabled so that the highest frequency the CD62 is able to deliver is instead controlled by your AV receiver’s LFE output. Since this is effectively a ‘Bypass’ circuit if your AV receiver doesn’t filter its LFE output the KC62 will operate ‘full range.’

The KEF KC62 has both speaker level (high) and line-level inputs but the speaker-level inputs are not the usual large multi-way binding posts. KEF has instead provided a custom four-pin plug to which you connect your speaker wires and it’s this plug which then connects to the small rectangular socket on the control/connection plate.

This makes for a very neat installation but does rather limit you to using speaker wire diameters that will actually fit into the connector. So you may instead prefer to connect the KC62 using the line-level inputs which are provided in the form of two standard gold-plated RCA terminals the left-most of which is for LFE connection and is so labelled. The right most RCA terminal is labelled ‘Smart Connect’. For connection to a preamp or similar you’d use both terminals.

(Image credit: KEF)

To the right of the LFE/Smart-Connect inputs is the pair of line-level outputs I mentioned earlier in this review. These can be set so the audio signals that appear there are simply a ‘loop-through’ from the line-level inputs or you can route the audio signals through a high-pass filter (set by the DIP switch) to remove low frequencies before they appear at this output.

The main power switch is obviously wired to make sense to owners in the USA because pressing the top of it inwards switches the subwoofer on (the exactly opposite of mains power switch operation here in Australia and in the UK). There’s a small tell-tale dual-colour LED above the switch that glows red when the subwoofer is off but power is available and green when it’s operational.

The KEF KC62 is available in one or the other of two colours – ‘carbon black’ and ‘mineral white’. Either way it will weigh 14kg which is amazingly heavy when you consider how tiny it is at just 246×256×248mm. That’s barely bigger than the proverbial shoe-box!

Power and distortion

The KC62 has two Class-D amplifiers inside – one amplifier for each voice-coil – with each amplifier rated at 500-watts for a total power of 1000-watts! A great deal of this power is used just getting the cones to move because since the KC62 enclosure is sealed and has a volume of only a few litres a great deal energy is expended simply forcing the driver cones to move and alternately compress and rarefy the air inside the enclosure.

However despite this the 1000-watts on tap is still more than sufficient power to push the cones beyond their most linear excursion point at which point distortion would increase considerably.

To prevent this from happening KEF includes its so-called ‘Smart Distortion Control Technology (SDCT) in the KC62’s circuitry to make sure the cones do not go beyond this point. Rather than use a physical sensor to monitor cone excursion KEF instead uses a current sensor to directly and instantaneously monitor the current flowing in the voice coil. When the current being drawn indicates that distortion has increased drive voltage to the voice-coil is instantly reduced. But KEF’s SDCT circuit is not only reactive it is also proactive.

KEF uses a digital signal processor to modify the audio signal delivered to the driver to ‘pre-compensate’ for known limitations of the Uni-Core driver’s operational parameters effectively ‘pre-correcting’ for distortion that would otherwise be introduced by the driver (some of which could be a function of the geometry of the unique driver itself as discussed previously).

The DSP circuitry works in concert with the current-sensing circuitry in such a way that KEF claims the combination of these technologies reduces THD by up to 75 per cent (below 50Hz).

Listening sessions

Despite the welcome inclusion of equalisation circuitry to compensate for room position you will still get best performance if you position the KEF in the place in your room where it is the best acoustic match with your room. (Which is true of all subwoofers but becomes increasingly important as the subwoofer gets smaller in size.)

To establish the best position place the KC62 where your head would be when you’re listening to your system (which is particularly easy to do since it’s so small!) and then when using some music with deep bass on an A–B loop crawl around your room. At some points you’ll hear quite loud bass and at other points you’ll hear very little bass at all.

Pick one of the points where the bass was loud and put the KC62 there. After that set the EQ switch to the setting that best reflects this location or using the same A–B bass loop sit in your listening position and have someone else switch through the different EQ settings and choose the one whose balance you most prefer.

I started my sessions with the KC62 with one of my favourite albums obviously because of the music but mostly because of the lovely walking bass lines from which the album (Quincy Jones’ ‘Walking in Space’) does not actually take its name.

(Image credit: Quincy Jones)

Right from the very first track Dead End I could hear the KEF ‘doin’ its stuff’ and really fleshing out the Ray Brown’s double-bass. That ‘distortion’ you can hear at the end is not the KEF by the way it’s recorded.

The KEF continued to impress with the title track plus there’s the kick drum sound as well. The justifiably famous Killer Joe let the KC62 shine too but it’s Love and Peace that perhaps showed its talents to the greatest degree as well as demonstrating how well the subwoofer integrates with the main speakers – there’s really no confusion at all at the point of acoustic crossover.

If you’d like to hear the KC62 perform with electric bass you won’t have a better demo track than Whole Lotta Love from Led Zeppelin II with John Paul Jones on the fret board and John Bonham on drums. The truly great bass riff and the insane drumming were delivered marvellously well by the KEF KC62.

(Image credit: Michael Jackson)

I checked the speed of the KEF KC62’s bass with Michael Jackson’s Wanna Be Starting Something the opener on his fantastic album ‘Thriller’. The video clip for the title track is still one of my all-time favourite clips. (Actually thinking about it I think it is the best I’ve ever seen). This would be a good track for your crawl-around by the way.

The KEF was impressively fast – didn’t miss a trick actually. I wasn’t sure if the KC62 could deliver the subterranean deep bass FX on Beat It but it proved it could… as well as the authentic instrumental bass lines. All this great performance comes with one proviso which is that it’s most impressive at lower listening levels and becomes less so as you wind up the volume. The KEF KC62 is certainly great at producing a rabbit out of the hat but not a kangaroo! Equally its bass is more impressive in small to average-sized rooms than it is in larger ones.

Verdict

One aspect of the KC62’s performance that KEF’s ‘White Paper’ does not mention when it’s talking about ‘Iron Laws’ is that ‘bending laws’ costs money! And the additional costs involved in doing that are considerable and clearly evidenced in the build quality required in order to enable the KC62 to deliver the high levels of performance that it does.

For example the KEF KC62 has to have an expensive aluminium cabinet to withstand the high pressures involved rather than an inexpensive wooden one. It also has to have two enormously powerful amplifiers inside rather than a single less powerful one.

It also has to have an extremely complex very difficult-to-build ‘Uni-Core’ driver inside rather than two ordinary drivers. Plus it needs to have unique and complex ‘Smart Distortion Control Technology’ built-in in order to control the motion of that expensive Uni-Core driver whereas many subwoofers have no ‘smart’ technology built-in to them at all.

All of which means that in the end someone has to pick up the tab for ‘bending the laws’ in order to deliver the bass you’ll hear from a KEF KC62. But if you want this level of performance from subwoofer of the KC62’s size you really have no other option.

You can also rest safe in the knowledge that you are investing in an award-winning subwoofer because the KEF KC62 was recently announced as the ‘Best Product’ in the Hi-Fi Subwoofer Category (2021–2022) by the Expert Sound and Imaging Association (EISA) which is comprised of expert reviewers from more than 60 technology magazines and websites based around the world.

Laboratory test report

Newport Test Labs first tested the KEF KC62’s frequency response using a near-field technique for all settings of the subwoofer’s equalisation control at both maximum and minimum settings of the crossover control the results of which are shown in Graph 1 below.

(Image credit: Newport Test Labs)

You can see that the flattest and most extended response is returned when the KEF KC62 is set for Room Eq with the maximum crossover setting being shown by the black trace and the minimum setting by the red trace. You can see that overall at the maximum setting the KC62’s response extends from 17Hz to 150kHz ±4dB and between about 23Hz and 100Hz it’s even more linear at around ±2dB. These are truly excellent results.

When looking at the other traces on this graph (as well as the traces on Graphs 2 and 3) you need to bear in mind that these traces were measured with the subwoofer in the centre of a room not in the positions it would be for the relevant equalisation settings. This means that for the ‘Wall Eq’ setting (the green and blue traces) the offset downwards in level that’s evident would be compensated for by the subwoofer’s output being boosted by the proximity of the wall which KEF’s engineers calculate would elevate the traces to that of obtained in the Room Eq mode.

The same would be true of the Corner Eq (purple and blue traces) and the Cabinet Eq (dashed black and dashed red traces) modes. The traces on Graph 1 that have a completely different appearance are those for the Apartment Eq mode (dashed green and dashed light blue traces) where the low-frequency response has obviously been deliberately rolled off far sooner than for all the other Eq settings.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Newport Test Labs) (Image credit: Newport Test Labs)

Graphs 2 and 3 are subsets of the full set of frequency responses that are shown in Graph 1 so you can see the effect of the equalisation more clearly with Graph 2 showing a set with the crossover at its maximum setting and Graph 3 a set with the crossover at its minimum setting.

(Image credit: Newport Test Labs)

In Graph 4 Newport Test Labs has used a pink noise test signal to measure the KEF KC62’s far-field in-room response using the Room Eq mode and maximum (black trace) and minimum (red trace) settings of the crossover control. Unlike the other frequency responses where the subwoofer had to reproduce just a single frequency for each graph point this test requires the subwoofer to reproduce all frequencies across its pass band simultaneously and is thus an extreme test.

Nonetheless you can see the KC62 still delivered excellent performance with the response at the maximum crossover setting extending from 35Hz to 180Hz ±4dB and with the crossover set at minimum from 15Hz to 100Hz ±4dB. The increased linearity and extension when the crossover is at minimum reflects the reduced workload on the drivers due to the crossover network reducing the level of the high-frequencies.

(Image credit: Newport Test Labs)

The by-pass frequency response of the KEF KC62 is shown in Graph 5 and you can see that it’s exceedingly flat across the audio band being just 0.5dB down at 5Hz and about 0.18dB down at 20kHz. However it appears there is a low-pass filter built in that attenuates frequencies above around 22kHz.

(Image credit: Newport Test Labs)

The effect of the KEF KC62’s high-pass filter is shown in Graph 6 with the bypass response without any filtering depicted by the yellow trace. The effect of the filter is shown for all its settings: 40Hz (purple) 60Hz (light orange) 80Hz (light grey) 100Hz (light blue) and 120Hz (black). As you can see it’s a beautifully designed ‘classic’ high-pass filter.

Newport Test Labs measured the maximum volume level of the KEF KC62 with pink noise test signals as being 98dBSPL at one metre which was a limit imposed by the KC62’s in-built protection system due to the wideband nature of the test signal. When using a single 80Hz test tone the KEF KC62 was able to deliver 106dBSPL at the same distance which is 1dB better than specification."

Back in April Aldi announced that a planning application for a second store on the Skehard Road was to be submitted to Cork City Council with plans to open a 1337sqm store in 2024.

Aldi’s existing Blackrock store located at Blackrock Hall opened in 2008 and is one of the busiest of all its stores.

The new Aldi store was to be part of a mixed-use development which also included proposals for 28 residential units and a café.

The proposed development was to be constructed across two three-storey buildings at a site located next to Scally’s SuperValu supermarket on the Skehard Road.

The site is currently occupied by a single house which was to be demolished before the two blocks were to be developed.

Developers Lyonshall Ltd were to be responsible for the residential units whilst Aldi was to build the commercial element.

Cork City Council required further information before making a decision on the application which led to some changes being made to the proposed scheme but ultimately the council refuse planning permission.

Decision

In its decision the council stated that the proposed development by reason of its layout massing scale height and proximity to the southern and eastern boundaries of the site “would be visually obtrusive result in overshadowing of adjoining properties and as such would seriously injure the residential amenities of adjoining properties and be out of character with the area”.

As part of its reasoning the council also stated that the proposed development site is considered an “out-of-centre site” in accordance with the order of priority for the location of retail developments as set out in a section of the City Development Plan 2015-2021.

“In this regard only in exceptional circumstances can such sites be considered where it is demonstrated that no other sites or potential sites including vacant units are available and viable.

“It is noted that there is a nearby underutilised Neighbourhood Centre at Avenue de Rennes where there is currently no retail provision available” the council added.

Now Lyonshall Limited has lodged an appeal with An Bord Pleanála in a bid to overturn the council’s decision.

In the appeal report prepared by HW Planning it states that the applicants consider that the demand for additional retail provision to serve the area has “long been established and is not disputed”.

“We accept that the council had a desire and ambition that this need in the form of a medium size supermarket be met in Avenue de Rennes.

“The challenges of this location in terms of site assembly were acknowledged in the 2014 Mahon LAP” the appeal report states adding that Avenue de Rennes “is not a viable alternative”.

The applicants also state that they consider the proposed development is appropriate for the site of proposed development based in policy terms.

“The feedback from the council’s Further Information Request has resulted in a revised layout that is sensitive to the residential amenities of the adjacent dwellings.

“It is envisaged that no significant impacts will arise on the latter from the proposed development a view supported in the accompanying technical reports” the report continues.

An Bord Pleanála is due to make a decision on the case by late-May.",,,

Blackstone reported $1.4 billion in net income in the fourth quarter and $5.9 billion for the year nearly six times what they made the previous year.

That premium reflects the changing ways Americans live work and shop during the pandemic. Since 2019 more Americans have been looking for larger homes and buying more online. That’s spurred demand for warehouses and logistics facilities as well as put pressure on residential rents.

Institutional investors like Blackstone now valued $84 billion have ratcheted up their assets in the sector. Much of Blackstone’s recent growth has been driven by the firm’s real estate holdings from residential to commercial buildings especially warehouses.

On the Jan. 27 call with investors Blackstone’s executives explained rents for real estate sectors in their portfolio had risen as much as two to three times faster than the overall inflation rate. Relatively short leases on their properties have allowed them to raise prices quickly capturing more value from renters even as the inflation rate in the US economy topped 7%. Blackstone’s property portfolio includes everything from massive data centers and industrial warehouses to apartments and single-family homes mostly throughout the southern and western US. It’s leading a wave of institutional investors buying up homes in the suburbs.

The US saw significant rapid rent increases in 2021 driven by surges in demand set off by the pandemic. In some cities median asking rents went up 30% or more within the year. That has put pressure on some individual renters struggling to afford rent hikes but it’s helped bring in massive profits for corporate landlords like Blackstone that own the real estate.

In remarks during the shareholders call on Jan. 27 Blackstone president and COO Jonathan Gray said “In my 30-year career I’ve never seen real estate fundamentals in the sectors where we are focused as strong as they are today.”

Blackstone’s banner year

Real estate has become Blackstone’s most lucrative business. Led by its Blackstone Real Estate Investment Trust the firm owns more than 3000 properties including some 950 million square feet of logistics real estate space. It also made a huge investment in single-family rental homes in July 2021 when it acquired Home Partners America and its more than 18000 single-family rental homes.

These investments have paid off—nearly half of Blackstone’s earnings for the year came from real estate the most of any one sector. In buying strategically in rental housing and logistics in particular Blackstone has set itself up to dominate in two areas that have seen rapidly-growing demand; logistics companies like Amazon hunger for more space to expand e-commerce supply chains and American families looking for single-family homes but unable to buy. A September 2021 report of Blackstone’s real estate holdings shows that nearly all of its residential and industrial rentals had occupancy rates above 90%.

Why the rent is so high

Even though demand for new home construction is rising the inventory is not. New home construction has lagged behind population growth for years in the US. The construction industry has been hampered by labor shortages material cost increases and delays during the pandemic. The insufficient supply of affordable for-sale housing pushes more people into the rental market keeping demand high.

Rental prices especially for units with two bedrooms or more soared in 2021. The latest national rent report from online rental platform Apartment List found rents rose 18% last year. The pandemic also set off huge swings in demand in rental markets as people initially left cities en masse and rents decreased then returned creating a new wave of demand.

Much of this increase can be attributed to consumer price inflation as the US economy recovers from the impacts of the pandemic. As inflation rises and demand for rentals stays high property owners are incentivized to raise rents. Commercial landlords like Blackstone have the opportunity to do so when leases turn over quickly raising the value of what Gray called “short-duration hard assets.”

It’s possible these conditions will change. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates as expected in 2022 helping curb inflation and cool off the rental market benefiting landlords.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcmVhbHR5Yml6bmV3cy5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtYm9vbS1kcml2ZXMtcmVjb3JkLWVhcm5pbmdzLWZvci1ibGFja3N0b25lLzk4NzY2MDA5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Real estate boom drives record earnings for Blackstone,"The investment management firm Blackstone delivered record-breaking returns in the fourth quarter thanks to incredible growth in the commercial and residential real estate industries.

The company reported “the most remarkable results in our history on virtually every metric” said Blackstone co-founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman as the company announced its fourth quarter earnings results.

Blackstone said its $280 billion real estate business was responsible for approximately half of its profits last year.

Blackstone has made big investments in rental housing logistics and life science office complex which account for around 70% of its equity portfolio. Rents in all three sectors have been rising at two-to-three times the rate of inflation the company said.

With the boom in e-commerce due to the pandemic there has been a rush to find logistics hubs and warehouses to meet that demand. Vacant properties are more difficult to find sending rents and prices up.

At the same time Blackstone has pushed aggressively into rental housing the Real Deal reported. For instance it recently said it would buy around $1 billion worth of affordable single-family rental homes adding around 4000 such properties to its portfolio in the next two years.

At present around 80% of Blackstone’s real estate portfolio consists of rental housing and logistics. The company said in the earnings call both sectors are better insulated from inflationary pressures with their shorter-term leases.

“Blackstone’s fourth-quarter results represented a remarkable finish to a record-breaking year” Schwarzman said.

Blackstone nearly doubled its net income to $2.9 billion since the fourth quarter of 2020. Its real estate investment trust and its Core+ business accounted for the majority of those increases. Its real estate ventures appreciated by 12% and its Core+ segment by 7.2% The Real Deal reports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2xvZ2lzdGljcy9ibGFja3N0b25lLXVudmVpbHMtaG9yaXpvbi1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLXBhcmtzLWluLWluZGlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone Unveils Horizon Industrial Parks in India,"Blackstone on Friday announced the launch of Horizon Industrial Parks a portfolio of Indian logistics assets assembled from a series of warehouse investments by the US private equity giant in the country.

The Manhattan-based fund manager has tapped Rahul Pandit to serve as chief executive of the new platform which consists of assets from the firm’s investments in Embassy Industrial Parks TARC and Allcargo over the last 18 months.

“I am thrilled to work with the team at Blackstone to support its contribution to India’s ‘Atma Nirbhar’ vision the government’s aim to make India a self-reliant and competitive global player” Pandit said in a release. “The platform backed by Blackstone’s global intellectual capital and scale combined with local partnership opportunities will potentially enable us to rapidly accelerate growth and deliver exceptional quality to our customers while contributing to the communities we serve.”

The establishment of Horizon sets up Blackstone to redeploy in India a logistics platform playbook that it has already used successfully in the US Europe and just last year in Australia where it sold the Milestone logistics portfolio to ESR in April for $2.9 billion.

Pieces Come Together

Pandit joined Blackstone in December after leading Hamstede Living a co-living joint venture of US private equity major Warburg Pincus and Lemon Tree Hotels the Indian hospitality chain where he previously served as an executive for 12 years.

India’s biggest warehouse landlord completed its long-anticipated acquisition of Embassy Industrial Parks from rival Warburg Pincus and Bengaluru-based developer Embassy Group for a reported $700 million last May picking up 10.6 million square feet (984772 square metres) of Grade A logistics and warehouse assets near major cities in India.

In September Blackstone announced the acquisition of a North Delhi warehouse asset from local developer TARC Ltd for $40 million. The Economic Times of India had reported in August that the Embassy Industrial Parks unit would develop a 1 million square foot warehousing facility at the 36 acre (14.6 hectare) North Delhi site which sits 60 kilometres (37.3 miles) from Delhi Airport.

In late 2020 Blackstone completed the acquisition of a 90 percent stake in Mumbai-based Allcargo’s warehouse business for INR 1400 crore (now $186.5 million) including INR 380 crore of the US firm’s equity. Allcargo has 6 million square feet of developed logistics parks across major cities and 3 million square feet under development the Business Standard reported.

Asheesh Mohta head of real estate acquisitions in India for Blackstone said the firm has built Horizon Industrial Parks into one of India’s largest and most distinguished logistics portfolios with the firm indicating that the assets are anchored by tenants in fast-growing sectors such as e-commerce retail electric vehicles and logistics.

“We are excited to continue expanding our logistics presence in India’s prime urban centres bringing our global experiences in logistics and operating expertise to build out a full-service platform with exceptional management capabilities” Mohta said. “We are confident that the platform will thrive under the leadership of Rahul and a team of industry veterans and its scale can have far-reaching positive impacts on tenants employees and members of the Indian community.”

Seeking a New Milestone

With the unification of Horizon Industrial Parks the firm founded by billionaire chairman Stephen Schwarzman seems on its way to reprising a strategy it has employed in Australia and Europe: assembling a logistics mega-portfolio with an eye towards a later exit.

Last April Blackstone agreed to sell its Milestone Logistics portfolio in Australia to ESR Milestone Partnership a collaborative venture of Hong Kong-listed ESR and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC for $2.9 billion after a protracted bidding contest with four other contenders.

In 2017 Blackstone scored Europe’s single largest real estate deal ever when it sold the Logicor platform to China Investment Corporation for $13.8 billion. That deal which involved 630 distribution centres in 17 European countries came after Blackstone had completed more than 50 transactions to acquire and tune the Logicor platform.

In India Blackstone also owns the Nucleus Office Parks portfolio and the Nexus Malls retail platform. The firm’s global real estate business has $279 billion in investor capital under management."

Comlux

Boeing has a lucrative side business in which it sells commercial jets as private jets to ultra-wealthy travelers.

Boeing Business Jets can be found in the fleets of billionaires heads of state and national governments.

One aircraft that Boeing expects to be a top sellers is the 737 Max despite it's near-two-year grounding.

Airlines are not the only Boeing customers eager to buy up the 737 Max aircraft.

A small percentage of Boeing's yearly sales are not made by airlines but by ultra-wealthy individuals national governments and heads of state looking to buy some of the world's largest private jets. And each of Boeing's commercial airliners has its own private jet variant known as Boeing Business Jets.

One aircraft that Boeing says is primed to be a best seller is the 737 Max or the Boeing Business Jet 737 Max in airliner-turned-private-jet parlance.

""I wish we could build more airplanes because we seem to have the demand for it in the near term"" JD Detwiler president of Boeing Business Jets told Insider. ""It's the future for BBJ and you're going to see a lot of additional orders here hopefully in the next year or so.""

In 2021 Boeing landed two orders for the BBJ 737 Max showing that the wealthy are just as willing as airlines to trust the aircraft after a 20-month grounding by global regulators. Expected customers for the aircraft include the approximately 200 current owners of BBJ 737 aircraft that may want to upgrade to a newer Max and take advantage of its cost-saving economics and lower operating costs.

Three of the four Max variants are currently for sale as Boeing Business Jets. Only two however are currently certified including the Max 8 and Max 9. The Max 7 variant is scheduled to be certified in 2022 while the Max 10 is on track for a 2023 certification.

Max aircraft range in price from $99.7 million for the smallest Max 7 to 134.9 million for the largest Max 10. Airlines typically never pay the published list price because they are frequent customers but it's unknown how much a price break an ultra-high-net-worth buyer might receive when negotiating with Boeing if any.

The timeline between purchase to flying passengers for a given BBJ 737 Max is around two and a half years Detwiler said factoring in 12 months to build the aircraft three months to install auxiliary fuel tanks to give the aircraft its extra range capabilities and another 12 months to complete the interior. The first two BBJ 737 Max aircraft only entered service with their owners in 2021.

Boeing only builds the aircraft and delivers them to customers. Auxiliary fuel tanks are installed by Aloft AeroArchitects in Delaware while interior completion can be performed by licensed BBJ interior completion centers including the likes of Comlux in Indianapolis Indiana or AMAC in Basel Switzerland.

Boeing also expects to soon land business jet orders for its newest commercial aircraft the $442.2 million 777X that's soon to be the world's largest twin-engine aircraft once certified.

The Boeing 777X at Dubai Airshow 2021. Thomas Pallini/Insider

The 777X will be the largest Boeing Business Jet that customers can buy new once the Boeing 747 exits production later this year. The high price tag however will likely mean that the aircraft is outside of the budget for most individual shoppers.

Even with Boeing putting one of its darkest periods behind it Boeing Business Jet leadership says that customers still ask about the grounding. But with a full year's worth of largely uneventful Max flights and airlines once again spending billions to acquire the aircraft the wealthy are primed to fall in love with the Max.







""We saw it first with the commercial return to service a lot of our customers in the US for instance saw that customers love the Max they feel very safe in the Max and I think that our airline customers in particular love the efficiency of the Max"" Detwiler said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jb3BhLWFpcmxpbmVzLWJvZWluZy03MzctbWF4LW9wcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Look At Copa's Boeing 737 MAX Operations,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jb3BhLWFpcmxpbmVzLWJvZWluZy03MzctbWF4LW9wcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3FhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtbGF1bmNoLWJvZWluZy03Nzd4LWZyZWlnaHRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qatar Airways to launch Boeing 777X Freighter?,"Bloomberg is reporting that Boeing is set to launch the 777X freighter with a 50-aircraft commitment from Qatar Airways.

Seven months into her first salaried job out of college Karina Mejia realized she wasn't in the right place.

""I remember looking around the office and there was nobody I wanted to be like"" she told Insider. ""And that was a huge red flag.""

Mejia graduated from Boston College in May 2019 and took an analyst job at a Boston-based real estate consulting firm in June. ""It was very corporate America"" she recalled. ""It was me staring at a screen from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. It was just not fulfilling."" It paid well for a first job though: a base salary of $65000 a year.

She already had her real estate license which she got in college and had even closed a couple of deals on the side. The first big commission she earned was in August 2019. She collected an $8000 check she said and that's when she realized just how lucrative a career as an agent could be. She'd lose the security that comes with a salaried job and a consistent paycheck but had the opportunity to boost her income tremendously.

""With sales the question is always: Am I good enough? Can I build this business? Can I be that person?"" said Mejia. She decided to bet on herself and quit her corporate job in January 2020 to go all-in as a real estate agent.

""I had no idea who my next client was going to be or if this was even going to work"" she said. ""But I just remember thinking 'I'm 22. If this doesn't work and I have to go back to corporate America then fine.' I left on good terms with my boss and that was always an option but I definitely took a leap of faith.""

The risk paid off: Mejia now 25 earned $342000 in real estate commissions in 2021. Insider reviewed sales commission reports that showed these details.

Here's how she started building her real estate portfolio at age 22 and how she invests her six-figure income.

Living at home and working 3 jobs to save for her first property

After graduating Mejia moved back in with her parents who also live in Boston to save on housing. She couldn't justify paying for rent when she had a free option even if it meant moving back into her childhood bedroom.

If you have the ability to live with family at the start of your career it doesn't have to be as big of a sacrifice as it may seem she said. ""You don't have to think that you're giving up your freedom. It's just a smart financial thing to do for the first year or a couple of months as you're getting started and paying down your loans.""

Mejia graduated from Boston College in 2019. Courtesy of Karina Mejia.

Mejia had $15000 worth of student loans but her priority was to invest in a property. ""That was always my first goal as soon as I could save up enough money"" she said adding that it made sense for her financially: The interest rate on her loans was around 5% so she decided that if she could get more than a 5% return elsewhere she'd be fine delaying her loan payments. ""It was a matter of where was my money better spent."" She still made the minimum payments on her loans each month she said but didn't feel the need to pay them down completely before buying a property.

She started saving for a down payment while simultaneously looking for a property. In addition to her day job Mejia kept the part-time job she had in college as a banquet server at the Boston Harbor Hotel. Plus she was collecting commissions as a real estate agent.

""There would be days when I was working at my corporate job then I would walk over to my banquet server job at night and then on my break I'd be calling trying to negotiate real estate transactions"" she said. ""It was definitely a lot at that point.""

It paid off: By late 2019 Mejia had about $30000 in savings earmarked for her first property she said.

Buying her first property at 22 and ""house hacking"" to offset the mortgage

Mejia was looking for a property that she could live in and also rent out to offset the cost of her mortgage. It's a strategy known as ""house hacking"" and has helped a lot of property investors get their foot in the door.

She got pre-approved with a lender for a mortgage and then kept her eye on the market. It helped that she knew what to look for. ""I wanted a multi-family home"" she said. ""I wanted an income-producing property — one that would cash flow once I moved out.""

She found a place that fit the bill and submitted an offer but the seller went with somebody else. That buyer's financing fell through though meaning the property came back on the market. Mejia noticed and immediately submitted an offer. It included a stipulation. ""The seller wanted to hold an open house and I didn't want to give anyone else a chance to see it and risk getting outbid"" she explained. ""So I gave a really great offer above ask and said that it would not be on the table once the open house started.""

It worked and Mejia closed on the $560000 three-family home in November 2019. She financed it with an FHA loan and put 3.5% down or about $20000 she said. She moved in and by mid-December had tenants move in as well. Their rent nearly covered her entire mortgage payment she said.

Expanding her real estate portfolio in Boston and Georgia

In early 2020 Mejia added to her real estate portfolio and bought her second home in Boston where she and her girlfriend Sasha currently live. She used a loophole to finance it with another FHA loan (these are government-backed loans that are popular amongst new homeowners because they allow you to buy with a small down payment).

""In the U.S. you can only carry one FHA loan at a time so we joke in the industry that you need to use your FHA before you get married"" explained Mejia. ""It's a joke but it is solid advice: Before you actually get married you should each use your own FHA loan.""

She financed her second property a three-family home in Boston but the mortgage is under Sasha's name. They live in one unit and rent the other two out which covers their entire $3500 mortgage Mejia said meaning they live for free.

She also owns three properties in Augusta Georgia. Situated near the South Carolina border and home of the Masters Tournament Augusta came on Mejia's radar after she joined a real estate mastermind group made up of investors all over the U.S. She connected with an Augusta-based property investor who recommended she look into the market.

""There are a ton of markets in the U.S. that make sense for cash flow — there are a couple of things you need to look at but most importantly the price-to-rent ratio needs to make sense — and Augusta is just one of those markets"" she said.

Shopping in a different state required more due diligence but it helped having a contact who knew the area well she added. ""We all know that places can vary street by street. I know that very well in my market but I obviously can't tell in a market I'm not as familiar with. That's where I really leaned on my connection.""

In total Mejia owns five properties and has a sixth under agreement that she expects to close in February 2022.

Earning nearly $400000 in 2021

Mejia earned about $43000 in rental income from her properties in 2021 she said. The bulk of her earnings though came from real estate commissions. In 2021 she earned $342000 in commissions on the 42 deals she closed.

Her commission varies between 2% and 3% of the sale. The biggest commission she earned in 2021 was $14880 on a $620000 home she sold in September.

She didn't anticipate real estate being so lucrative. When she quit her analyst job in early 2020 to be an agent full-time she came to terms with the fact that she might have to return to corporate America if it didn't work out. She also quit knowing that she had her server job to fall back on but when Covid hit ""that industry closed down for a long time and I didn't have any work on that end"" she said. ""So the only way I could make money at that point was via real estate.""

Mejia also started an eCommerce store in 2021. ""It's essentially drop shipping"" she said. ""So I buy home goods from other stores and sell them for a profit on Amazon.""

She's focusing on increasing her income in 2022. Her goal is to earn an additional $3000 per month in passive income. To do so she's going to look into short-term rentals. ""The income on a short-term rental is more than on a long-term"" she said. ""You can expect $2000 to $3000 in profit per month depending on where your rentals are."" Another one of Mejia's goals is to reach a net worth of $1 million before she turns 28.

If you want to start investing in properties ""figure out what the next easiest step is and do that"" advised Mejia. ""If that's an owner-occupant home then do that. If that's a turnkey home then do that. But take action. The advantage I have is that I bought a home at 22 years old and then by the time I was going to do another investment I already knew what to expect. I already knew what to do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbG9jYWxwcm92LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy90aGlzLW1heS1iZS10aGUtbWFqb3ItcmVhc29uLXdoeS1yaS1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS1wcmljZS1jb250aW51ZS10by1za3lyb2NrZXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This May Be the Major Reason Why RI Real Estate Prices Continue to Skyrocket,"This May Be the Major Reason Why RI Real Estate Prices Continue to Skyrocket

Rhode Island’s economy has become more and more intertwined with Boston’s. Tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders now work in the Boston metro area. And more and more Massachusetts residents are relocating to Rhode Island seeking less expensive real estate costs.

In December Rhode Island’s real estate prices were up 15.3% over a year earlier.

Not only are the prices of homes skyrocketing but also the prices of apartments - especially in more upscale apartments in Providence in which a one-bedroom unit can fetch $2000 a month.

What is driving the multi-year increase in real estate in Rhode Island — look no further than the explosive increase in apartment prices in Boston.

The relatively less expensive Rhode Island is good news for the Rhode Islanders who work in Boston and are paid a Boston salary but for Rhode Islanders living and working in Rhode Island it just means a more expensive cost of living.

Boston May Soon Surpass San Francisco for the Price of an Apartment

San Franciso is ranked as the second most expensive city in the United States -- second only to New York City.

According to the price tracking by the real estate website Zumper San Francisco currently holds that title after falling behind New York in the summer of 2021. But San Francisco’s stagnant rent growth coupled with Boston’s dramatic rebound has the latter within striking distance of the former. In January Boston’s median one-bedroom rent rose to $2720 setting a new all-time high. San Francisco’s median one-bed rent is $2850 putting Boston just $130 behind.

Boston apartment prices have jumped 26.5% year-over-year for a one bedroom and that is helping to drive the price increase in Providence — up 8.2% in the past 12 months.

“It’s hard to overstate how astounding that is. In the winter of 2019 San Francisco’s median one-bedroom rent was $1300 higher than Boston’s. But the pandemic disrupted rental patterns all over the country. Wealthy residents and young professionals left the city and prices went into free fall in both cities. Between March 2020 and January 2021 Boston’s median one-bed fell by 19.2 percent while San Francisco’s fell by a staggering 23.4 percent” reports Zumper.

Prior to the pandemic about 25000 took the MBTA from Providence/Stoughton train into Boston daily — that number has decreased while workers were working from home. But that number is expected to rebound and potentially increase due to the number of workers from Massachusetts renting and now new home buyers in Rhode Island.

Further tying the two cities together are thousands of Rhode Island homes that have been purchased by Massachusetts residents.

Recent data indicates that 24% of all realtor-assisted property sales involved buyers from other states. In the luxury market comprised of properties sold for $1 million or more 53% of sales are derived from out-of-state buyers.

“With the threat of climbing interest rates and rising rents buyers are focused on securing a home with a steady mortgage payment to help stabilize expenses. They’re often competing with out-of-state buyers who are turning to Rhode Island because our market is still a bargain even with the rise in prices that we’ve seen. The median single-family home price in Massachusetts last month was $520000. Compare that to our median price of $375000 add in the allure of coastal living and close proximity to Boston and it’s easy to understand Rhode Island’s appeal. But with the increased number of those buyers adding to the depletion of our housing inventory there’s much work to be done to shore up our housing stock” commented Del Borgo.

That’s causing some in the industry to worry that it will not only inhibit growth but also affect the quality of work as key positions become harder to fill and lower-level workers jump from company to company in search of a better compensation package .

The industry is hotter than ever with companies routinely raising millions of dollars in venture capital startups blooming on a weekly basis and developers planning more lab space seemingly by the day. But the pipeline of qualified workers to fill all of the added jobs can’t keep up with the burgeoning demand.

It’s almost like Massachusetts has too many biotechs.

Hiring “is definitely more competitive than it was a few years ago there’s just no question about it” said Michael Gilman chief executive of Waltham-based Arrakis Therapeutics which more than doubled its staff during the pandemic.

The surplus of startups reflects investors’ desire to pour more money into the world’s leading biotech hub. But with every new company that comes out of stealth mode or a mega-funding round that comes with mega-hiring goals the people problem has gotten worse.

According to the latest report from industry association MassBio nearly 85000 people work in the state’s life sciences sector up 55 percent from 2008.

Most of the hiring is happening in Cambridge where companies posted more than 2630 biotech job listings on Indeed.com from July through mid-January according to Biotech Networks which tracks employment.

Large companies such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Takeda Pharmaceutical as well as Moderna Therapeutics and its venture capital backer Flagship Pioneering were seeking the most workers during that period.

“You can’t walk two blocks around Kendall Square without receiving a job offer” said Jeanne Gray chief people officer at Relay Therapeutics in Cambridge only half-kiddingly. “I get the sense that a lot of candidates know the market is hot.”

Employee turnover is on the rise too. About 16.5 percent of life sciences employees in Massachusetts voluntarily quit their jobs last year a recent survey from research firm Radford found up from 13 percent in 2018. Both figures are high enough to affect a company’s effort to grow.

Naturally one way to recruit and retain people is to keep paying them more.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the average salary in Massachusetts for chemists and scientists was about $100000 in May 2020. But biotechs are finding that historical data and closely watched benchmark surveys from Radford quickly become outdated.

“One of my companies realized they had fallen behind in some positions by more than 10 percent” said Tony Mullin a biotech human resources executive. “They offered $130000 and were losing candidates because they were getting $145000 or $150000 from other companies.”

Executives said some firms seem to be aggressively outbidding each other for candidates though most agreed it isn’t a sound strategy.

“That’s not a sustainable game to be in upping the ante all the time” said Diego Miralles chief executive of Flagship-backed Laronde which came out of stealth mode last May and raised $440 million three months later. “Candidates definitely get offers that are higher than ours. Some we can’t match.”

There’s also a sense that employees are easily swayed by “title inflation” a phenomenon that occurs when people climb the corporate ladder faster by bouncing around.

”There’s a short-term satisfaction with getting a bigger title” said Daphne Karydas chief financial and operating officer of Flare. “But then along with it comes expectations of doing a certain role.”

Beyond compensation biotech firms are also paying close attention to perks and benefits. It’s not uncommon for companies to have ping-pong tables in their offices or to provide catered lunches Silicon Valley-style.

Dyno Therapeutics’ new office will have a rock climbing wall. Relay recently began offering employees free diapers for the first year of a child’s life. Pet insurance is becoming more common.

These offerings long popular in the tech world are somewhat new in the more conservative biotech industry and many of the firms splurging on them don’t yet generate revenue.

“When I started all they gave you was bad coffee” Miralles said.

Of course there’s more money to go around now.

Gilman said the first biotech he founded raised $4 million in its first round of funding more than 15 years ago; today companies can raise $400 million at the same stage.

Cambridge-based Generate Biomedicines which just raised $370 million plans to hire 420 people over the next two years. The company founded in 2018 by Flagship Pioneering is willing to pay the price for top candidates and reaches out to some before they’ve graduated.

But with such an ambitious hiring goal Gevorg Grigoryan Generate’s chief technology officer admitted “It’s kind of not entirely clear how we do that.”

“We’ve internally said keeping the bar high is the primary goal” he said referring to the quality of hires. “We will be hoping to reach our numbers but the numbers will never come first.”

Several companies said the pandemic combined with the desire to grow quickly prompted them for the first time to hire workers who don’t live in Massachusetts and have no plans to move to the state. It’s becoming a popular option for recruiting hard-to-find computational scientists or even some executives who don’t need to do experiments in a lab. But because of the pandemic even local lab-based employees are being given more freedom to do their reading or analysis at home a few days a week.

Grigoryan said expanding the talent pool beyond Massachusetts is an “easy way to kind of simplify the problem for yourself” in a tight labor market. But he warned that hiring too many remote employees to fill job openings could be a quick fix that forever changes what it means to work in the biotech epicenter of the world.

When it comes to culture and career development Grigoryan said “Oftentimes we found that being local is really important both for the company and the employee.”

Brendan Frey chief executive of Canada-based Deep Genomicssaid that in Toronto the artificial intelligence drug discovery firm had the “luxury of being the main act in town.” But after setting up an outpost in Boston with fewer than a dozen employees over the summer Frey said attrition is already an issue.

“People know in their gut that all of this kind of hyperactivity is perhaps not best for them or for the companies” he said. “Forgetting about whether they should join Deep Genomics or not I’m thinking ‘You’re going to run into trouble later on.’ ”

Adam Koppel managing director of Bain Capital Life Sciences said he often gets asked about what could slow the momentum of the Cambridge-Boston biotech ecosystem.

“The proliferation of new companies has created somewhat of a supply and demand mismatch in the marketplace for skilled managers” he said.

Koppel said the talent pool has not matured enough to fill key areas from the C-suite and clinical development all the way through to the commercial launch of products. And he said there is increasingly competitive intensity in the industry due to many “copycats” that are “going after the same targets.”

“The ecosystem could benefit from a certain degree of consolidation” he added.

At least for now though executives seem to believe that the biotechnology business in Massachusetts will keep expanding regardless of its hiring and retention problems.

“It is conceivable that all the capital dries up in our industry companies shut down lay off scientists and they have no place to go” Gilman said. “I don’t see that happening anytime soon honestly.”

The procedure was performed by cardiologist Adrian Fluture at Casper’s Wyoming Medical Center.

The Watchman designed by Boston Scientific is intended to prevent strokes for people with irregular heartbeats. It’s inserted via catheter: a surgeon navigates the device up through the patient’s blood vessels and implants it in their heart.

Atrial fibrillation a kind of heart rhythm problem is thought to affect between 2 and 6 million Americans.

When the heart doesn’t pump blood at a steady pace clots can form in its upper cavities. If those blood clots travel through the body’s circulatory system into the brain they can cause a stroke. People with irregular heartbeats are five times more at risk for stroke than the rest of the population according to American Heart Association data.

Most people with atrial fibrillation go on blood thinners to prevent that. But some like Salloum can’t take blood thinners because they’re vulnerable to internal bleeding.

The 74-year-old Casper man has been a patient of Fluture’s for several years now. Until recently there wasn’t anything Fluture could do to bring down Salloum’s risk of stroke.

That’s why Fluture — together with his peers at Wyoming Cardiopulmonary Services and Wyoming Medical Center — pushed to bring the Watchman to the Equality State. They finally got the go-ahead this fall after the cardiologist completed the necessary training.

“I started seeing a light at the end of the tunnel like ‘When could we start doing it?’” Fluture said. “And so Mr. Salloum happened to be at the right place at the right time.”

Salloum remembers Fluture broaching the subject when he came in for a check-up in November.

At first Salloum was a little apprehensive at the idea. But he said those worries went away after Fluture explained how the procedure worked.

The Watchman — shaped like a parachute and about the size of a grape — is implanted into the upper left pouch of the heart called the left atrial appendage. For people with atrial fibrillation that appendage is where stroke-causing blood clots can build up.

The device blocks off that pouch so blood clots can’t escape and travel to the brain. It was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015.

Salloum said he feels like he’s 35 again. He underwent the procedure on a Thursday and was able to return to his job at a car dealership the following Monday he said.

“I can climb stairs up and down stairs with absolutely no effort” he said.

That came as a pleasant surprise to Fluture he said. The procedure is non-invasive and aside from a few weeks of recovery most patients don’t report side effects from the Watchman. But the device is preventive — it’s designed to reduce the risk of stroke not alleviate symptoms caused by an irregular heartbeat.

Still to prevent a stroke is to prevent catastrophic trauma Fluture said. Even one can be debilitating or deadly.

“Sometimes patients out of my experience don’t always comprehend the importance of doing a stroke reduction because they never experienced the stroke themselves” Fluture said.

As of Friday two other patients have received a Watchman at Banner. A few others were on the books to undergo the procedure over the past couple of weeks Fluture said but had to cancel due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Watchman is the second minimally invasive heart procedure to come to Wyoming over the past few years.

Until March 2020 Wyoming was the only state in the U.S. not to offer a related heart procedure called transcutaneous aortic valve replacement.

The aortic valve is responsible for making sure blood flows the right way through the heart. Traditionally if the valve is damaged or defective open heart surgery is needed to replace it.

But transcutaneous replacements like the Watchman implant are conducted via catheter.

Salloum has another couple of weeks of recovery to go but said the device has given him a new lease on life. He plans to celebrate by giving up smoking he said.

“I’m looking forward to living” he said.",,,,,,,,,

But in 1959 — disguised as a man — she won a medal at a judo tournament. When officials realized her gender she was forced to return it.

She did not take the injustice lying down. Kanokogi headed to Japan to continue training. She became the first woman to join a men’s group then fought for judo to be included in the Olympics — a reality in 1988.

Not bad for a Jewish girl from Brooklyn born Rena Glickman.

She overcame many odds to become “The Mother of Women’s Judo.” Now Eve Nadel Catarevas has battled many obstacles to tell Kanakogi’s story in a children’s book.

After a career as a copywriter interrupted by years raising her son it’s the Westporter’s first book.

Catarevas was raised in Greenwich. After Boston College she worked for Bristol Myers Squibb and Condé Nast.

She knew Westport from visits here with her parents — she recalls the Remarkable Book Shop and Ice Cream Parlor — and settled here with her husband Michael a writer. She raised their son Ben.

When he was grown she decided to act on her urge to write. She found a group of local authors and honed in on children’s literature.

Since she was a child she read obituaries. She was interested in underdog stories and when Kanokogi died in 2009 Catarevas was intrigued by her life. The only other place she read about Jewish girls she says is in Holocaust-themed books.

Besides a couple of stories in Sports Illustrated and Hadassah there was little written about Kanokogi. And Catarevas admits judo is “not the sexiest sport.”

Writing the book was difficult enough. Finding a publisher was even harder. There’s not a lot of market for children’s books about Jewish female judo experts.

In addition the author admits her subject was “not a delicate flower. She was a tough broad.”

Yet she adds “We all know about Billie Jean King and other women sports pioneers. Rusty deserved to be known too. I wanted to bring her into the light.”

Catarevas found Kar-Ben a publisher specializing in Jewish-themed material. The official publication date for Rena Glickman Queen of Judo is May 2. It’s gotten strong pre-publication reviews.

Catarevas’ first book took more than a decade to finish and publish. Her second is already in the works.

It’s another children’s book about a pioneering woman.

Annie Malone created a cosmetics line for Black women. She became one of the first African-American female millionaires.

You may not have heard of her either.

Thanks to Eve Catarevas you will soon.

In Q&A Brown discusses how she's grown more skeptical and less hopeful of change in the SBC despite recent steps that many others consider substantive.

It’s long passed the point at which Christa Brown gives the Southern Baptist Convention the benefit of the doubt.

A survivor of clergy sexual abuse and well-known advocate for reform Brown initially sought change in a state Southern Baptist convention in Texas and then in 2006 shifted her attention to the entire Nashville-based SBC. Her attitude about her advocacy has changed over the years.

“I will not apologize for my skepticism one bit. I think they have earned it and it will be a long time before they re-earn any trust from me” said Brown author of a new book “Baptistland: A Memoir of Abuse Betrayal and Transformation.”

Brown who has long parried character attacks and demeaning interactions with SBC leaders is known today for sharply criticizing the convention’s abuse response even when many consider that response more substantive than ever before.

But to Brown a former attorney based in Colorado there’s little difference in the results of the SBC’s current attempt to address abuse.

“Baptistland” which is Brown’s second book — her first was “This Little Light: Beyond a Baptist Preacher and His Gang” published in 2009 — traces recent developments in the SBC’s abuse response and why it has given her more doubt than ever. Brown shared in an interview what she thinks her book represents for the way abuse survivors engage in conversations about reform.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

The Tennessean: Your book often references the idea of “truth-telling” and how it’s guided your advocacy in the SBC. How has that idea changed over time and how do you define it today?

Brown: I’ve been doing this for some 20 years and it’s been an evolutionary process for me. In the early days and for a lot of years I believed that if I just put enough information out there that they would see the weight of this problem and there would be meaningful reform I viewed myself as speaking truth to power. But I don’t really view what I’m doing that way anymore. Now I think it’s more a matter of speaking truth with and for the powerless.

How do you respond to those who may see your current advocacy as resentful or cynical?

I don’t think it’s resentful or cynical but I do think it’s skeptical. I don’t think it’s bitter which is the adjective that gets thrown out quite a bit. If we put truth in a box and say those who tell the truth of their own stories of how they’ve been treated are resentful then it’s just one more way of keeping people in the box.

A lot of us raised in these religious groups we are so indoctrinated to be nice and to be good. But that inculturation and indoctrination has been used against us.

""Baptistland"" delves into your own personal history such as you the damage to personal relationships with family members after you spoke up about abuse. Why did you include those personal anecdotes alongside your narration of advocacy in the SBC?

Clergy sex abuse gets put into this box of what happens with the abuse. But the impact on the survivor’s life and their family — both their childhood family and their present family — is much bigger. I’ve heard these stories for years from survivors talking about estrangement in their families of origin. Because these are incredible painful stories this is a part of the dynamic most survivors do not talk about. So I felt it was important for people to see that part.

Often lost in the conversation about abuse reform in the SBC is the fact that different survivors approach the conversation differently. How do you see the differences between your approach and other survivors?

I don’t think you can fault for survivors for holding hope and wanting to believe that this is happening.

I keep wanting to come back to the real tangible facts. Are they helping survivors in tangible ways? Are they outing predators in ways that will make kids safer? And if they aren’t doing those things then all the other talk is kind of just window dressing.

“Baptistland” concludes with a letter to survivors. Why did you include that letter in the end and what are you conveying by including it?

I have tried to step away from all this a couple times before. Invariably there will be something about someone’s story that will draw me back in.

So the letter to survivors at the end of the book — I don’t know if that’s my swan song or not. I wanted to acknowledge them in some way and say: ‘I am always thinking about you. Even if I step away completely at some point you’ll still always be in my heart.’ I also put something in that letter to ‘please cultivate your own skepticism.’ Because I really think a lot of us need a lot more skepticism.

While she spent time in New York City in late April her absence from the event isn’t too surprising as she has been filming Stranger Things’ final season away from the city.

This has been a big year for Brown in the fashion space as the actress expanded her Florence by Mills line into clothing at the beginning of 2024. She spoke to ELLE.com in January about how her own experience dressing for red carpets led to the decision.

“[When Stranger Things took off] I was 10” she said. “I was going to these events and ceremonies and all these big fashion brands wanted to style me. I didn’t know what my personal style was and the only time I got dressed other than for ceremonies was to go to work. As I got older I was like ‘What is my personal style?’ A lot of my friends already knew [their styles] but I didn’t know mine. For me fashion has always been ever-evolving. It’s fluid and I wanted to create something so that girls going through that similar experience have a resource to be able to try innovative new outfits and styles and phases. I wanted to be able to create something that was accessible to my generation to my demographic so that when they go into a store they feel like they have that one corner—even if it’s a corner in the back—that they have what they’re looking for and they’re able to afford it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”"

Here's when Adele's Las Vegas residency will have to move forward if it will happen at all Can Adele's Caesars Palace residency overcome the conflicts that got it canceled — or is that it for the singer's big comeback tenure on the Strip? That question will need to be answered within the month according to TMZ. Insiders told the outlet this week that in the wake of the singer's decision to nix her planned three-month stint at the Sin City venue Caesars and promoter Live Nation are somewhat desperate to make a deal with Adele that will allow the residency to be rescheduled. The outlet's sources cited a variety of reasons Adele pulled the plug on the concerts from her alleged concerns about the sound system being outdated to issues with the set design which was reportedly supposed to include a ""special effects pool"" over which the star would appear during the performance. Multiple outlets have reported the pool was not up to par for Adele which could be related to the COVID-19-related ""delivery"" issues she's said contributed to the cancelation. The show ""just ain't ready"" she told fans through tears in a recent announcement. TMZ reports Caesars and Live Nation are hoping to iron things out in time that some mid-2022 dates could work but fans on social media have posited that the concert space already has such a full schedule it seems like 2023 would be a better bet.

According to an email excerpted by TMZ on Jan. 28 Jamie Spears' lawyer Alex Weingarten emailed Britney's lawyer Mathew Rosengart earlier this week to say Jamie would sit for the deposition he's been asked for repeatedly if Britney promises to sit for one as well. Sources tell the outlet Jamie's team wants to speak to the singer on-record about ""child safety and [possible] drug use"" while Britney's attorney has asked for months to question Jamie on his alleged use of the conservatorship he placed his daughter under for ""personal gain."" Insiders tell TMZ Brit's lawyer is likely to also raise the claims Britney made last year about her father's control over her life during the 13-year legal arrangement. In court she accused him of keeping her on psychiatric meds against her will and refusing to allow her to remove an IUD should she want to have another child. Jamie was suspended as Britney's conservator last year months before the conservatorship was terminated. The depositions could reportedly take place as soon as early March."

Soups are one of the most popular appetizers. They are rich in nutrients and energy. It is also one of the oldest food items that we still consume even today. Soups started to appear in history around 20000 B.C. It comes in mainly two types: clear and thick soups. We can prepare soups hot or cold depending on the location and occasion. We can make soup with vegetables meat fish and even fruits. Historians trace back the evidence for the existence of soups as far as 20000 B.C. But most sources agree that the widespread appearance of soup started somewhere between 5000 and 9000 years ago.

Soups are mostly liquid and are usually used as an appetizer. We can make them by boiling vegetables or meat at a high temperature. This preserves the nutrient content of the soups. Soups are generally offered to people who have diseases like the flu. Soup is also a popular choice for people in cold regions. Soup-making ingredients are easily available on the market. You can make soup by adding water or milk to canned soup and heating it. Soup is one of the easiest dishes to make in the kitchen.

Knox Gardner started the practice of soup swapping with his friends back in the 1990s. Around 2006 the day gained some popularity thanks to bloggers and the internet. The practice has attracted a lot of attention and people from various parts of the world celebrate soup swapping day. The day is ideal for getting together with friends or neighbors to swap your soup with others.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbW9udGNsYXJpb24ub3JnL25ld3MvZm9ybWVyLWdpYW50cy1wbGF5ZXItdmljdG9yLWNydXotdm9sdW50ZWVycy1hdC1wYXRlcnNvbi1jb21tdW5pdHkta2l0Y2hlbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Giants Player Victor Cruz Volunteers at Paterson Community Kitchen,"For many people in need in Paterson New Jersey lunch on Friday Jan. 28 had the taste of a warm touchdown.

Victor Cruz former American football wide receiver for the New York Giants continued his long-time partnership with Eva’s Village to provide around 350 nutritious and freshly prepared lunches for Paterson community members who currently experience or are at risk of homelessness.

Cruz a Paterson native took this opportunity to also give back to his community through the Victor Cruz Foundation. His nonprofit made a contribution of $5000 and 100 women’s coats that will strengthen the serving message of Eva’s Village.

Cruz explained why he is committed to community service.

“My mother was always encouraging me to go out into the community and give back to whatever capacity” Cruz said.

Since 1982 Eva’s Village has been assisting the Paterson community to meet the needs of adults and children who are vulnerable to food and shelter insecurity substance abuse mental health disorders and healthcare and employment barriers.

With the pleasant smell from Eva’s Village kitchen announcing lunchtime Eva’s Village staff volunteers church members the Giants administration and Cruz got to work getting lunches safely packed and distributed to the community. Just a few hours before the snowstorm arrived on the East Coast the lunch line started to form on Jackson Street and the first snowflakes began to fall.

Campbell Soup Company donated soup to be distributed to the community in recognition of the Giants’ commitment to community service. Ashley Lynn the director of player engagement at the Giants was named a Community Champion by the company for organizing annual Thanksgiving dinners at Eva’s Village.

Howard L. Haughton the CEO of Eva’s Village said he is grateful for the donations from Cruz and Campbell’s.

“[Cruz’s] generosity combined with Campbell’s wonderful donation of soup will not only warm the bellies of those we serve today but their hearts as well” Haughton said.

Loaded with many boxes of packed lunches warm Campbell’s soup and bottles of water Cruz and the Giants formed a production line to ensure everybody received every item for their meal.

One of the many people who benefited from the lunch is Eric Nunez. Nunez said once his unemployment benefits stopped last year he has struggled to make ends meet.

“I don’t have any means of income so I don’t have money to spend on food” Nunez said. “Paterson is good in the sense that there will be helping hands. Nobody will starve.”

At the end of the lunch line things started getting collected and cleaned. The hard work from the team was rewarded with warm lunches from Eva’s Kitchen.

For this Giants legend having the ability to give coats away organize drives and bring people together with the NFL team is beyond his dreams.

“I’m excited to be in a position to give back” Cruz said “That’s what it is all about.”",,,,,,,,,

This Is Us fans have been asking that question for years as members of the Pearson family have appeared one after another in a flash-forward at Kevin’s house. Kate is one of the only characters missing in the future as of season 6 and her portrayer Chrissy Metz is still wondering about her fate too.

Related: Everything We Know About This Is Us' Flash-Forward at Kevin's Although This Is Us is famous for skipping around to different time periods it’s the look into the future that has everyone talking. The scene was set way back in the third season: The family is gathered at Kevin’s (Justin Hartley) very nice home and it’s around the year 2032 — 12 years after the […]

“It’s interesting. I have been on interviews where I have said something and then the story has changed and I was like ‘Oh gosh.’ So who knows?” the actress 41 exclusively told Us Weekly on Wednesday January 26 while discussing her partnership with Capital One Auto Navigator. “I know that I have different wigs for different times but I don’t know if they’re gonna actually finalize me at a particular age or what’s gonna happen. So I’m not sure because sometimes it’s down to the wire. We’re like ‘Ah we’re gonna change something.’ But I can’t wait.”

Metz also played coy about whether she has already undergone the aging transformation. “I would love to see Kate aged up or [in] prosthetics” she added. “Jon [Huertas] and Mandy [Moore] go through three-and-a-half hours of prosthetics and I’m like ‘I wanna do that.’ So we’ll see. We’ll see. I hope so.”

In flash-forwards the Pearson family are gathering at Kevin’s (Justin Hartley) to say their goodbyes to Rebecca (Moore). Kate’s ex-husband Toby (Chris Sullivan) is there and has hinted that “they” are on their way though it is unclear whether that includes Kate who has yet to be seen at that point in the future.

This Is Us has weaved a complicated story over the course of six seasons but the show’s cast and creatives promised that all lingering questions will be answered before the series concludes. “My hope is that by the end of the series there is no stone left unturned” creator Dan Fogelman […]

While fans have speculated that Kate is dead in the flash-forward Metz teased a satisfying series finale.

“I want [fans] to take away that we are all dealing with life on life’s terms” she told Us. “It’s not really what happens to you but how you react to [it] and also that every single one of those characters are just like any person that you might know. I hope they pull away with contentment [and think] ‘Wow. Like I got to see this really beautiful chapter of these people’s lives and it’s a blueprint for the way I could walk in the world.’”

However Kate’s story ends Metz predicted that she will be emotional about it. “I think the last day on set is going to be either I’m going to be delusional that it’s not the last day — we’re gonna come back. Or I’m going to be a blubbering mess” she noted. “I don’t know if there’s any in between.”

As for what fans can expect from the final episodes the singer shared: “I know that every good thing must come to an end and we always talk about going out with the bang and not a thud. We will be doing that because this final season is taking us everywhere all through space and time.”

“The first phase were the real estate people” Leonsis said. “They wanted to build or buy the stadium and they were looking for things to put in it. They were in the rental business basically. The second phase of entrepreneurs came in and they were more media oriented. Cable was just launching which became a big new revenue stream. Turner CBS and Tribune got involved. The third generation was my generation: the web/internet [entrepreneurs].”

The former AOL executive who owns the Washington Capitals Wizards Mystics — and the city’s Capital One Arena — welcomes the fourth generation: private equity. In just the last several months the NBA NHL MLB and MLS have all cleared the way for large private equity firms to purchase minority stakes in their teams.

“There’s been big appreciation [in team valuations]” Leonsis continued. “The downside is how do you get monetized? The only way you could really [take advantage] is if you sell the team. There are some really big funds that can give you growth capital for you and your partners with some liquidity. It’s been a godsend for a lot of teams who went through the pandemic.”

None of Leonsis’ teams have taken private equity money but several others have — especially in the NBA.

The San Antonio Spurs are among them with Sixth Street Partners purchasing a 20% stake in the team last June.

“We’ve had decades of aligned leaders throughout the organization who’ve turned our bedrock of values into real life action and impact” Peter J. Holt chairman of Spurs Sports & Entertainment told Front Office Sports. “This combined with the leadership vision and creativity at the NBA league level is one of the many reasons why I believe we’re interesting to a group of dynamic partners.”

Techies Still Want a Slice

Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell purchased 10% of the Spurs at the same time of Sixth Street’s investment. Earlier this month Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia purchased an undisclosed chunk of the Spurs as well.

Gebbia told FOS that his investment wasn’t just a financial play.

He’s a longtime NBA fan and one of his first jobs in his native Atlanta was as a Hawks ballboy.

“The Spurs are just an incredible team” Gebbia said. “What the Bulls were in the ‘90s is what the Spurs were in the 2000s. Five championships in 15 years. You have Coach Pop [Gregg Popovich] and players like David Robinson Tim Duncan and Tony Parker — heroes as a kid I grew up looking up to.”

Before Airbnb Gebbia’s unofficial first startup was actually a college basketball team. He restarted a basketball program at Rhode Island School of Design that had been dormant for about 50 years.

“As a broke college student [team ownership] was in a dream somewhere” Gebbia said. “How could I be involved in the NBA one day? My first experience was starting that basketball team. I had to recruit the team and raise money. I had to market it as a brand.”

Limits of Minority Ownership

Minority ownership is often seen as more about prestige than power. You don’t have a lot of if any say in how the team is run and few teams pay dividends to their minority investors.

The same applies to private equity firms purchasing a stake in a team which is limited to 20% in any one NBA franchise.

No team can have more than 30% total of private equity ownership.

An institutional investor can invest in up to five NBA teams.

Rules are similar for the other leagues.

“The beauty of sports and the way the hierarchy works is that your team has to have a controlling owner who has 100% authority” Leonsis said. “What the leagues have done with the private equity firms was to create rules of the road on how much you can own. You can’t come to board meetings. You’re essentially a passive investor.”

A Major Return on Investment

One look at how much Leonsis’ sports investments have returned and it’s clear why private equity wants in.

Leonsis and his partners paid $85 million for the Capitals in 1999 and $551 million for the Wizards in 2010. (The Wizards purchase included the stake in Capital One Arena that Leonsis and his investors didn’t already own.) Now the Caps are worth $1.5 billion and the Wizards are valued at $1.9 billion.

According to Pitchbook since 2002 all four of the major U.S. sports leagues have performed better than the S&P 500 and in some cases by a very wide margin. Here are the leagues’ respective returns over the past 20 years:

NBA: 1057%

MLB: 669%

NFL: 558%

NHL: 467%

S&P 500: 458%

Valuations have held steady or risen since the start of the pandemic two years ago even as profits have fallen — a product of reduced schedules crowd-size mandates and a general concern over the spread of COVID-19.

Other forms of entertainment haven’t been able to weather the pandemic nearly as well as pro sports which are bolstered by massive TV contracts and more recently sports betting partnerships.

“We have proved to be a resilient industry” Leonsis said. “Everyone thought I was crazy for buying the Capitals for $85 million 20 years ago when the team was losing $20 million a year. Now it’s worth a billion and a half.”

However as pandemic concerns persist some guests looking to visit the most magical place on Earth as safely as possible are opting to limit their dining plans to outdoor settings.

Many of Walt Disney World's most popular and heavily themed best restaurants and dining experiences don't have an alfresco option so even Disney World regulars are finding themselves in new territory with old favorites temporarily off their must-do lists.

When it comes to table-service dining at Disney World outdoor seating can be tougher to come by especially inside the theme parks. Quick-service restaurants will be your most reliable means to keeping your meals outside but there are some great spots to enjoy table-service meals outdoors during your Disney World trip.

We've rounded up the very best spots at Walt Disney World to dine outside prioritizing table service but offering some reliable quick-service options where table service is scarce.

Things to know about outdoor dining at Disney

The most important thing to keep in mind when planning for outdoor dining at Disney World is to expect the unexpected and have a backup plan. Central Florida weather is highly unpredictable. From winter cold snaps to extreme summer heat and thunderstorms Mother Nature can sometimes derail your outdoor dining plans reducing or even closing outdoor seating areas.

The good news — if you've booked a table-service reservation and the restaurant is unable to seat you outdoors they will waive the same-day cancellation penalty if you explain why you need to cancel at the host stand.

With limited outdoor table-service options across Disney our recommendations lean heavily on ""lounges"" which typically serve shareable small plates and great cocktails but may not offer a traditional kids menu.

Some of the most atmospheric spots to eat at Walt Disney World are lounges but they do require you to get a bit creative with your meal — especially if you're used to a traditional three-course experience on vacation. But with an open mind and an empty stomach you just might discover some new favorites on our list of the best restaurants for outdoor dining at Walt Disney World.

Best outdoor dining at the Magic Kingdom

Magic Kingdom is the lightest of Walt Disney World's four theme parks on solid outdoor dining options when it comes to both food quality and atmosphere. We wouldn't choose any of the options on this Magic Kingdom list over others outside the gates so consider hopping to another park or nearby resort if none of these picks strike your fancy.

Table service

Tony's Town Square Restaurant

For outdoor table-service dining at Magic Kingdom Tony's Town Square Restaurant is your only option and it's not always available. The ""Lady and the Tramp""-themed spot serves Italian-American classics such as spaghetti and meatballs Tony's pizza pie and fettuccine alfredo. While the food tends to receive below-average reviews from diners the outdoor patio is a lovely spot overlooking Magic Kingdom's Town Square area of Main Street U.S.A.

Seating on the patio is only available when the weather and staffing levels permit so swing by the restaurant when they open to find out if they'll be seating outside during your reservation. If they're not cancel in person at the desk (be sure to explain why and they'll waive your penalty fee) and default to your backup plan.

Quick service

Casey's Corner

There's nothing fancy about dining at Casey's Corner but it's hard to strike out with corn dog nuggets castle views and even some live entertainment from the Casey's Corner pianist. There's a hot dog for every taste and appetite from Walt's chili-cheese all-beef foot-long hot dog (say that five times fast) to the plant-based loaded slaw dog.

Be sure to keep an eye on mobile order return times — this spot can get very popular at peak times of day — then grab a seat under one of the bright red-and-white umbrellas for a home-run meal.

Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn & Cafe

Tex-Mex standards like fajitas nachos rice bowls and burgers are on the menu at this Frontierland outpost one of Magic Kingdom's best-rated quick-service spots. Pecos Bill's large outdoor seating area fills up quickly as do mobile order return times so don't wait until your crew is famished to place an order.

Cosmic Ray's Starlight Café

You won't get more theme-park basic than the menu at Cosmic Ray's but sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered — especially for picky eaters. Burgers hot dogs and chicken strips are served at this futuristic Tomorrowland spot where it's typically a breeze to get a fully shaded outdoor table.

Best outdoor dining at Disney's Hollywood Studios

Like Magic Kingdom Disney's Hollywood Studios is light on the outdoor table service but this is one park where quick-service belongs on your must-do list. In my book the best food at Hollywood Studios comes from a galaxy far far away in the park's newest land Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and there are a couple of other solid options — enough to keep you eating well outdoors all day.

Table service

The Hollywood Brown Derby Lounge

The only outdoor table-service option at Disney's Hollywood Studios also happens to be the lounge portion of our pick for best table-service meal in the park: The Hollywood Brown Derby inspired by the famed Tinseltown icon.

Join the walk-up list for a table outside at The Hollywood Brown Derby Lounge where you can sip classic cocktails like an Old Fashioned Paloma or Hollywood Manhattan and nibble lounge entrees like Brown Derby's famous cobb salad shrimp cocktail and BLT sliders. Feeling extra hungry? The full restaurant menu is also available to order from the outdoor lounge tables.

Quick service

Woody's Lunch Box

It's no surprise that kid-friendly comfort food rules the menu at Woody's Lunch Box in Toy Story Land.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Serving breakfast lunch and dinner families flock to this colorful all-outdoor space for its own takes on the classics. Everyone has their favorite but you can't go wrong with the BBQ brisket melt grilled three-cheese sandwich served with a cup of tomato soup for dipping or the ""Totchos"" an over-the-top tater-tots-meet-nachos concoction topped with chili cheese queso corn chips sour cream tomatoes and green onions.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Daily lunch box tarts (think delicious homemade Pop-Tarts) and breakfast bowls are great to mobile order and grab for a quick bite after rope dropping Slinky Dog Dash or nearby Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway.

Docking Bay 7 Food & Cargo

If you want more than the basics out of your theme park menu then the Force is strong with the menu at the main quick-service location in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. Just look for the food freighter docked on the rooftop of this hangar-bay-turned-restaurant where Chef Strono ""Cookie"" Tuggs serves some of the best quick-service fare at Walt Disney World.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Dishes like the fried Endorian chicken Tip Yip smoked Kaadu pork ribs and plant-based Felucian kefta and hummus garden spread may sound — and look — otherworldly but they're crowd-pleasers even for less adventurous palates.

The seating area feels peaceful despite being steps from the hustle and bustle of Black Spire Outpost's Marketplace and the Millennium Falcon.

Ronto Roasters

Also in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge Ronto Roasters is like an out-of-this-world shawarma stand.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

A pitmaster droid turns the spit roasting a side of ""ronto"" an animal native to Tatooine but it's pork on the menu in the classic Ronto wrap — roasted pork grilled pork sausage peppercorn sauce and tangy slaw wrapped in pita bread. (This is actually TPG travel editor Madison Blancaflor's favorite in-park meal at Disney World.)

For vegans and vegetarians grilled zucchini and smoky chickpea-onion slaw fill the plant-based Zuchii Wrap. This is also one of the best spots in the park for breakfast. Bright Suns as the locals say.

Tables here are all outdoors and fill up quickly but there's always a standing bar to belly up to as a last resort.

BaseLine Tap House

Closer to a traditional bar than any other spot on this list BaseLine Tap House still deserves to make the cut for a wonderful outdoor seating area (with a great soundtrack) excellent — though limited — menu items and an enticing lineup of California wines and brews on tap.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy) 0 1

BaseLine is a great snack stop but adults could easily make a meal out of the California cheese and charcuterie the coffee-rubbed rib-eye steak puff and the giant Bavarian pretzel with beer-cheese fondue and spicy mustard. This menu will keep hungry kiddos happy too.

Best outdoor dining at Disney's Animal Kingdom

What Disney's Animal Kingdom lacks in outdoor table-service options it makes up for with consistently awesome quick-service food throughout the park and some idyllic dining spots to boot.

Table service

Nomad Lounge

None of the table-service restaurants at Disney's Animal Kingdom offer outdoor seating but Nomad Lounge the more casual offshoot of Tiffins Restaurant next door might just be the park's best-kept secret. Join the walk-up list (no reservations here) and select an outdoor table for seating on the lounge's wraparound terrace overlooking the Discovery River.

Drinks here have a cult following. Try the Hightower Rocks made with tequila watermelon sweet-and-sour and lime juice or the Kungaloosh Spiced Excursion Ale Draft an African-inspired amber ale brewed exclusively for Walt Disney World.

Relax on the comfy wicker couches as you watch the passing character flotillas and refuel with small plates like the Togarashi-spiced tuna nomad bowl Impossible sliders with chipotle aioli and yucca fries and churros served with vanilla crema and chili-strawberry.

Quick service

Flame Tree Barbecue

Barbecue lovers should follow their noses (after mobile ordering of course) straight to this outdoor spot serving up smokehouse specialties like pulled pork St. Louis ribs and slow-smoked chicken. Even the plant-based option the Hot Link Smokehouse Sandwich is a crowd-pleaser topped with slaw crispy onions and mustard barbecue sauce and served on a pillowy housemade roll.

If the food weren't enough of a draw Flame Tree boasts one of the most idyllic seating areas at any of the theme parks.

Sit alongside the tranquil pond or make your way down to the waterfront where — if you time it right — you'll get a front-row seat for a showing of Disney KiteTails the park's new can't-miss daytime show that launched in conjunction with Walt Disney World's 50th-anniversary celebration.

Satu'li Canteen

Satu'li Canteen is consistently ranked among the best quick-service restaurants at Walt Disney World — and for good reason. This spot located in Animal Kingdom's Pandora — the world of ""Avatar"" — is the perfect antidote after too many theme park meals of the fried fast-food variety.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 Satuli Canteen at Disney's Animal Kingdom. BROOKE MCDONALD/THE POINTS GUY 0 1

Fresh customizable bowls come with a choice of protein atop a hearty salad noodles rice and beans or red and sweet potato hash. Then top off your meal with a bright crunchy slaw and choice of sauce.

If bowls aren't your thing the steamed cheeseburger pods have a cult following too. Wash it all down with a bright green Hawkes' Grog Ale and a fan-favorite Blueberry Cream Cheese Mousse for dessert.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

The sprawling outdoor seating area is a perfect spot for taking in the sights and sounds of Pandora. Despite how popular Satu'li is it's usually easy to find a seat. We love mobile ordering Satu'li and timing it for pickup after a ride on Avatar: Flight of Passage which exits right at the entrance to the restaurant.

Best outdoor dining at Epcot

What the other parks lack in outdoor dining options Epcot makes up for in spades. Several table-service restaurants countless quick-service spots and rotating festivals all year make outdoor dining much easy to switch up here than at the other parks.

Table service

Rose & Crown Dining Room

This cozy pub in the U.K. pavilion includes plenty of outdoor waterfront seating overlooking World Showcase Lagoon. Just make sure you confirm your outdoor seating preference when you check-in for your reservation. A jolly good menu of British classics including top-notch fish and chips bangers and mash and shepherd's pie are best enjoyed with a proper pint or nip of scotch whisky and some sticky toffee pudding for dessert.

For dinner and a show you can book a Rose & Crown Fireworks Dining Package ($89 per adult and $39 per child) which will get you a prix fixe meal on the patio during Harmonious Epcot's new nighttime spectacular.

Spice Road Table

Technically a lounge Spice Road Table in the Morocco pavilion is walk-up only but it's almost always easy to snag a table.

The open-air colorfully tiled waterfront space is gorgeous. Service is excellent and the small plates are consistently delicious. Menu standouts include the vegetarian Tiropitakia cheese-filled phyllo topped with cucumber-tomato relish plant-based pomegranate-chili crispy cauliflower spiced chicken and fried calamari. Don't be deterred by all the ""spice"" in the descriptions. Spice is used more to denote rich flavors than heat — most dishes are extremely mild.

Spice Road Table also offers a Fireworks Dining Package during Harmonious for $72/adult and $31/child for a prix fixe meal.

Via Napoli Ristorante e Pizzeria

Serving easily the best pizza at Walt Disney World Via Napoli in Epcot's Italy pavilion churns out authentic Neapolitan pies flash-fired in wood-burning ovens named after Italy's three active volcanoes.

The food here is excellent but before you get too excited know that the outdoor seating is limited and very intermittent so it's definitely not a spot to count on for outdoor dining. As with other table-service restaurants that don't guarantee outdoor seating you're safe to make a reservation and put in your request to be outside. If they can't accommodate you you should be able to cancel without penalty in person.

Tutto Italia Ristorante

Like Via Napoli next door Tutto Italia doesn't consistently seat on the patio. When it does it's a solid spot for Italian classics like lasagne alla bolognese chicken parmigiana and cannoli and panna cotta for dessert.

Quick service

La Cantina de San Angel

The Mexico pavilion has two dependable table-service restaurants but neither offers outdoor seating.

Luckily La Cantina de San Angel hits the mark nearly as well as its pricier table-service neighbors. Chow down on delicious tacos de pollo barbacoa or pescado empanadas con queso and nachos.

The shaded waterfront seating area also makes this a great spot to kick back for a mid-day snack. Cool off with a frozen mango or lime margarita and some guacamole with totopos (we highly recommend a side of their excellent white nacho cheese to complement any chips order).

Regal Eagle Smokehouse: Craft Drafts & Barbecue

Opened Feb. 19 2020 this barbecue haven brought a welcome update to quick service in Epcot's The American Adventure pavilion. Regal Eagle Smokehouse is a meat-lover's paradise with a menu inspired by some of America's most famous barbecue regions and traditions.

Choose from flavorful entrees like Memphis dry-rub pork ribs sliced Texas beef brisket sandwich Kansas City smoked half-chicken and North Carolina chopped smoked pork butt platter complemented by classic sides like creamy coleslaw macaroni and cheese and baked beans with burnt ends. Even the vegan option includes double ""meat:"" The BBQ jackfruit burger is a plant-based burger topped with BBQ jackfruit lettuce and plant-based mayonnaise and served on garlic toast.

Katsura Grill

Steps from World Showcase's main thoroughfare is a tranquil escape that feels miles from the hustle and bustle of the park. Tucked away in a secluded elevated spot among the Japan pavilion's koi ponds and trickling waterfalls Katsura Grill serves sushi ramen udon and teriyaki. This is a great spot to bring overstimulated kiddos who need some quiet time (plus they'll love looking at the fish).

Yorkshire County Fish Shop

Save some money on the same delicious fish and chips served at Rose & Crown by getting them to go at the Yorkshire County Fish Shop's quick-service stand. Pick up a basket of crispy beer-battered hake and thick-cut chips and a cold draft Harp Lager or Bass Ale and enjoy an authentic British meal at one of the U.K. pavilion's many waterfront tables overlooking World Showcase Lagoon.

Best outdoor restaurants at Walt Disney World Resorts

Walt Disney World's numerous hotels all feature outdoor seating areas in conjunction with their quick-service dining locations. Some of Walt Disney World's most popular table-service restaurants including the brand-new Steakhouse 71 at Disney's Contemporary Resort and Sanaa at Disney's Animal Kingdom also now offer a ""To Go"" service enabling you to Mobile Order and enjoy your meal outdoors or back in your room.

If you want to visit a resort dining location be aware that you'll need a dining or hotel reservation in order to park. Rideshares are sometimes waved through but technically require a reservation for dropoff. To visit a resort without a reservation use Disney transportation.

Trattoria al Forno Disney's BoardWalk

Just steps from Epcot's International Gateway entrance and the Disney Skyliner station Trattoria al Forno on Disney's BoardWalk has a handful of outdoor tables that you can request upon check-in. A new chef and updated menu earlier this year have elevated the restaurant's previously mediocre Italian fare to a place among the best at Walt Disney World.

Menu standouts at dinner include the shrimp pappardelle veal osso bucco and plant-based rigatoni bolognese that even carnivores agree is perfection. The equally popular breakfast menu ideal for a leisurely meal before heading into Epcot puts an Italian spin on the classics with highlights like tiramisu-style french toast and caprese omelet.

Take in the boardwalk's great atmosphere at an outdoor table. If you can't snag a reservation you can also order Trattoria al Forno to go and enjoy it at one of the many tables on the boardwalk.

AbracadaBar Disney's BoardWalk

A perfect spot for people watching along the Atlantic City-inspired boardwalk AbracadaBar is a magician-themed lounge serving a very limited but delicious menu of small plates whipped up in the Trattoria al Forno kitchen next door.

Olivia's Cafe Old Key West

Lush tropical landscaping colorful buildings and a great soundtrack keep a nonstop vacation vibe going at Disney's Old Key West Resort. The original Disney Vacation Club Resort Old Key West is also home to one of Walt Disney World's hidden gem restaurants — Olivia's Café.

The restaurant serves island seafood dishes you'd expect from Key West such as crab cake and conch fritters but Olivia's is perhaps most famous for two Southern specialties: Olivia's famous grits at breakfast (one of the best on property) and southernmost fried chicken at lunch and dinner. Request an outdoor table in the sizeable outdoor seating area — and don't even think about leaving without having a Key lime tart for dessert.

Trader Sam's Tiki Terrace and Capt. Cook's Disney's Polynesian Village Resort

Trader Sam's Grog Grotto is one of the most heavily themed immersive dining spots at Disney and eating or drinking inside the famed tiki bar is a must when you're comfortable being indoors. However Trader Sam's Tiki Terrace the outdoor patio offshoot of the tropical watering hole is worth a visit in its own right.

A trickling waterfall lovely views of Seven Seas Lagoon with Cinderella Castle in the distance and (if you get your timing right) a live ukulele player or a showing of Disney Enchantment from Magic Kingdom make for a memorable evening on the terrace.

Grand Floridian Café and Gasparilla Island Grill Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa

Just a quick boat ride or 10-minute stroll down the walkway from Magic Kingdom Grand Floridian Café is a nod to the Victorian tea room serving breakfast lunch and dinner. Breakfast and lunch menus overlap with savory favorites. Try the lobster thermidor burger and fresh salads or breakfast classics such as steak and eggs and buttermilk fried chicken and waffles. All are available throughout the morning and afternoon. Outdoor seating can be requested at check-in but it's seasonal and typically only offered at breakfast or lunch.

If Grand Floridian Café isn't seating outside during your visit Gasparilla Island Grill is your best bet. The quick-service location around the corner has plenty of outdoor seating with views of Seven Seas Lagoon and Cinderella Castle and serves a variety of burgers hot and cold sandwiches pizzas and salads.

Enchanted Rose Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa

Another lounge for the win. This upscale ""Beauty and the Beast""-themed escape is dressed to the nines in elegant subtle nods to the film. Be sure to take a peek at the stunning main bar and cozy library before grabbing a spot on Enchanted Rose's heated patio.

Sip signature cocktails like the Lavender Fog Floral Bitter Beauty and rotating seasonal old fashioned. Then share small plates like flatbreads truffle fries and crab macaroni and cheese.

Bar Riva Disney's Riviera Resort

With just one outdoor table-service choice at Disney's Hollywood Studios a quick trip on the Disney Skyliner over to Disney's newest hotel Disney's Riviera Resort adds another fun option. Technically the resort's pool bar Bar Riva is a beautiful open-air space tiled in serene shades of blue with lots of nods to the Italian and French Riviera.

Bar Riva is walk-up only but offers a table-service service lounge menu of Mediterranean-inspired dishes such as tuna Niçoise and Greek salads baked brie in puff pastry and grilled vegetable skewers. If the tables are full and you don't want to wait quick-service Primo Piatto next door is a reliable backup. Mobile order it to go and find a spot outside.

Disney Springs

You'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to outdoor dining options at Disney Springs. With far too many strong contenders to list comprehensively the following are a few of our favorites (honorable mentions include Raglan Road and The Polite Pig) all of which offer outdoor seating — just note your preference at check-in.

Wine Bar George

George Miliotis' Disney Springs wine bar is known for its delicious small plates and expertly curated wine list. Make a meal of shareable like the saganaki on fire crispy mac and cheese bites and grilled romaine cheese and charcuterie boards. Or save room for the entrees and family-style plates of skirt steak or grilled whole Greek sea bass.

Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar

If you're a sucker for Disney-theming Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar is your best bet at Disney Springs. Disney-owned and operated the Indiana Jones-themed airplane-hangar-turned-watering hole is packed with Easter eggs from the films the Disney Springs' Adventurers Club past and S.E.A. lore.

Take in the details before sitting at a table on the waterfront terrace and ordering from a heavily themed menu of shareables such as the loaded pretzel Fountain of Youth chicken wings and Doctor Astorga's queso fundido plus a selection of flatbreads and tacos. An equally creative cocktail menu keeps regulars coming back again and again.

The Boathouse

Waterfront outdoor dining plays right into the charming maritime theming at The Boathouse which does surf and turf better than any other spot at Walt Disney World. Start with oysters on the falf shell from the raw bar peel and eat shrimp or main lobster bisque followed by a Maine style lobster roll or award-winning burger. Or go all out with a Gibsons heritage steak and Maine lobster tail add-on.

By Devin Watkins

Marking the 69th World Leprosy Day on Sunday Cardinal Michael Czerny has expressed the Church’s solidarity with people who live with Hansen’s Disease.

The Prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development sent a message to Church leaders and all people of good will reflecting on the theme chosen for this year’s commemoration: “United in Dignity”.

The Cardinal noted that leprosy has been on the decline since a multidrug therapy was introduced in the 1980s but said the tropical disease is still devastating and neglected.

“Beyond the daunting physical challenges associated with leprosy the discouraging reality of stigma remains a formidable obstacle to total health and healing.”

Over the past year over 127000 cases of Hansen’s Disease were reported with many cases leading to long-term complications.

Around 3-4 million people live with the visible impairments or deformities due to the disease according to the World Health Organization.

‘United in Dignity’

Cardinal Czerny affirmed the right of people with leprosy to live in dignity without discrimination.

He said stigma negatively affects the whole person demeaning their spiritual and physical aspects.

“People with leprosy often bear a double burden; not only do they have to cope with the physical reality of the disease but ‘many people with leprosy experience anxiety depression psychological distress isolation and suicidal ideation.’”

Fruitful creativity

The Cardinal also recalled Pope Francis’ encyclical Fratelli tutti in which he urges everyone to embrace the suffering of our brothers and sisters and not remain indifferent.

“It is our common human dignity that knits us together as one. Jesus Christ teaches us this significant reality by His words and even more so by His example.”

The Covid-19 pandemic noted Cardinal Czerny has made accessing healthcare even more difficult. However he added “no pandemic can change the dignity of the human person nor his or her inviolable worth and value in society”.

Being united in dignity said the Cardinal will result in fruitful creativity “that enables communities and individuals to recognize the value of every person especially those who suffer from illness and disability.”

God-given value

Cardinal Czerny wrapped up his message for World Leprosy Day with a reminder that the medicine and technology to treat Hansen’s Disease exists and should be made more available to those who need it.

“May Our Lady Help of the Sick continue to intercede for us that we may recognize in all persons that unique dignity and value that God has entrusted to the human family” he prayed.

Listen to our report",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMixQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGx0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tZXRyby9hZG1pbmlzdHJhdG9ycy1wdXNoLXdoZWVsY2hhaXJzLWFjY291bnRhbnRzLWVtcHR5LXRyYXNoLXN0LWxvdWlzLWhvc3BpdGFscy1hc2stZXZlcnktZW1wbG95ZWUtdG8tcGl0Y2gtaW4vYXJ0aWNsZV9hNTA1Mzk4Ni0yODZjLTVmZjItYWMwYS1kNmUxZmE3NmFjMDQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Administrators push wheelchairs accountants empty trash; St. Louis hospitals ask every employee to pitch in,"ST. LOUIS — Katie Horton has worked virtually from her home in Ballwin throughout the pandemic. But over the past two weeks she has spent her weekends and evenings scrubbing patient rooms and assisting nurses caring for COVID-19 patients at Mercy South Hospital.

Horton 49 is a talent selection manager for Mercy helping hire all the nonclinical positions such as food service public safety and clerical within the multistate hospital system.

Two weeks ago she answered a plea from Mercy asking employees to leave office chairs and help front-line hospital workers overwhelmed and weakened by the new COVID-19 variant.

“It was eye-opening. I work from home. I’ve been very safe through it all and that has certainly been a blessing” she said. “I just felt like it was good to be able to see through the eyes of the person doing these jobs.”

In an effort to maintain patient care during a record-breaking surge of COVID-19 patients health systems across Missouri are asking all employees to pick up shifts helping nurses by doing things like grabbing supplies or answering phones or by filling absences in areas such housekeeping and patient transport.

“Hospital administrators are pushing wheelchairs accountants are emptying trash cans and marketing professionals are serving meals — whatever it takes to make sure that our co-workers who provide hands-on patient care are able to focus on their patients” said Steve Mackin Mercy’s incoming president.

Whether they are called “Team 19” at CoxHealth in Springfield Missouri or “shared-service employees” at BJC HealthCare in the St. Louis area hundreds of office and outpatient employees are switching roles and offering to work extra inside hospitals. Many do so after working their regular jobs earning some extra pay.

In late December the hyper-infectious omicron variant caused a sharp spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations which peaked at the highest level in the St. Louis region on Jan. 17. The disease swept through staff just as quickly causing large numbers to have to stay home while they cared for themselves or their family members.

It is a crushing blow to a workforce already severely strained by the nearly two-year-long pandemic.

Though COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have been trending lower in the St. Louis area for nearly two weeks the number of patients and deaths remain near the highest levels in the pandemic.

“Our hospitals remain full our emergency departments are full and there’s not a lot of room in our (intensive care units) either” said Dr. Alex Garza co-director of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force. “So although this is improving many of our staff continue to be out because of COVID or because they are taking care of a loved one or a child whose school has unfortunately closed because of COVID.”

Misty Jones vice president of operations for SSM Health St. Louis said even nonclinical tasks such taking a patient to get an X-ray or delivering meals are being done by nurses and other front-line providers.

“If there’s not enough dining and nutrition staff because patients have to eat that work falls on nursing to make sure those trays get passed in a timely manner” Jones said.

Worried about the physical and mental exhaustion among workers leaders hope that others stepping up to help also boosts morale.

“This is the tide-turn at this point. They have struggled but they have managed but they can’t do this alone” Jones said. “This is a show of force of the system leaning in and saying we are here to help you. We see you we want to help. It is reaching out with empathy being present with our front-line staff and saying you are not alone.”

Chaos every shift

Lisa Nesler works at an outpatient infusion center at Mercy’s large Clayton-Clarkson clinic in Ballwin. She administers intravenous medications such as chemotherapy for cancer patients. She’s a registered nurse but she hasn’t worked inside a hospital in 18 years she said.

When she saw a request for help Nesler 54 of Chesterfield said the need was too great to ignore. She didn’t expect to get assigned to help in the emergency department at Mercy St. Louis.

“I thought ‘Oh my gosh what did I just get myself into?’” Nesler said. “I think my heart rate was 150 when I was walking into that building.”

When she arrived for her eight-hour shift at 7 a.m. the waiting room was packed. Patients had been waiting six to eight hours to get admitted to a room. Some were angry.

Her assignment was to draw blood from patients in triage which she did the entire shift. “I stopped counting after 30” she said. She was surprised what a great day it turned out to be.

“What really struck me was how kind and appreciative the staff were” Nesler said. “I just left that day feeling so good that I really helped the people that I went in to help.”

Katie Kluesner 25 of Washington Missouri was working in the emergency department that day. Kluesner has been an emergency room nurse for three years. During this latest surge she ends up crying in her car after her shifts. Or she goes home and collapses in bed.

“We’ll have 40 or 50 people out there (waiting) and they just keep coming” Kluesner said. “So the triage process just keeps going and we are constantly behind.”

With Nesler’s help Kluesner was able to put in orders for laboratory tests while she drew blood. That helped physicians see patients faster. It also helped to more quickly identify patients who were sicker and needed to move up in the line to see a doctor.

“You just know you are walking into complete chaos every shift so having people help us do these little tasks really takes a load off” Kluesner said.

Nesler also worked in a surgical trauma unit where she was able to feed dress and bathe patients or help them take a walk. She spent most of her time with one confused patient who kept trying to get out of bed. Nesler brushed his teeth combed his hair and shaved his face.

“All those little things take so much time” she said. “It just made me feel really good to do those things for those patients and help the staff do all those things they don’t always have time to do.”

A Band-Aid

Jon Bray is a senior performance improvement consultant at BJC HealthCare’s Barnes-Jewish Hospital. He meets virtually or in-person with directors in different units coaching them on everything from improving infection rates to how to communicate better with staff or work a new computer program.

Bray constantly reminds the directors of the hospital’s mission to provide world-class care. When the call came out to help the strained hospital system “I thought this is something I need to do” he said.

Bray 33 of St. Louis has worked four four-hour shifts at Barnes-Jewish Hospital over the past few weeks donning purple scrubs for employees in training cleaning elevators and stairwells wiping tables and taking out trash in the café.

“At first I thought this is nothing I’m just cleaning an elevator” Bray said. But as he cleaned the floor of food wrappers discarded masks and even spit he realized how important the work was in making families feel comfortable.

“I would hate for a family member to come in and see this and think that that represents our hospital because it doesn’t” he said. “I know even more so now than before how valuable the work is.”

Lisa Witzel 47 of south St. Louis County works in the safety and quality department at SSM Health DePaul Hospital reviewing reports and pouring over data. She took the job in July leaving her career as an emergency room nurse.

Offering to assist in the emergency department allowed her to get back and help those she remains close through a tough time.

“I still feel for my people that are still in the middle of it” Witzel said. “Anything I can do to help them out even if it’s small I know it’s helpful because I’ve been in their shoes.”

Hospital leaders say they imagine the assistance programs will last about another month and gradually phase out as hospitalizations and staffing levels stabilize.

Carla Ashmead oversees the program for BJC HealthCare as the director of patient care and operations. She said it’s been a much-needed Band-Aid on a bleeding system.

Ashmead said “Anytime that you can decrease the workload of the team it’s definitely a morale booster. Is it perfect? No but it does help make things better.”

A tiny gesture

Horton who left her virtual home office in Ballwin started out working side-by-side with housekeeping workers at Mercy South in the evenings. They prepared rooms for new patients. Horton stripped linens took out trash mopped floors disinfected every surface and restocked items.

Some wondered why she was there if someone was making her do it. “No I just heard you all need help and I work a job where I’m able to come in the evening and help out” Horton told them.

Another felt uneasy about making her mop floors she said but she insisted and asked them to show her if she wasn’t doing it right.

As one worker was ending her shift she told the next co-worker starting “This lady can help you. She’s really nice.”

That made Horton feel like they knew she genuinely wanted to pitch in.

“Hopefully they see people care and appreciate and understand how much they give of themselves each and every day” she said.

Horton also worked eight hours on a Saturday and four on a Sunday assisting nurses in units with critically ill patients many of whom had COVID-19.

When the nurses were inside a COVID-19 patient’s room Horton would get them things they needed such as patient gowns or gloves or even another nurse. That saved them from having to throw away personal protective equipment and don new ones each time they left and entered a room.

Horton answered patient call lights. She cleaned counters restocked supplies and helped a transporter by carrying the personal items of a patient leaving in a wheelchair with an oxygen tank.

It was humbling she said. She watched as nurses hugged family members of a patient who died. She watched them put off telling a patient her husband had died so she wouldn’t lose the will to live.

“Those are just two examples and I just think how they do this day in and day out” Horton said. “I was just in awe of their emotional mental and physical tenacity the armor that they probably wear daily to do their job and the compassion.”

Horton also cleaned their break room wiping up coffee spills organizing the condiments throwing away trash and making the tables shine. It seemed like a tiny gesture but maybe it would feel a little nicer the next time they had a moment to sit down.

A nurse later stopped Horton and asked if she was the one who had cleaned the room. “Oh my god thank you!” the nurse told her.

“No no no” Horton said. “Thank you for what you are doing day in and day out.”

The historian and royal expert 48 was a a guest on ‘Michael McIntyre’s The Wheel’ on BBC One last night. The hit Saturday night game show sees members of the public take on a spinning wheel of categories as they compete for a cash prize. Contestants are assisted by seven famous faces each week who are each an expert in their chosen field. Joining Lucy will be Peter Andre Rob Beckett Patricia Bright Richard Coles John Barnes and Ashley Roberts.

Lucy is chief curator at Historic Royal Palaces the charity that manages some of the UK’s unoccupied royal buildings. She is also an acclaimed author and well-known for presenting history documentaries on the BBC. As well as researching the history of the British monarchy the question has been raised of whether Lucy is related to the royal bloodline herself. The suggestion is that the historian is related to Katharine Duchess of Kent who is married to the Duke of Kent the Queen’s cousin. The link owes to Lucy’s surname ‘Worsley’ which she shares with the Duchess whose maiden name was Katharine Lucy Mary Worsley.

Lucy Worsley: TV presenter and historian

The Duke and Duchess of Kent have three children: George Earl of St Andrews Lady Helen Taylor and Lord Nicholas Windsor. However Lucy is not related to them as she confirmed during a throwback question and answer session for The Guardian in 2017. The historian was asked: “Have you ever researched the history of your family and if you have do you have a favourite ancestor?” In her response she poured cold water on claims she was related to the Royal Family and admitted her own ancestry was “disappointing”. She said: “My family history is very disappointing.

She said: “We are a microcosm of the changes in family dynamics in general – from a nuclear family to a large messy blended one.” Step-families she argued are not a modern concept but have in fact been a part of life since before the Industrial Revolution. Lucy added: “People think this is new but the idea of the nuclear family didn’t come along until the 1850s when the Industrial Revolution created enough money for a man to be able to support his wife and children.

Cunard: Photos Show Which Cruise to Pick for Luxury Fun,"While both cruise lines are owned by The Carnival Corporation they are vastly different.

Cunard is Britain's high-end cruise line and is known for luxury and its links to royalty. The Queen Mother Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth II all visited Cunard ships over the years and the Queen Elizabeth ship was even named after the royal herself.

The cruise line mostly caters to older guests. A Cunard spokesperson told Insider that the average age of its guests is 61.

On Carnival Cruises the theme is fun. Carnival's ships are nicknamed the ""fun ships"" and the brand is seen as more of a budget-friendly option in the cruising industry according to Cruise Critic.

CASCADE Idaho — The fourth annual Idaho Sled Dog Challenge will make its return on Jan. 30 and run until Feb. 3.

The event is one of the many featured at the McCall Winter Carnival and will take place at the Lake Cascade boat ramp between the Lakeshore Bar & Grill and the Van Wyck Campground.

The race is considered one of the most grueling mushing competitions in the world due to its topography according to Dave Looney one of the primary volunteers and spokespersons for the event.

""Mushers will tell you this is a very very atypical race"" Looney said. ""Our elevation change is 36000 feet which is greater than the Iditarod. They call it a 500-mile race packed into 300 miles. So the dog care and the pacing and the attention they have to pay to the terrain is really important because there's a lot of up and down. One musher said the Idaho Sled Dog Challenge is like climbing Mt. Everest -- twice.""

The Idaho Sled Dog Challenge (ISDC) is the only 300-mile Yukon Quest qualifier in the contiguous continental U.S. and one of the three such events for the Iditarod in the lower 48. It is also viewed as one of the longest and toughest sled dog races in the world.

The race is part of the Rocky Mountain Triple Crown which includes the Eagle Cap Extreme in Joseph Oregon and the Race to the Sky near Helena Montana.

In addition to the 300-mile Iditarod and the Yukon Quest qualifier this year's event also features a 100-mile race for those newer to the sport. The Junior race will not be taking place this year organizers said.

Jerry Wortley event founder and organizer said this year's mushers include top-notch Iditarod and Yukon Quest veterans including the 2020 ISDC 300-mile-race champion Jessie Royer.

Teams from across seven different states are participating in this year's race including the first mushing team from east of the Mississippi Gregg and Bailey Vitello a father and son duo from Milan N.H. The remaining mushers come from Colorado Montana Oregon and Washington.

Six Idahoans are listed on this year's roster: Jed Stephensen from Sandpoint Jacob McCowan from Priest River Jeneen Loeliger-Myers from McCall Elizabeth Nevills from Middleton and a father-daughter duo Bryce and Anna Mumford from Preston.

Spectators can follow along with the race by day online and GPS sled trackers by night; or by visiting any of the five road-accessible checkpoints.

""Watching and cheering for the teams along the trail as they arrive and depart the checkpoints and witnessing firsthand how the mushers care for their dogs as they get some much-deserved rest is an unforgettable experience"" Wortley said.

Free race events open to the public:

Vet checks and meet the mushers - Jan. 30 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Lake Cascade boat ramp between Lakeshore Bar & Grill and the Van Wyck Campground

300-mile start - Jan. 31 at 1 p.m. at the Lake Cascade boat ramp

100-mile race start - Feb. 1 at 1 p.m. at the Lake Cascade boat ramp

100-mile race finish - early morning Feb. 2 at the Wye Trailhead & Campground checkpoint off U.S. Route 95 about 6 miles west of New Meadows (turn east on Tamarack View Dr. at the Wye Trailhead sign)

300-mile race finish - Feb. 3 from early morning to midday at the Lake Cascade boat ramp

There is no event parking at the Lake Cascade checkpoint so organizers have arranged for busses to shuttle spectators there from a nearby parking area. Wortley says to plan to arrive early and catch a bus which run about every 20 minutes.

Volunteers are still needed and can sign up on through the website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJvZ2Vyc3ZpbGxlcmV2aWV3LmNvbS9yb2dlcnN2aWxsZS9hcnRpY2xlXzY1YzZlYWUwLTA2MWUtNWQ2Zi05YjgzLWJjMGRlY2ViZDQ1YS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biting off more than we can chew: Excellent food and ambiance at the Carnival Cafe,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Perhaps you just off an international flight and your iPhone is simply not detecting any available networks? In such cases manual network selection may be required to access cellular services once again.

By default network selection is completely automatic on iPhones and it works just fine most of the time. However sometimes when you exit Airplane mode your iPhone may show “No Service” after looking for a cellular signal. Moreover if you’re traveling to a foreign country you may need to first check the network providers that your carrier has partnered with for international roaming and then manually switch to that network upon arrival.

How to Manually Select Cellular Carrier Network on iPhone

Regardless of the iOS software that your iPhone is running you can follow the steps below to manually choose your network provider on your iPhone.

Head over to “Settings” from the home screen of your iPhone.



In the settings menu scroll down and tap on “Cellular” to proceed.



Next choose the “Network Selection” option located below the Personal Hotspot setting as shown in the screenshot below.



Here you’ll see that network selection is set to Automatic. Tap once on the toggle to change it to manual.



You’ll need to wait for a few seconds for all the available networks to show up. Now simply select your carrier or partnered network provider for international roaming and you’re good to go.





There you go. You’ve successfully managed to access cellular services again thanks to manual selection.

Once you’ve manually selected the network provider using the above steps you can tap the toggle to re-enable automatic selection again. You won’t be disconnected from your connected network by doing this.

It’s important to note that you can only successfully connect to your SIM card’s network or the carrier that your provider has partnered with for roaming. If you select any other networks from the manual selection menu your iPhone will try connecting and end up showing “No Service” again.

The network providers that your carrier may have partnered with may vary based on the country you’re traveling to so it’s best to check those details while you plan for your trip. For example EE one of UK’s biggest network providers is partnered with AT&T in the USA for LTE connectivity. The easiest way would be to contact your carrier’s customer service regarding all this information.

We hope you were able to successfully connect to your carrier network using manual selection without any trouble. What are your thoughts on this alternate method for selecting your network provider?

The crash of a US F-35C stealth fighter jet in the South China Sea continues to be a much-discussed topic in Chinese social media platforms after the US navy confirmed the authenticity of footage and photographs of the accident. Netizens and experts said it indicates technical and operational problems as well as loose management and exhaustion in the US military despite the country's desire to flaunt its military might against China.On Monday the day after a US dual aircraft carrier group entered the South China Sea an F-35C stealth fighter jet crashed and then fell into the sea after trying to land on the USS Carl Vinson one of the carriers.It is the first known crash of F-35C one of most advanced stealth fighter jets in the world and each one is reportedly worth $100 million.A still photograph and a 14-second video about the accident circulated in the global media on Friday. The photograph shows the plane floating on the surface of the South China Sea its cockpit open after the pilot had ejected. The F-35 can also be seen on its landing approach to the aircraft carrier but the footage cuts off before the plane hits the flight deck.A spokesperson for the US Navy's 7th Fleet said Friday that an investigation into the incident is ongoing and the images that have emerged on social media since the crash are genuine CNN reported.""The ship has assessed that the video and photo covered by the media today were taken on board USS Carl Vinson ... during the crash"" Commander Hayley Sims public affairs officer for the 7th Fleet was quoted as saying by CNN.The footage is short but it shows that the aircraft is very close to the aircraft carrier after finishing the last turn which leaves little time for the pilot to adjust flying position Wang Yanan chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine told the Global Times on Saturday.Such a landing method is rare in normal training and is more likely to be applied during combat or when something goes wrong with the aircraft according to experts.""Maybe the pilot was trying to show off but messed it up… no zuo no die why you try"" a user of China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo commented on Saturday.""No zuo no die"" is a Chinese internet meme that means ""one would not be in trouble had one not asked for it.""""Maybe it is just the US navy testing a new amphibious fighter in the South China Sea"" another netizen commented.Some netizens wondered how such a confidential matter could have been leaked and circulated in the global media as it is an embarrassment for the US navy.Others said the accident might be a conspiracy by the US military so that they can stay in the South China Sea for longer and even explore the topography in the area.The operation to recover the F-35C from the bottom of the South China Sea could take up to 120 days media reports said citing US military officials.Experts reached by the Global Times said the US would not have wanted to put itself in such an embarrassing position especially while trying to flex its muscles on the doorstep of China. The leak of the footage of the crash also shows loose management in the US navy they noted.Some explanations for the accident have been suggested. First the landing speed was too high which meant that the landing gear broke; second the landing was not in the correct position. Only one of the plane's wheels touched the deck so that the F-35C tilted and fell off the ship Fu Qianshao a Chinese military aviation expert told the Global Times on Saturday.It might have been because the aircraft carrier was shaking or the aircraft just targeted the wrong landing site according to Fu.More details will be needed to figure out the real cause of the accident. But the fact that the aircraft could be seen floating for a while shows that it smacked onto the surface of the sea rather than heading down directly Fu said.However Wang Yanan noted that the US military will probably not release more details of the investigation as it would involve a lot of confidential information concerning the US navy's combat capacity such as the training level of their pilots the management level on the US aircraft carriers and some technical details.It is also possible that the flight engaged the arresting cable but it then got unhooked. In this case the cable would kick back and hurt the ground staff Wang said.Such an accident would mean that the deck of the aircraft carrier would temporarily lose its work capacity. If this happened during combat the carrier would be a vulnerable target Wang noted.""No matter what the reason is the accident shows that the US military has some problems with training"" a military expert told the Global Times on condition of anonymity echoing Wang.The expert also noted that the pilot was probably not concentrating enough when trying to land on the deck so that he failed to correct course in time. The US has carried out numerous exercises in waters near China so this accident will put a lot of psychological pressure on the pilots and reduce their operational efficiency the expert noted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1cnJpeWV0ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS90dXJraXNoLWFpcmxpbmVzLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtcmVzaHVmZmxlZC1hZnRlci1jaGFpci1yZXNpZ25lZC0xNzExMTPSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5odXJyaXlldGRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3R1cmtpc2gtYWlybGluZXMtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1yZXNodWZmbGVkLWFmdGVyLWNoYWlyLXJlc2lnbmVkLTE3MTExMw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turkish Airlines management reshuffled after chair resigned,"Turkish Airlines management reshuffled after chair resigned

ISTANBUL

The top management of Turkey’s flag carrier Turkish Airlines was overhauled on Jan. 27 after three members of its board and executive committee including chairperson İlker Aycı resigned from their posts.

Ahmet Bolat has been appointed new chairman of Turkish Airlines’ board and executive committee a statement after a board meeting on Jan. 27 said.

Aycı had been the chairman of the carrier since April 2015. After joining Turkish Airlines in 2005 at the strategy development department Bolat had been the chief investment and technology officer at the company since 2012.

Born in the Central Anatolian province of Konya in 1959 Bolat graduated from Istanbul Tecnical University in 1981 as an industrial engineer. In 1984 he graduated from M.Sc. Operations Research Program at Stanford University and in 1988 he obtained his Ph.D. in industrial and operations engineering from the University of Michigan. He has also been the deputy chairman of the Turkish Aerospace Inc since May 2018.

“I would like to extend my thanks to board members for entrusting this duty to me. I am well aware of the responsibilities and duties it brings along with its significance” Bolat said.

Meanwhile captain pilot Mehmet Kadaifciler and Şekib Avdagiç the head of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce were also appointed new board and executive committee members. They replaced Mehmet Muzaffer Akpınar and Mithat Görkem Aksoy.

Turkiye’s flag carrier Turkish Airlines established in 1933 flies to 334 worldwide destinations in 128 countries with a fleet of 373 aircraft.

The cargo business has helped Turkish Airlines weather the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic Aycı said on Jan. 17.

“We learned from the past crises. When I took helm of the company in 2015 my initial plans included the expansion of the cargo business. During the 2016 crisis I came to the understanding that a bigger crisis management plan was needed” he told private broadcaster CNN Türk.

Aycı recalled that the losses of the global airline industry amounted to $360 billion in 2020 and in the second year of the pandemic those losses stood at between $80 billion and $90 billion. “But THY managed to post profit in three quarters.”

The company’s financials show that in the first nine months of 2021 Turkish Airlines’ revenues were $7.4 billion while revenues from the cargo operations soared 125 percent compared with the same period of 2019 to $2.7 billion. The carrier’s nine-month net income was $734 million.

In a filing with Borsa Istanbul earlier this month Turkish Airlines disclosed that it delivered 1.9 million tons of cargo and mail in the whole of 2021 up 22 percent from 2019.

Last year Turkish Airlines served a total of 44.8 million passengers. It carried some 25 million international travelers while the domestic passenger tally was 20.1 million people.

Aycı was also honored with the CEO Lifetime Achievement Award the first time such an achievement was awarded to a European aviation leader in the history of the awards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHZpbGxhZ2VzcGFjZS5jb20vd2F0Y2gtdXMtbW9zdC1leHBlbnNpdmUtZmlnaHRlci1qZXQtY3Jhc2hlcy1pbi1zb3V0aC1jaGluYS1zZWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch: US most expensive fighter jet crashes in South China Sea,"A video has surfaced online showing one of the most advanced US fighter jets the F-35C Lightning II crashing into the deck of an aircraft carrier in the South China Sea. The footage along with a photo showing the wreckage of the aircraft floating in the sea was confirmed to be authentic by the US Navy in a statement to CNN.

The F-35C fighter jet could be seen approaching the deck of USS ‘Carl Vinson’ from afar in the video which was recorded on board the carrier. A loud bang could be heard and a plume of white smoke starts to appear before the clip cuts off.

The wreckage of the plane drifting in the waters of the South China Sea was captured in a photo which was also leaked online.

Speaking to CNN the US Navy confirmed the authenticity of the footage.

“The ship has assessed that the video and photo covered by media today were taken onboard USS ‘Carl Vinson’… during the crash” Cmdr. Hayley Sims told the outlet on Friday.

The spokesperson noted that the investigation into what led to the crash is still underway along with efforts to recover the wreckage which is now at the bottom of the South China Sea – a disputed waterway which is claimed almost in its entirety by China.

There have been reports in the US media that Washington is racing to recover the $100 million aircraft fearing that it would be salvaged and subsequently claimed by Beijing. However China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian stated on Thursday that Beijing has “no interest in their aircraft” while urging Washington “to do things that are conducive to regional peace and stability rather than flex muscles in the region.”

In fact there are few listed caterpillars that feed on gingko leaves and few pollinators that visit the male pollen cones. It is wind pollinated so it doesn’t need a pollinator to help spread the pollen.

The concern from many readers (again I truly appreciate your emails and perspectives) was that this is not a good recommendation as a tree to be used to help with the plight of our pollinators. Oaks are the preferred species since so many caterpillars feed on them resulting in the survival of many species of butterflies.

I like to remind people that we all have different philosophies when it comes to gardening horticulture and landscapes. I have my own philosophy that is guided by research-based scientific information.

I also have my opinions about plants that I like don’t like (there are very few other than invasive species) and wouldn’t plant in my landscape. You also have your own likes and dislikes.

For instance I am not totally against pesticides and I will recommend them in some cases. Others are totally against pesticides and would never use them.

However when I use a pesticide I have gone through a rigorous process including identifying the specific pest selecting the right solution which could be cultural and not chemical.

If I do use chemicals I will select the “softest” product that won’t kill beneficial insects and I follow directions specifically to prevent damage to pollinators.

So back to planting for pollinators. I do take care of the pollinators in my landscape and in my teaching.

I have written several columns over the years regarding pollinators their plight reducing pesticides and more. I always incorporate information about pollinators in my teaching when appropriate.

In my own landscape I have room for cultivated plants and trees such as the gingko as well as native plant species.

I have a black cherry which is the host for many pollinators as well as Carolina allspice the species coneflower many other native perennial species and several oaks.

My philosophy when it comes to our landscapes and gardens is for everyone to plant something that will help pollinators. Even if it’s just one plant in their flower beds or a tree or shrub.

The challenge for pollinators is that there are so many places that have been developed either commercially or into suburbs that don’t have plants for pollinators.

Therefore if we all do our part and plant SOMETHING for the pollinators it will connect those areas that are already planted hopefully leading to improved habitat for pollinators.

I hope that those of you who were unhappy with me writing about the gingko understand my philosophy and give me grace for it. I also hope that you understand I only have so many inches in this column to explain topics.

Rudolph a member of the Springfield Sports Hall of Fame as well as the Greater Peoria Sports Hall of Fame died on Jan. 19 at OSF St. Francis Medical Center in Peoria.

The 1946 Lanphier High School graduate will be buried at Calvary Cemetery in Springfield on Monday following a visitation and funeral service in Peoria on Saturday. She was 93 years old.

“She was such an outstanding not only player but an outstanding person” said former teammate friend and neighbor Beverly Brown. “There was never anything at all that you could ask her to do that she would refuse to do it.

“It didn't matter if it was to run an errand for you or loan you $5000 without any papers being signed. She was just an absolute perfect person. I can't say enough about her. She's just been a wonderful person to know.”

After starting to play fast-pitch softball in 1941 Rudolph moved to East Peoria and joined the Caterpillar Dieselettes softball team in 1947. It didn’t take long to impress former teammate and longtime friend Lorene Ramsey said.

“She had the ability to look at hitters and know where we should pitch them” Ramsey said “and the ability to talk to the umpires and sometimes get the strike zone widened because she had a great ability at conversation.

“And she was a good hitter one of our best hitters in the No. 3 spot most of the time and had a good arm. People didn't run on her.”

Going from Sangamon County to Tazewell County wasn’t her only move. After three seasons at shortstop Rudolph moved to catcher.

“The gal that had been catching was going into education” Rudolph told The State Journal-Register in 2015. “I said I’d take it. It guaranteed me a spot in the starting lineup.”

The Lettes — as they were known after Caterpillar dropped its sponsorship — turned into one of the nation's top women’s fast-pitch softball teams with Rudolph on the roster.

The franchise dates back to 1930 and according to its website Rudolph remains the all-time leader in triples is second in base hits doubles and RBIs and is third in stolen bases at-bats runs scored and seventh in home runs. In 1955 she hit .381 and averaged .285 in her career.

Rudolph played with the Lettes for 19 years and stayed through the moves to Sunnyland in 1956 and to Pekin in 1959. She retired as a player after the 1964 season but not before she was named Springfield’s “outstanding girl athlete” for the decade of 1947-57.

Rudolph was ushered into the Illinois Amateur Softball Association Hall of Fame in 1974 then the Greater Peoria Sports Hall of Fame in 1989. Her hometown of Springfield welcomed her into its hall of fame in 2015.

In 1982 Rudolph and Ramsey were reunited on a softball field when Rudolph became Ramsey’s hitting coach at Illinois Central College. The team captured the National Junior College Athletic Association championship that same year and again in 1998.

“The kids just loved her because she had the gift of gab” Ramsey recalled. “And she could she always was a good hitter at taking the ball to right field on an outside pitch and she could demonstrate it. And some of them actually picked it up.”

Though her playing career ended before the landmark 1972 Title IX was passed which helped women gain equal opportunities in athletics Rudolph told The State Journal-Register the Lettes had some stellar accommodations.

“Our career was unbelievable” Rudolph said. “It was a real major league operation for women. We had our own ball field. We had our own clubhouse and clubhouse manager. We traveled all around ... Florida California Oregon Texas Canada and along the East Coast.”

Ramsey said the team was very popular.

“We never had a losing season and not anything even close to it” Ramsey said. “But once we got to Pekin … the sports editor in Pekin ... decided to make us a feature.

“We drew 120000 fans one year at home and the Cleveland Indians had just barely gone over 200000. And we played much fewer games. We were averaging more spectators and they were at that time.”

The Pekin Lettes still meet once a month for dinner Ramsey said. Rudolph was at the December meeting. The team members often wear their red softball shirts to the monthly dinners. Ramsey said the team will also wear them at Rudolph’s services.

Brown said Rudolph long feared water but eventually moved next door to Brown on the banks of the Illinois River outside of Peoria. Before long Rudolph’s fears had vanished.

“(Rudolph) didn't want anything to do with a river” Brown said with a chuckle. “And when she moved out here within six months she had bought herself a pontoon boat and was just one of them running up and down the river like somebody that lived on it all her life.

“(She) absolutely loved — loved — the water. Loved the river.”

FERGUSON Mo. — New developments are coming to West Florissant Avenue through efforts lead by the Urban League.

""When people see vacant abandoned lots that they know used to be businesses it adds to the thought that a community is dying"" Urban League President Michael McMillan said.

He believes Ferguson has come a long way since the uprisings from the Michael Brown shooting in 2014 but he says there's still more work to be done.

""When you look at St. Louis and you look at what happened in Ferguson sadly what it did was it exposed the worst of us to the entire world and so we will always be judged on what we did and did not do in Ferguson"" McMillan said.

That's why he's leading efforts to purchase and develop three vacant properties on West Florissant Avenue.

""We worked with the county looked at the neighborhood driven plan of what they wanted to see in the area and then purchased those three lots with the help of Centene Corporation and Emerson and then now are beginning to implement what the community said they want to see"" McMillan said.

The properties are about half a mile up the street from the Urban League on West Florissant.

There will be a new city plaza and across the street they plan to break ground on a new senior center in just about six weeks.

""All told this will be about a $25 million infusion between these three projects and then also the staffing and the funding that we spend every year to continue to operate for the benefit of the community out here in Ferguson and Dellwood and North County"" McMillan said.

They're holding a virtual town hall on February 3rd to discuss the plans organize clean-up efforts and hear input from neighbors.

""The community needs to see action. They need to see that people still care that Ferguson Dellwood and North County have not been forgotten"" McMillan said.

The senior citizen building will have 44 units for housing and a senior center.

The city plaza will have a First Bank banquet hall and a restaurant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2FtYW5kYS13aWxsaWFtcy1vYml0dWFyeT9waWQ9MjAxMjgxNjQ20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amanda Williams Obituary - Death Notice and Service Information,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/amanda-williams-obituary?pid=201281646 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2FtYW5kYS13aWxsaWFtcy1vYml0dWFyeT9waWQ9MjAxMjgxNjQ20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

According to a press release from Deputy Fire Chief Dallas Davis Sidney Fire was dispatched to a report of a structure fire at 1042 Apple Blossom Lane at 10:24 p.m Saturday Jan. 29 2022. Upon arrival crews found a single-family residence with fire showing from the front porch and vented through the roof. The occupants were outside advising all occupants were out of the house except one dog.

Engine #3 crew initiated transitional fire attack from the front porch. Quint #2 crew pulled a back-up line and conducted search of division 1. The fire crews extinguished the fire and found the dog unharmed. The dog was reunited with the family.

A box alarm was established for all off duty personnel to respond along with mutual aid from Anna Lockington and Piqua Fire Departments for assistance. Due to the cold temperatures and road conditions the city of Sidney Street Department also responded with a salt truck.

AES (formerly DP&L) Center Point Energy (formerly Vectren) responded to the scene to control the utilities.

The fire caused heavy damage to the structure. The damage to the property is estimated at $35000 to the structure and $15000 to the contents.

The occupants were displaced by the fire incident. The American Red Cross was contacted to assist the occupants.

No fire personnel were injured during the event.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Every year up to 3000 people flock to Davos Switzerland each paying $29000 (plus a huge membership fee) to attend the five-day World Economic Forum filled with panels jet planes and parties.

They come to rub shoulders with corporate executives heads of state venture capitalists hedge fund managers and A-list celebrities who together aim to “solve the great crises of the age” writes Peter S. Goodman in his new book “Davos Man: How the Billionaires Devoured the World” (Custom House) out now. It’s “an event where the interests of Bill Clinton Mick Jagger and Greta Thunberg all somehow intersect in time and space.”

Getting into Davos is impossibly complicated even for those lucky enough to score invites. First you must gain membership limited to just 1000 of the world’s biggest corporations which starts at $62000 per year and can run up to $620000 for “strategic partners.” (Government employees non-profits and media outlets get in for free.) The ski resort town has only so many hotel rooms with even bare-bones chalets going for more than $400 a night so some attendees must commute in from neighboring villages where accommodation is limited and going for absurdly inflated prices.

9 it all started in 1971. NY Post/Mike Guillen

As a result “the anxiety of exclusion pervades” journalist Nick Paumgarten once wrote about the scene. “The tension between self-celebration and self-doubt engenders a kind of social electricity.”

Hard to believe it all started in 1971 because Klaus Schwab a 33-year-old German economist and University of Geneva business policy professor wanted to teach US management practices to European firms.

Schwab grew up in Europe’s postwar reconstruction — his family left Germany for Switzerland to escape the Nazis — “steeped in the principles of social democracy” Goodman writes. While studying public administration at Harvard Schwab made friends with mentors like Henry Kissinger and John Kenneth Galbraith and came up with his “stakeholder theory” — the idea that a company should serve not just its shareholders but also its employees suppliers and community.

Schwab wanted a way to discuss these concepts with high-powered contacts on an annual basis so he started the event — originally called the European Management Forum. He chose Davos as its home base because “the remote and placid setting seemed conducive to a focused interchange of ideas.” The mountain village already had a colorful history — it hosted numerous tuberculosis sanatoriums for wealthy Europeans during the 1800s and Albert Einstein was a regular visitor in the early 1920s once giving a lecture on relativity to a summit of visiting academics.

The Forum’s first year attracted 450 people from dozens of countries and within a few years it had established a reputation for exclusivity. Schwab offered a way for CEOs and heads of state to meet and make deals over a few days which “would normally take months to pull off” Goodman told The Post. In 1987 Schwab changed the event’s name to the World Economic Forum and looked for ways to “distinguish itself from the run-of-the-mill business conferences where people sat around talking about money.” So he transformed it into “a demonstration of social concern” Goodman writes.

Today the Forum’s logo plainly spells out its mission: “Committed to Improving the State of the World.” It’s embossed on banners that hang on every street corner and meeting room in Davos during the festivities.

Unlike billionaires of past centuries like Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan who were “by and large satisfied with their wealth as an end in itself” the Davos Man wants more than the spoils of ridiculous affluence. He wants gratitude and validation that he’s doing his part to make the world a better place even if he’s doing nothing of the kind the author claims.

Goodman who’s attended every year as a journalist since 2010 calls the contrast between the Forum’s noble packaging and crude reality “surreal.”

He writes that he’s seen billionaires blindfolded and yelled at by angry officials in group exercises to simulate the Syrian refugee experience — and then afterwards nibble on truffles at dinners hosted by global banks. He has watched venture capitalists fresh out of panel discussions about human trafficking “fist-bumping over having scored invites to the bacchanal thrown by a Russian oligarch who flew in prostitutes from Moscow.”

‘A ludicrous character he displays faith in the veracity of his statements even when they are at odds with reality.’ Peter S. Goodman on Klaus Schwab founder of the World Economic Forum

During the 2020 gathering — the last time the Forum was held in person since the pandemic — the collective net worth of the attendees was $500 billion including President Trump. (The Forum will be returning to Davos again this May.) Today’s attendees — who are predominantly white and male — pose for photos with Matt Damon and congratulate Bill Gates on his philanthropic efforts while attending seminars about how to tackle global warming or economic inequality. They come for “earnest discussions on climate change gender imbalance and the digital future” but they often fail to “live up to their own lofty rhetoric” Goodman writes.

In 2020 Prince Charles gave an address to world leaders and billionaires at Davos urging them to get serious about saving the planet after flying there via private jet. An estimated 1500 individual private planes jetted into Davos for the Forum in 2019 up 11 percent from the previous year according to an analysis by the Air Charter Service. Andy Christie a private jets director for the ACS said in a statement that the increase was due to “business rivals not wanting to be seen to be outdone by one another.”

Marc Benioff the founder of Silicon Valley software giant Salesforce who spoke during a virtual panel at the 2021 Forum has long been one of the biggest proponents of the forum and Schwab in particular whose stakeholder theory he’s called “one of the greatest intellectual contributions to the world of business.”

Benioff perfectly encapsulates the Davos Man aesthetic Goodman writes. He earned his wealth not by privilege but by being “smarter and more innovative than the next guy. He is fine with handing over a little of his money but on his terms alone through branded philanthropic efforts and especially if it puts his name on a hospital wing or yields a photo of himself surrounded by grateful children in some wretched country made slightly less wretched by his generosity.”

During a 2020 interview with Goodman Benioff admitted: “Davos is not perfect but what is the alternative?”

If his focus on doing good was meant only for publicity Benioff argued then his employees would see through it. “They would go elsewhere gravitating toward companies that were genuinely infused with social purpose” Goodman writes.

Meanwhile it’s not just the Forum that’s become overblown over the decades. So has Schwab’s sense of self-importance. Now 83 he expects to be treated like a visiting head of state when he travels complete with “welcoming delegations at the airport” Goodman writes.

Once when a Forum employee inadvertently pulled into Schwab’s parking spot at the Forum’s world headquarters in Switzerland the boss caught wind of the insubordination and despite the fact he was overseas at the time demanded she be fired. He relented “only after senior staff intervened to save her” Goodman writes.

It didn’t help matters when during a Forum gathering in South Africa during the mid-1990s Schwab delivered an address in front of Nelson Mandela in which he borrowed heavily from Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington speech including at one point dramatically declaring “I have a dream.”

“Several of us almost threw up” recalled Barbara Erskine who then ran the Forum’s communications mortified that her boss was trying to pass off MLK’s famous words as his own. (Schwab didn’t respond to requests from The Post for comment.)

9 Schwab’s warm welcome of Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) at Davos in 2017 put a spotlight on the central irony of the Forum Goodman writes. AP

Schwab has often bragged to colleagues that he expected to receive a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Forum Goodman notes. He has yet to receive that honor.

But while he may be “something of a ludicrous character” he also has a special talent for catering to “the narcissistic tendencies of the powerful” Goodman writes. “He displays faith in the veracity of his statements even when they are at odds with reality and the ethos of the Forum.”

9 Schwab has often bragged to colleagues that he expected to receive a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Forum.

This has allowed Schwab to invite keynote speakers like China president Xi Jinping with his reputation for encouraging human trafficking and forced labor and brutally cracking down on dissent.

“In a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility the international community is looking to China to continue its responsive and responsible leadership” Schwab said while introducing the Chinese leader in 2017.

It was a moment that put a spotlight on the central irony of the Forum.

“The founding Davos Man was hosting an event crammed with lectures about transparent governance” Goodman writes. All while “bowing to a Chinese dictator.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The US oil and gas giant revealed late on Friday it had made an “accounting adjustment” on its non-operated 16.67 per cent stake in NWS because it no longer met the criteria for “assets held for sale”.

The ageing Woodside-operated asset is set to transition to a toll treatment facility over the coming years as its own gas reserves deplete.

Chevron’s chief executive officer Michael Wirth told analysts the company demanded value from any transaction and was not in a position where it needed to sell assets to generate cash.

“Obviously we’re in a market today where LNG demand is very high and there is a lot of gas in Australia still to run through these plants” he said.

“It’s a good asset to generate strong cashflow... and so it’s a nice part of our portfolio.”

Since Chevron flagged the sale of its NWS stake the project’s joint venture partners have struck commercial agreements with Japan’s Mitsui and the Kerry Stokes-backed Beach Energy and the Australian Gas Infrastructure Group to toll treat gas from the $768 million Waitsia gas project near Dongara and export it as LNG.

The deal came after the State Government granted an exemption to Waitsia from a ban on the exportation of onshore gas in August 2020 that aimed to ensure adequate future gas supplies for the WA market.

Premier Mark McGowan said at the time the exemption had been granted because the project was shovel ready.

Another onshore gas player Strike Energy has also expressed interest in securing an exemption for its South Erregulla field in the Perth Basin.

Woodside’s long-delayed Browse project off the Kimberley coast has also been slated as providing feed for the NWS.

Besides Woodside and Chevron other partners in the NWS project include BHP BP Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) and Shell with all parties holding an equal 16.67 per cent stake.

Woodside had originally been slated as a buyer of Chevron’s stake but is set to double its holding in the asset courtesy of its merger with BHP’s petroleum division.

Chevron flagged the sales process in June 2020 after saying it had received “a number of unsolicited approaches from a range of credible buyers”.

The accounting adjustment means Chevron recognises about $US200m in catch-up depreciation in its 2021 books over the past 18 months during which the asset was listed for sale.

Chevron is a foundational holder in the 35-year-old NWS project which is Australia’s oldest LNG project.

Myanmar has faced unrest since the army overthrew the elected government in February 2021 and detained its leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The junta has been accused of using brutal force to put down protests.

The Australian gas producer will now begin the formal procedure to exit exploration assets it holds with state-owned Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise and other entities including China National Petroleum Corp and Total.

“Given the situation in Myanmar we can no longer contemplate Woodside’s participation in the development of the A-6 gas resources nor other future activities in-country” Woodside Chief Executive Officer Meg O’Neill said on Thursday .

The company warned of a $138 million hit to its fiscal 2021 net profit after tax due to non-cash expenses associated with the withdrawal.

Woodside had said last February it would trim its presence in Myanmar following the coup https://www.reuters.com/world/china/myanmar-police-launch-most-extensive-crackdown-one-woman-shot-wounded-2021-02-27 and its complete exit comes after TotalEnergies and Chevron partners in a major gas project in Myanmar withdrew from the country last week citing the worsening humanitarian situation.

Filly starts out by talking Bell and bodybuilder Nsima Inyang through his technique for the single-arm kettlebell press which he then supersets with a trap bar deadlift ensuring that he keeps the movements slow and controlled. ""I'd want that set to take somewhere between 45 seconds and 55 seconds just on that arm"" he says ""so we're going to get around 90 seconds of time under tension on the press then we're going to deadlift for a minute straight so keep the tempo slow.""

""Tempo resistance training teaches people a little bit easier motor control mind-muscle connection"" he continues. ""That alone is going to protect people from their own mental worst enemy which is like 'I think I can lift the universe today' and they go in with sloppy technique and they hurt themselves.""

Filly then demonstrates some of his go-to ""functional pump conditioning"" work. Unlike with the previous lifts the goal here is to complete each round as quickly as possible but without sacrificing technique. ""To ensure we're not going too fast and losing form we pick exercises that specifically will slow you down by the nature of how you get in and out of them"" he says.

In this instance Filly chooses the dumbbell floor press going from 10 reps down to one the kettlebell swing and sled pull. ""If one of your greatest assets as an athlete is your strength"" he says ""then leverage it in these conditioning workouts so that you can get good cardiovascular work capacity but use things that you're really confident with to elevate and develop intensity.""

LFR said a lightning strike is suspected but not confirmed to be the cause of the fire.

According to the fire inspector’s initial estimate the fire caused $1.5 million in damage to the building with a large amount of the damage up in-between the roof and the ceiling.

A spokesperson for the church said on social media that the church will hold a gathering on Sunday in the front parking lot at 10:30 a.m. for worship and prayer. Any additional service and programming has been cancelled. The spokesperson also asked that people avoid going inside the church for the time being due to multiple hazards.

Representatives of the church have already met with insurance and a crew is on site to begin clean-up and restoration.

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

(AP) — Who Dey!? Not those same ol’ Bungles. Not even close.

Joe Burrow and these young hungry Cincinnati Bengals are Super Bowl-bound as unexpected and tenacious AFC champions.

Evan McPherson kicked a 31-yard field goal with 9:22 left in overtime after Burrow kept his cool while leading a furious second-half comeback. They got the Bengals to the NFL’s big game for the first time in 33 years with a 27-24 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs for the AFC championship on Sunday.

It’s a special team that’s capable of doing special things” said coach Zac Taylor who was in elementary school the last time the Bengals went to the Super Bowl.

“We’ve said that from the get-go whether people believed us or not” he added. “We believed. So we’re not surprised.”

And who could blame them?

The Bengals erased an 18-point deficit — tying an AFC title game record for largest comeback — to take a late 24-21 lead on McPherson’s 52-yarder.

“I’d say nobody blinked an eye” the rookie kicker said of the Bengals falling behind big early. “I think we all thought we were going to come back and win the game.”

But Harrison Butker’s 44-yard kick as time expired in regulation sent it to overtime a week after his 49-yarder on the final play of regulation did the same against Buffalo.

And after the Bills’ Josh Allen called tails and it came up heads for the overtime coin toss in that one — giving Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs the ball to seal a wild 42-26 victory — Cincinnati backup quarterback Brandon Allen called heads and the coin came up tails.

The Chiefs opened overtime again with the ball but Vonn Bell intercepted Mahomes on the third play and Burrow and the Bengals took over.

And now they’re heading to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1989 after winning their first playoff overtime game.

“Usually when you lose the coin flip to those guys you’re going home” said Burrow the Bengals’ second-year quarterback. “Our defense really stepped up and made plays in the second half. And on offense we made plays when we had to. I thought the offensive line played really well all day. We started running the ball there at the end and that’s exciting.

“Big win for us.”

You might say that.

The Bengals (13-7) will play the winner of the NFC championship between San Francisco and the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl in Los Angeles on Feb. 13. Cincinnati lost to the 49ers in both of its previous trips to the Super Bowl.

Mahomes and the Chiefs (14-6) will be left to lament blowing a chance at a third straight Super Bowl appearance.

“When you’re up 21-3 at any point in the game you can’t lose it” Mahomes said. “I put that on myself.”

The Chiefs had a chance at a winning touchdown in the closing seconds of regulation but sacks by Sam Hubbard on consecutive plays forced Kansas City to settle for the tying field goal.

“We’re going to the Super Bowl” Hubbard said. “It sounds crazy to say that.”

The Bengals have won six of their last seven games against the Chiefs including two this season. But it didn’t look good for Cincinnati early in this one.

The Chiefs got a touchdown on their first three possessions with Mahomes finding Mecole Hardman for a 3-yard score that made it 21-3 — and had this one looking very much like a rout. Mahomes joined Tom Brady (2014) Joe Flacco (2012) and Aaron Rodgers (2010) as the only players with three games with three or more TD passes in a single postseason.

But Burrow kept the Bengals in it.

He tossed a short pass to Samaje Perine who avoided a tackle attempt by Charvarius Ward and raced into the end zone for a 41-yard touchdown with 1:05 left in the opening half.

The Chiefs appeared headed for their fourth straight touchdown drive to open the game especially after Byron Pringle’s 10-yard catch put Kansas City at the 15 with 13 seconds left — setting off chants from the fired-up Arrowhead Stadium crowd of “13 seconds!” who were still reveling in the Chiefs’ stunning comeback last week against Buffalo.

A pass interference call on Eli Apple in the end zone put the ball on the 1 but the Chiefs couldn’t get into the end zone on two tries with Mahomes’ pass to Tyreek Hill losing a yard and ending the half. It ended up costing them.

“I was hoping we could get the ball in the end zone” coach Andy Reid said. “I probably gave the wrong play first of all. I could have given them something better than that. I’ll take responsibility for that one.”

McPherson’s 31-yarder cut the Bengals’ deficit to 21-13 with 2:58 left in the third quarter.

Cincinnati got the ball back at the Chiefs 27 moments later when B.J. Hill intercepted Mahomes’ short pass intended for Demarcus Robinson. Two plays after Joe Mixon gained 2 yards on first-and-goal from the 5 Ja’Marr Chase went up over Rashad Fenton in the end zone to catch Burrow’s toss for a touchdown. Burrow then found a wide-open Trent Taylor for the 2-point conversion to tie it at 21 with 14 seconds left in the third quarter.

The 18-point comeback by Cincinnati tied Indianapolis (vs. New England in 2006) for the largest in AFC championship history.

“I wouldn’t call it surreal I would say it’s exciting” Burrow said. “I think if you would have told me before the season that we’d be going to the Super Bowl I probably would have called you crazy. Then you know we play the whole season and nothing surprises me now.”

STATS

Burrow finished 23 of 38 for 250 yards with the two TDs and an interception. ... Mixon rushed for 88 yards on 21 carries including 28 yards on the final 42-yard drive. ... Mahomes went 26 of 39 for 275 yards and TDs to Hardman Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill and was intercepted twice.

INJURIES

Bengals: TE C.J. Uzomah twisted his left knee in the first quarter and didn’t return. He was on the sideline in the second half using crutches.

Chiefs: Backup TE Noah Gray left with an ankle injury and was ruled out in the second half.

UP NEXT

Bengals: Head to Los Angeles to play in their third Super Bowl and first since 1989.

Chiefs: Head home for the offseason.

Hubungan jin dan manusia bisa terjadi karena dorongan nafsu syahwat (cinta) sampai pada puncaknya jin akan merasuk ke tubuh manusia itu. Foto ilustrasi/ist

وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا يَا مَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ قَدِ اسْتَكْثَرْتُمْ مِنَ الْإِنْسِ ۖ وَقَالَ أَوْلِيَاؤُهُمْ مِنَ الْإِنْسِ رَبَّنَا اسْتَمْتَعَ بَعْضُنَا بِبَعْضٍ وَبَلَغْنَا أَجَلَنَا الَّذِي أَجَّلْتَ لَنَا ۚ قَالَ النَّارُ مَثْوَاكُمْ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ اللَّهُ

إِنَّ هَذِهِ الْحُشُوشَ مُحْتَضَرَة ٌ، فَإِذَا أَتَى أَحَدُكُمْ الْخَلَاءَ فَلْيَقُلْ : أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ مِنْ الْخُبُثِ وَالْخَبَائِثِ (رواه أبو داود، رقم 6 وصححه الألباني في الصحيحة ، رقم

وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَشْتَرِي لَهْوَ الْحَدِيثِ لِيُضِلَّ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّخِذَهَا هُزُوًا أُولَئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُهِينٌ

Bangsa merupakan dua makhluk yang berbeda alam. Jin dan sebangsanya sering dikatakan sebagai makhluk halus atau makhluk tak kasat mata () sedangkan manusia adalah sering disebut makhluk kasar (berwujud) yang dapat dilihat.Akan tetapi antara keduanya terkadang terjalinyang begitu dekat. Bisa saling membantu atau menguntungkan (mutualisma) sebaliknya ada juga hubungan terlarang antara mereka. Dan hubungan inilah yang harus kita hindari. Karena bila tidak maka akan berakibat sangat fatal.Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala sudah mengingatkan:“Dan (ingatlah) hari di waktu Allah menghimpunkan mereka semuanya (manusia dan jin) (dan Allah berfirman) ‘Hai golongan jin (setan) sesungguhnya kamu telah banyak (menyesatkan) manusia.’ Lalu berkatalah kawan-kawan mereka dari golongan manusia ‘Ya Rabb kami sesungguhnya sebagian dari kami (manusia) telah mendapat kesenangan dari sebagian yang lain (jin) dan kami telah sampai kepada waktu yang telah Engkau tentukan bagi kami.’ Allah berfirman ‘Neraka itulah tempat tinggal kamu semua sedang kamu semua kekal di dalamnya kecuali kalau Allah menghendaki (yang lain)’” (QS. al An’am/6: 128).Seperti dilansir Islampos di dalam tafsirnya Ibnu Katsir rahimahullah juga mengutip perkataan al Hasan “Arti sebagian jin dan manusia saling mendapat kesenangan satu sama lain tidak lain ialah jin telah memerintahkan dan mempekerjakan manusia” (Lihat Tafsir Ibnu Katsir tentang Surah al An’am/6 ayat 128).Sementara itu Syaikh Abdur-Rahman bin Hasan Aalu asy Syaikh menukil penjelasan Imam Mula Ali al Qari “Kesenangan yang didapatkan manusia dari jin ialah ketika jin memenuhi kebutuhan manusia menuruti perintah manusia dan memberikan informasi tentang hal-hal ghaib. Sedangkan kesenangan yang diperoleh jin dari manusia ialah ketika manusia mengagung-agungkan jin meminta perlindungan dan tunduk kepada jin” (Lihat Fat-hul Majid Syarh Kitab at Tauhid Syaikh Abdur Rahman bin Hasan Aal asy Syaikh Bab Minasy-Syirki al Isti’adzatu bi Ghairillah. Pembahasan ayat pertama halaman 134).Bisa dikatakan bahwa hubungan atau interaksi antara manusia dan jin bisa dalam bentuk pengagungan manusia kepada jin dan jin merasa bangga dengan tindakan mereka. Bisa juga terjadi karena dorongan nafsu syahwat sampai pada puncaknya jin akan merasuk ke tubuh manusia itu.Karena itulah menjadi kewaspadaan bagi manusia terutama kaum wanita. Kenapa? karena jin sangat menyukai perempuan terutama yang suka mengumbar aurat mereka.Syaikhul Islam Ibnu Taimiyah dalam Kitabnya Majmu al-Fatawa mengatakan ""Jin merasuk ke dalam tubuh manusia terkadang karena syahwat hawa nafsu atau jatuh cinta. Sebagaimana yang terjadi antara manusia dengan sesama manusia.""Intinya manusia sangat mungkin dicintai oleh jin makhluk yang tidak kelihatan. Karena mereka melihat manusia sementara normalnya manusia tidak bisa melihat jin.Dirangkum dari berbagai sumber berikuat tanda-tanda jin menyenangi wanita dari golongan manusia dan mencoba merasukinya di antaranya adalah:1. Sering memimpikan seorang lelakiLelaki yang mendatanginya dalam mimpi bisa saja seorang yang telah ia kenal maupun yang tidak ia kenali.2. Mudah sekali meninggalkan shalatPerempuan yang telah dinikahi oleh jin biasanya akan lebih mudah meninggalkan salat baik itu salat wajib maupun salat sunnat. Hal ini disebabkan lemahnya keimanan seorang wanita sehingga gampang dinikahi oleh jin dan jin akan membuatnya semakin jauh dari Allah Ta'ala.3. Sering berlama-lama di kamar mandiNabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda“Sesungguhnya tempat buang hajat didatangi setan. Jika kalian masuk WC maka ucapkanlah; A’uuzu billahi minal khubutsi wal khabaits (aku berlindung kepada Allah dari setan laki dan perempuan)” (HR Abu Dawud)4. Sangat menyukai musikAllah ‘Azza wa jalla bersabda“Dan di antara manusia ada orang yang mempergunakan perkataan yang tidak berguna untuk menyesatkan manusia dari jalan Allah tanpa pengetahuan dan menjadikan jalan Allah itu olok-olokan. Mereka itu akan memperoleh azab yang menghinakan.” (QS. Lukman: 6)Abdullah bin Mas’ud radhiyallahu ‘anhu salah satu sahabat Rasulullah berkata ketika ditanya tentang maksud ayat ini maka beliau menjawab bahwa itu adalah musik seraya beliau bersumpah dan mengulangi perkataannya sebanyak tiga kali."

The move follows an amendment made in the unified licence (UL) in December by the Department of Telecom (DoT) which extended storage of call data records as well as internet logs to two years from earlier provision of one year.UL holders are telecom companies like Bharti Airtel Reliance Jio Vodafone Idea BSNL for providing all kinds of telecom services except satellite phone services.""The licensee shall maintain all commercial records call data record exchange detail record IP detail record with regard to the communications exchanged on the network. Such records shall be archived for at least two years for scrutiny by the licensor for security reasons and may be destroyed thereafter unless directed otherwise directed by the licensor"" the circular dated January 27 for voice mail audiotex and unified messaging service license said.The amendment applies to companies like Tata Communications Cisco's Webex AT&T Global Network etc who have subscribed to these licences.The DoT made amendments in ILD licence on January 25 which besides extending an additional one year for maintaining call detail records includes provision for storing details of international communications made using internet protocol.A similar amendment has been issued for licence issued to BSNL for providing satellite phone calls and data services as well as for VSAT licence holders who provide satellite based services on January 24 mandating them to maintain call data and internet communications records for at least two years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2NpdGllcy9oeWRlcmFiYWQvMjAyMi9KYW4vMzAvc292ZXJlaWdudHktYS1ncmV5LWFyZWEtaW4tY3liZXItc3BhY2UtZXhwZXJ0cy0yNDEyOTk0Lmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3aW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2NpdGllcy9oeWRlcmFiYWQvMjAyMi9KYW4vMzAvc292ZXJlaWdudHktYS1ncmV5LWFyZWEtaW4tY3liZXItc3BhY2UtZXhwZXJ0cy0yNDEyOTk0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sovereignty a grey area in cyber space: Experts,Latha Reddy former deputy National Security Adviser spoke about digital colonialism and the dichotomy between the US and China in their use of cyber space.

Global banking giant Citigroup agreed to sell its consumer banking businesses in four Southeast Asian markets to Singapore-headquartered Union Overseas Bank (UOB) in a deal valued at approximately $5 billion Singapore dollars ($3.7 billion).

The agreement which is due to complete by early 2024 pending regulatory approval will see Citi divest its consumer banking business in Indonesia Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam. The bank also sold its retail banking business in Taiwan to Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings for approximately $2 billion.

UOB Southeast Asia’s third-largest bank will acquire Citi’s secured and unsecured lending portfolios wealth management and retail deposit businesses. In addition approximately 5000 Citi employees in the four countries are expected to transfer to UOB. Under the terms of the deal the bank agreed to pay Citi a premium equivalent to S$915 million ($678 million) plus the net asset value of the consumer business.

UOB will finance the acquisition internally from excess capital and expects to reduce its common equity Tier 1 ratio to 12.8%. The deal will intensify competition among the large Singapore banks including UOB rivals DBS and OCBC Bank and pit them against regional rivals.

Citi will remain in the four markets as part of a blueprint to concentrate on key business segments. “Focusing our business through these actions will facilitate additional investment in our strategic focus areas including our institutional network across Asia-Pacific” said Citi Asia Pacific CEO Peter Babej commenting on the deal.

The latest deal furthers Citi’s stated objective of selling its consumer business in 13 markets across Asia and EMEA that Citi says will release approximately $7 billion of equity. In December Citi agreed to sell its Philippines consumer banking business to Union Bank of the Philippines. A month later the bank announced its intention to sell the consumer small business and middle-market banking operations of Mexico City–based Citibanamex despite investing heavily in the businesses during its 20-year presence. In 2001 Citi acquired Banamex for $12.5 billion in what was the largest deal ever in Mexico at the time.",,,,,,,,,

Consultant Manager of Home Isolation Dr. Adana Grandison on Saturday gave the assurance that COVID-19 positive patients could safely home isolate with negative family members without spreading the virus if the necessary precautions are put in place.

Speaking during a virtual press conference to provide a COVID-19 update Dr. Grandison noted that there was a “significant amount of panic” about how negative persons should handle themselves in a household where a family member tested positive for the virus.

“We have had a few unfortunate situations where persons would have become COVID positive and would have been asked to leave the home by their family members; placed on the outside” she said.

However the doctor stressed that COVID was not a death sentence and outlined a series of measures to be taken in the event that a family member has tested positive and asked to home isolate.

Some of these measure include: the use of a properly fitted face mask; the frequent sanitisation of a shared bathroom and regularly touched surfaces such as handles sink knobs and the toilet bowl handle to flush with antibacterial wipes like Lysol or Clorox wipes or Clorox mixed with water.

She added that in cases where a COVID-19 positive person needed to share a bed with a family member who was negative then they should do so in a head-to-toe situation and facing away from each other.

Positive breastfeeding mothers were also encouraged to continue breastfeeding their infants but to ensure that they wear a mask while doing so.

Dr. Grandison further encouraged persons isolating at home to “allow themselves to be pampered” and have their meals prepared and brought to them while staying in their room where possible.

These meals the doctor pointed out should be brought preferably in disposable containers but should regular household wares be used they should be washed with warm water and soap and allowed to dry.

Dr. Grandison also acknowledged the importance of mental health and noted that in the event that the COVID-19 positive person needed to leave the room for any reason then they should wear a mask in the presence of other family members.

She also urged persons who notice relatives developing symptoms such as shortness of breath extreme weakness or tiredness and loss of consciousness or fainting to seek assistance urgently.

Dr. Grandison said that with the prevailing Omicron variant doctors were seeing an increase in cases of persons with vomiting and diarrhoea. In such cases she advised persons to “take it nice and slow” and to use small volumes of fluid to remain hydrated.

Noting that the Omicron wave appears to be mild for the majority of persons given the predominance of non-communicable diseases Dr. Grandison advised persons to pay close attention to monitoring their blood pressure and blood sugar and eating healthy foods. There are currently 9575 persons in the home isolation programme with 3426 of them being categorised as ‘green’ meaning they are not showing any symptoms. To date there have been 17287 persons discharged and eight deaths recorded under the programme.",,,,,,,,,,,,

India has been progressing steadily in decarbonizing the energy mix. The county has doubled the renewable energy (RE) capacity in five years from 50GW at the end of 2016 to 105GW at the end of 2021. Except for the year 2020 when COVID-19 affected the growth rest of the years have witnessed capacity addition over 10GW annually.In terms of electricity generation  RE has also contributed considerably to green the consumption mix. This is exemplified by the graph below which reflects that RE contribution has increased from monthly average of 12 Billion Units (BUs) in 2020 to 14 BU in 2021. Further the recent announcement of cumulative deployment of 500GW clean capacity target by 2030 would see increased penetration of clean energy in the overall energy mix.The year 2021 was a landmark one for the RE sector. Cumulative 100GW capacity installation milestone was achieved in this year which further adds up to 150GW if one includes hydro power projects into it. The country has committed to achieving net zero by the year 2070 which supports the adoption of RE and other clean energy technologies not only for electricity but for other energy applications as well.The Government of India and the state governments have been promoting the implementation of both grid connected and off-grid projects in every nook and corner of the country. There are supportive policies rebates and relaxations on charges and losses for electricity distribution capital subsidy incentives etc which are helping the growth. Further the government is also focusing on greening the electricity requirement of agriculture sector by solarization of feeders and pumps through PM-KUSUM scheme. Besides the government is promoting deployment of RE systems with livelihood applications as well to make the consumers self-reliant and sustainable in energy mix.Solar cell and solar module manufacturing: The PLI scheme with a financial outlay of INR 4500 crore for manufacturing of ‘High Efficiency Solar PV Modules’ witnessed an overwhelming response and received proposals to setup 54.8GW of manufacturing capacity. Based on the success the Government of India is planning to increase the PLI scheme outlay to INR 24000 crores.In May 2021 govt approved PLI scheme for manufacturing of 50GWh ACC batteries with an estimated outlay of INR 18100 crore for 5 years starting from the date of manufacturing. The scheme has received encouraging response from battery manufacturers from across the globe expressing their interest to enter into the Indian market.Some states have recently asked project developers to renegotiate the tariff agreed in the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for renewable energy (RE) projects with an expectation to reduce the tariff to current market rates. This would adversely affect the viability of the projects given these were installed at the prevalent market costs which have reduced considerably over the years and thus would not ensure recovery of investments made into the projects.The Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) on RE products from 5% to 12% which would increase the cost of project development. Further Basic Customs Duty (BCD) of 25% on solar PV cells and 40% on solar modules would be applicable starting April 2022 which will increase the cost of project dependent upon imported cells and modules.The sector despite being established witnesses high rate of interest to finance the project leading to increased cost and thus the tariffs.The components involved in setting up a project attracts GST however the electricity supplied through it does not come under the ambit of GST and thus the tax outlay is not reimbursed.The country is promoting self-reliance in in RE components such as solar cells modules storage etc. however the cost of electricity is high which affects the cost of production and hampering the growth of domestic manufacturing.To optimally utilize the manufacturing capacities the manufacturers export turbines etc. to other countries; however the incentives have been reduced considerably in recent years which leads to increased cost and thus reduces competitiveness for Indian equipment in global market.The sector has to swiftly move from current 105GW to 500GW clean energy capacity by 2029-30.A roadmap & yearly plan should be developed immediately and budgetary push will help. The following enablers in the union budget can push the RE sector to expand the reach:The Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 paves way for a number of enabling frameworks including de-licensing of power distribution. It would be pertinent if the bill can be passed to allow for improved competition and efficiency in the sector.The recent PLI scheme for solar manufacturing is considered a success given overwhelming response received from the industry. A similar PLI scheme can be rolled out for smaller manufacturing capacities as well to promote other potential manufacturers with lower investment appetite. Further PLI scheme can also be announced for other components contributing to domestic RE manufacturing which can help reduce the cost across the value chain.The recent revision of GST on RE components from 5% to 12% has adversely affected the cost of setting up RE projects and thus needs to be revisited and revised to lowest possible slab to ensure cost effectiveness of the systems.The budget can also focus on revising the duty structure for manufacturing of RE components and avoid any inverted duty structure wherein raw materials attract higher GST while the finished good attracts lower GST thus increasing the tax liability on the project.Imposition of GST on electricity will help the manufacturers and suppliers neutralize the tax implication and would further add to the government’s revenue inflow.While India is expanding the RE manufacturing base it is important to promote the import of equipment/component till the manufacturing is self-reliant. Further sectors like wind which are under utilized domestically can be promoted with export incentives to utilize their manufacturing base and improve global competitiveness.RE projects including manufacturing can be facilitated with relaxed norms and interest rates to promote RE adoption.The Government of India may announce Hydrogen Purchase Obligation in this budget 2022-23. This can be supplemented with incentives and support mechanisms to enable industries such as fertilizer refineries and other entities to be obligated to adopt interventions to setup green hydrogen plants or procure green hydrogen for their respective industrial applications.The government may roll out a roadmap with incentives and support mechanism such as concessional loans dedicated zones etc. to promote implementation of projects based on green hydrogen energy storage etc. Further the states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu itself have about 71GW of offshore wind potential combined. However the technology is yet to see any commercial implementation and thus can be supported with financial support in form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF) to ensure financial viability of initial projects and support development of the sector.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Budget 2022: 'Continue initiatives policies to further strengthen domestic solar manufacturing',"By Gyanesh Chaudhary

Recommendations for the Union Budget to boost solar adoption and manufacturing:

(The author is vice-chairman & managing director of Vikram Solar Ltd. Views expressed are personal.)

NEW DELHI: The government of India under the leadership of the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has accelerated the transition to clean energy with solar adoption.This is evident from the earlier achievement (in calendar 2021) of the COP21 target of 40% renewables by 2030 nine years ahead of schedule.Solar (48.55 GW) has been at the forefront leading this transformation of India’s renewable landscape.The government’s steps toward encouraging solar adoption and transitioning to renewable energy sources has indeed fast-tracked the solar sector.This has been possible due to the government’s consistence and conducive policy impetus for the renewable energy sector.The target of 500 GW renewable energy by 2030 PLI budget expected to be increased to Rs 24000 crore for solar cells & modules and India’s net zero emission target by 2070 will bring incredible new opportunities.In the Union Budget 2022-23 we are hopeful the government will continue the targeted initiatives and policies to further strengthen the domestic solar manufacturing eco-system aligned to the Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision and the government’s target of 500 GW renewables by 2030.This will accelerate economic recovery create jobs attract investments increase exports reduce dependence on imports and enable India’s Energy Security. The upcoming Budget must also continue to focus on boosting private investments and enhance expenditure on infrastructure.Initiatives like the National Policy on Electronics increasing export incentives launching phased manufacturing programmes (PMP) the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme and planning a new industrial policy under the current regime had increased FDI flows to the country and created an environment to transform the manufacturing sector.Besides schemes for solar parks and ultra-mega solar projects schemes for setting up 5-GW grid connected solar power projects a Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) scheme for setting up 12 GW grid connected solar project with Viability Gap Funding (VGF) support the grid connected solar rooftop programme 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) have been steps in the right direction towards the clean energy transition.Further the recent approval of the second phase of the green energy corridor project Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan Yojana (PM-KUSUM) subsidies for ground mounted and rooftop solar installation net-metering to improve solar installation and green energy generation within the country are welcome steps enabling India’s transition to a low-carbon economy.* The 80% accelerated depreciation benefit to be re-instated for solar industry* Imposition of Basic Customs Duty (BCD) effective April 1 2022* Allowing clearance from Special Economic Zones (SEZ) to Domestic Tariff Areas (DTA) on a duty forgone basis* Allowing conversion of SEZ units in SEZs into DTA and continue operating from the same infrastructure with enabling rules for conversion. Further the duty payments on conversion to DTA to be linked with the status of Net Foreign Exchange (NFE) of the unit* To enhance the global competitiveness of domestic manufacturers export incentive and remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP) rates should be enhanced. The rates should be commensurate with the actual embedded/un-refunded taxes and duties. RoDTEP benefits should also be provided to SEZs* National Clean Energy fund (NCEF) should be made available to solar manufacturing firms to expand their Research and Development to produce cost-efficient energy solutions* States/Municipal corporations across the country should be provided with dedicated budgets for solar rooftop installations under the NCEF* Capital subsidy of 50% to set up R&D and quality testing infrastructure within the manufacturing unit would encourage entrepreneurs to build scale with quality* Super deduction of 200% for R&D expenses for clean energy and particularly solar technology development* Setting up of a dedicated agency to provide insurance cover for solar power installations at affordable prices would give a good boost to the sector* 5% Interest Subvention on term loans and working capital upfront Central Financial Assistance of 30% on CAPEX* Special fund should be allocated to develop an Electric Vehicle (EV) battery ecosystem* Introduction of a refund mechanism of GST for GST distributed to SEZ units from common GST inputs which was there in the Service Tax regime* Exemption of GST on the freight paid on imports as GST has already been charged on Cost Freight and Insurance (CFI) value of imports* In RoDTEP include AA (Advance Authorisation) along with SEZ* A cess on diesel should be imposed and used to expand EV infrastructure in the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9yZW5ld2FibGVzL2luY2VudGl2ZXMtZm9yLWdyZWVuLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWxpa2VseS1pbi11bmlvbi1idWRnZXQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODkyMTc1MjcuY21z0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9yZW5ld2FibGVzL2luY2VudGl2ZXMtZm9yLWdyZWVuLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWxpa2VseS1pbi11bmlvbi1idWRnZXQvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg5MjE3NTI3LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Incentives for green hydrogen likely in Union Budget,"

The government may provide for targeted fiscal incentives and allocation of funds for promotion of green hydrogen in the country in Union Budget 2022-23 which is slated to be unveiled in Parliament on Tuesday. The government launched National Hydrogen Mission in 2021. Earlier this month Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh had indicated that a green hydrogen policy will be unveiled in February which would feature many incentives to boost green hydrogen in the country.""While 2021 saw the launch of National Hydrogen Mission it is likely that the Budget may provide for targeted fiscal incentives for R&D in green hydrogen segment creation of domestic supply chain for hydrogen and reduce customs duties on electrolysers to boost green hydrogen production"" says Venkatesh Raman Prasad Partner J Sagar Associates (JSA).Prasad is of the view that India 's commitment at COP 26 of achieving net zero emissions by 2070 and meet 50 per cent of energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030 shows that the government intends to focus on cleaner sources of energy.Hemant Mallya Senior Programme Lead Council on Energy Environment and Water (CEEW) opines that green hydrogen has many industrial uses and can potentially decarbonise many hard-to-abate sectors like the iron and steel industry.He says that an outlay of Rs 1200 crore by 2024 in the upcoming Budget could trigger pilots in various end-use applications such as testing green hydrogen readiness of natural gas pipelines underground hydrogen storage and pilots for equipment such as furnaces boilers and process heaters.He suggests that another Rs 165 crore could support R&D especially on catalysts and electrolyser membranes finding substitutes for critical minerals setting up testing labs and enforcing safety standards.These investments would help indigenize green hydrogen production and use as an industrial fuel he opines.Davinder Sandhu Co-founder & Chairman Primus Partners says that electrolysers used to manufacture hydrogen at present are expensive and bringing down their cost will contribute to reducing the cost of green hydrogen.This will enable the country to meet the target of establishing 10 gigawatt of domestic manufacturing capacity as well as making India a global leader in the sector he opines.In this regard he suggests that the government should consider a production linked incentive (PLI) scheme which can support indigenization of electrolysers and scaling up of green hydrogen production at optimized cost.Earlier this month Union minister R K Singh had said a new green hydrogen policy will feature incentives like free power transmission for 25 years dollar denominated bids offer of land in renewable energy parks and land allocation near ports for creating bunkers for green hydrogen or ammonia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvaHlkZXJhYmFkL3RlbGFuZ2FuYS1zdGFydHVwcy1jaGFyZ2UtdXAtZm9yLWV2LWJhdHRlcnktcGxheS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84OTIxNTc1Ni5jbXPSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9oeWRlcmFiYWQvdGVsYW5nYW5hLXN0YXJ0dXBzLWNoYXJnZS11cC1mb3ItZXYtYmF0dGVyeS1wbGF5L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84OTIxNTc1Ni5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telangana startups charge up for EV battery play,HYDERABAD: With the rise in demand ( EVs ) and increasing need to reduce dependence on imports of lithium-ion cells a bunch of startups in Telangana are upping their game to tap this multi-billion-dollar opportunity in the coming days.Batteries are the key component in EVs and account for up to 50% of the total EV cost. Currently India does not manufacture lithium-ion batteries and all its EVs are dependent on cells and battery packs imported largely from China.Anjani Sri Mourya Sunkavalli co-founder Allox said his startup is working towards being a leading material producer for lithium ion battery cells in the country.In August 2021 Allox entered into a pact with the International Advanced Research Centre for Powand New Matescale up with the help of the latter’s technology of developing Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) in a cost-effective manner.For a battery one needs cells and for cells anode cathode electrolytes and separators are required. While anode material (graphite) is abundantly available in India cathode material is scarce because it requires lithium which is not available in India. Allox will be manufacturing the cathode material -LFP in India.“Currently we have a capacity SUNDAY SPECIAL to produce 50 Kg LFP per day and we are planning to scale it up to 1015 tonnes per day by the end of this year. This makes us the only company in India that is manufacturing LFP using indigenous technology and superior quality material that performs better than Chinese LFP” he said adding that their LFP is highly economical also. Earlier this year Mahesh Godi startup GODI claimed that his company had become the first player in India to design develop and manu21700 lithium-ion cells in-house.GODI is now in parleys with major OEMs for this product. Indian OEMs are hard-pressed for lithiumion cells that are imported at a pre- mium from countries like China and South Korea among others and also have a long waiting period for deliveries.“By 2025 our goal is to set up a 250-acre campus with around 500 PhDs that will focus on R&D in energy technology” Godi said. BILITI Electric (formerly Gayam has restructured and formed an umbrella company BILITI Electric in the US and Gayam has now become a backend supplier of EVs to BILITI.“We are a company that came with the idea of battery swapping in India much before the EV boom picked up. Our early vision for battery swapping helped us in indigenously developing EV batteries inhouse” Bavirisetty said.“We can have control over battery size weight shape interface communication and several other aspects . . . While we currently do cell designing and R&D inhouse we have scalable cell manufacturing plans as well in our roadmap” he added.Last year IIT Hyderabad-incu- bated startup PURE EV developed an AI-driven hardware that automated identification and repairing of defects in lithium-ion batteries of EVs. Similarly RACEnergy incentivizes adoption of EV mobility by taking the cost of the battery out of the vehicle and offering energy as a service (Eaas) through a network of EV battery swapping stations.The drivers can swap their discharged batteries with charged ones within two minutes. The startup intends to set up 500 battery swap stations in India by mid-2023 of which 100 will be in Hyderabad.In fact to encourage more players to innovate in the battery-tech space Telangana IT and indusRanjan pointed out that the state is exploring possibilities to secure lithium supply for all the companies that are going to be located in Hyderabad.Apart from this the state government it is also setting up a 400-acre energy park at Divitipally in Mahbubnagar.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L3Bvd2VyL2Zhci1mcm9tLWR5aW5nLXRoZS1jb2FsLWluZHVzdHJ5LWlzLWFjdHVhbGx5LWJvb21pbmctanVzdC1sb29rLWF0LXRoZXNlLXNpZ25zL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg5MTkzODExLmNtc9IBnAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L3Bvd2VyL2Zhci1mcm9tLWR5aW5nLXRoZS1jb2FsLWluZHVzdHJ5LWlzLWFjdHVhbGx5LWJvb21pbmctanVzdC1sb29rLWF0LXRoZXNlLXNpZ25zL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84OTE5MzgxMS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Far from dying the coal industry is actually booming.

In late 2021 diplomats spent hours arguing over whether to ""phase-out"" or ""phase-down"" coal in the final communique of the COP26 climate change summit. Under pressure from China and India the watered-down second choice prevailed. Still it was good enough for the United Nations to proclaim that the dirtiest fuel was being ""consigned to history.""Nothing is further from reality.Coal is neither down or out. The best words to define the coal market today were pronounced in 2001 by Ivan Glasenberg the former boss of commodity behemoth Glencore Plc. Back then the foul-mouthed commodity tycoon said that “everyone’s h--ny as hell for coal.” Two decades later in a more politically-correct world one can simply say the coal industry is booming.Look at the market. The benchmark thermal coal price in Asia last week jumped to almost $244 per metric ton the second-highest ever and only a handful of dollars below a peak in October. In a sign of market frenzy — triggered in part by an export ban by major producer Indonesia — one small shipment last week traded above $300 a ton in what many in the market believe is the most expensive coal transaction ever. The coal that’s used in steelmaking — so-called metallurgical or coking — is also trading at a record high changing hands above $400 per ton.The mining companies that have stuck with coal despite pressure to divest are making a killing. Look at Glencore the world’s largest exporter of seaborne thermal coal. Its shares have risen to a 10-year high as investors anticipate a cash bonanza. For them it’s an ideal world: Demand is rising while supply is constrained because institutional investors led by BlackRock Inc. have convinced nearly every miner to stop opening new pits. The arrangement is so good that from the outside it almost looks like a cartel.What’s good for Glencore and other die-hard coal enthusiasts is terrible news for the planet. The commodity is the world’s most carbon-intensive fuel and every energy scenario compatible with net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 features a rapid decline in its use. The opposite is happening though sending more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Last year the world burnt the largest amount ever of coal to produce electricity. And under current trends total global consumption which on top of power generation also includes industrial uses such as in steel and cement will hit a record high this year according to the International Energy Agency.The consumption boom has wrong-footed many who said back in 2013-14 that coal demand had peaked and would soon start to decline. At best coal consumption is settling at a high altitude plateau. At worst it may continue rising. Beyond this year the IEA forecasts some additional small demand increases for 2023 and 2024 setting fresh record highs in both years.The gap between the world’s ambition to get rid of coal and the reality of its energy system hasn’t been wider. China is a key reason why demand climbed so much last year and continues to do so in 2022. Facing electricity shortages Beijing ordered its state-owned coal miners in late 2021 into Stakhanovite efforts to avoid blackouts. The result was that the Asian giant dug more coal than ever in November and December.But Beijing wasn’t alone. In the U.S. Senator Joe Manchin is doing his best to keep the coal industry alive. Governments in green-conscious Europe turn a blind eye to burning coal for electricity when the wind isn’t blowing the sun isn’t shining and natural gas becomes too expensive. The U.K. on Monday burnt the most coal in nearly a year to help keep the lights on. And then there are the own-goals. In one perplexing policy decision Germany is retiring its nuclear power stations quicker than its coal-fired plants. Nuclear power should easily substitute for coal in delivering electricity.All of that means that coal demand is likely to grow nearly 3% from 2019 to 2024 reaching an all-time high of 8031 million tons according to the IEA. The forecast is far more pessimistic than the three scenarios the agency mapped last year for future energy demand. One saw demand roughly flat from 2019 to 2024; the two others pointed to consumption falling. Using the IEA numbers the world would need to reduce coal demand by more than 20% from 2019 to 2024 to be on a trajectory compatible with the agency’s goal of net-zero by 2050. For now the world is heading in the opposite direction.Optimists will say coal is losing market share in global electricity production as green energy sources like wind and solar take hold. On paper they are right: In 2022 coal is likely to account for about 36% of the world’s electricity production down from more than 40% only a few years ago. But that’s of little help to the atmosphere which cares about the absolute number of coal burnt — and therefore CO2 emitted — rather than percentage of market share. The optimists are technically right — but wrong in practice.The world needs to stop debating about whether to phase-out phase-down and other grand statements that do little to reduce consumption. Instead it needs to focus on why coal is in so much demand and how to change it — not in 2050 but over the next ten years."

In October 2020 the moment Trish Priest had been dreading arrived: Tab the decades-old diet drink was being killed off by parent company Coca-Cola.

What to some was a mere news blip was a crisis for Priest.

“I lived in fear of it being discontinued for years” she said. “When the notification came out that Coca-Cola was going to stop making it I had people I hadn’t spoken to in 10 years call me to give me their condolences.”

Priest drinks about three cans of Tabs a day and has for as long as she can remember. “It is a central part of my life” she said and something she’s known for. “I’ve had [colleagues] decorate my office for a milestone birthday” with Tab-themed decorations and “I drink Tab water and wine.”

Priest started stockpiling cases of Tab in 2020 when she realized the drink would soon be gone. She has 23 12-packs left and she’s rationing her supply. She’ll hang onto the final case “for posterity.”

But Priest isn’t giving up without a fight. She’s hoping that with the help of fellow diehard fans they’ll convince Coca-Cola to bring Tab back.

It will be a tough battle as Coca-Cola which has its reasons for killing Tab. The product was cut as part of a sweeping reduction of Coca-Cola’s beverage portfolio announced in 2020. The reasoning was clear: The 200 brands on the chopping block — half of Coke’s portfolio — together made up just 2% of Coca-Cola’s total revenue CEO James Quincey said. It just wasn’t worth it for to keep pouring resources into these flagging products.

“It was a hard decision to discontinue TaB” a company spokesperson told CNN Business. “In order to continue to innovate and give consumers the choices they want we have to make tough choices about our portfolio.”

The spokesperson said that “there are no plans to bring [Tab] back.”

Tab fans think Coke made the wrong call. From where they sit Tab sales were stilted because Coca-Cola neglected the brand letting it linger without advertising for decades. They point out that even without ads Tab fans have still sought out the product — imagine they say what some marketing could do. Plus nostalgia is hot right now.

It may be hard to imagine a massive company like Coke giving in to a comparatively small fanbase of a forgotten brand. But it’s happened before.

Adam Burbach noticed a flurry of activity online after Coke announced Tab’s demise. Across social channels fans were mourning the product and wondering whether they could change Coca-Cola’s decision.

“A lot of people [were] saying we should do something” he said. “The initial … thought behind the committee was coordinating efforts so that we had a single voice.”

Burbach took action. He launched a full-blown campaign to bring back the soda along with a core group of fans including Priest that calls themselves the SaveTabSoda Committee. The group has coordinated call days encouraging fans to bombard Coca-Cola’s customer service line with (polite) phone calls and to send notes to Coca-Cola’s leadership team.

“We appreciate the passionate legion of Tab lovers who have reached out and who embraced the brand for nearly six decades” the company spokesperson said.

Coke’s top brass has taken notice: In an interview with CNN Business late last year CEO James Quincey said he’s gotten “a lot of emails about Tab.”

A petition to bring back Tab has garnered nearly 1100 signatures and the committee is currently raising money for billboards in Coke’s home city Atlanta that will blast its message to passing motorists and any Coke executives who drive by.

The efforts so far have been fruitless — Coca-Cola (KO) has given no indication it will bring Tab back. But the company does have a history of listening to its fans. Most notably it quickly reversed course on New Coke in 1985 after fans railed against the new recipe.

There’s a big difference between paying attention to feedback on Coke Coca-Cola’s signature product and something like Tab. But Coca-Cola has changed course on fringe products too.

Surge makes a comeback

Coca-Cola introduced Surge to the market in 1997 as a competitor to Mountain Dew and pulled it six years later. Bereft Surge fans wanted it back and years later in 2011 a group of social media enthusiasts decided to help.

Meanwhile Matt Winans had created a Surge page on Facebook in the early days of the platform so he could “like” the soda and eventually the page gathered thousands of fans. Winans spotted the “Surge Movement” and reached out to its founder to see if he’d like to be a page administrator.

“We joined forces and the rest is pretty much history” Winans said.

Winans and others worked for years to bring Surge back. Like Tab fans they wrote letters and scheduled call-ins. They spent money on Facebook ads. And in 2014 Coca-Cola brought Surge back in a limited capacity in what the company spokesperson called a “business decision.” Surge was discontinued in bottles and cans as part of the October 2020 purge but is still available in some restaurants.

With Surge’s success in mind Burbach tapped Winans to talk strategy on Tab.

“He wanted to know exactly what we did bring it back” said Winans who thinks Burbach and his team have a good shot.

“Both [Tab and Surge] are retro both have cemented themselves as pop culture icons both have that intrinsic cult following” Winans said. His advice? “SaveTab should keep up the hard work.”

What’s next for Save Tab

If Coca-Cola won’t bring Tab back the fans have backup plans.

“I have a box of [Diet Coke] syrup and a SodaStream which is going to be my fallback solution” said Priest. As Burbach’s supply dwindles he’s switched to some Mountain Dew zero-sugar products (Mountain Dew is owned by PepsiCo (PEP)).

Jenny Boyter a committee member who estimates she sent about 25 letters to Coke and made a video celebrating Tab says she’ll switch to Diet Pepsi Diet Dr Pepper or iced tea.

But she’s holding out for the best-case scenario. “My plan is for Coke to say ‘Let me just pull the truck up and deliver more Tab to you’” Boyter said. “That’s my fantasy.”

As much as Boyter wants Tab back she’s also been enjoying her committee work. “It’s so fun” she said. “I feel … really close to them.”

Boyter is in it for the long haul partially because of the connections she’s made with people like Burbach and Priest.

“I would feel really guilty saying ‘I’ve been working on this for a couple years it’s not happening I’m out’” she said. “I’ll still want to stay with the committee and keep on trying.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdmlja3NidXJnbmV3cy5jb20vdmlja3NidXJnLWJvdHRsZWQtdGhlLXZlcnktZmlyc3QtYm90dGxlLW9mLWNvY2EtY29sYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vicksburg bottled the very first bottle of Coca-Cola,"The very first bottle of Coca-Cola was bottled right here in Vicksburg Mississippi.

Vicksburg is known for many interesting things. The small Southern city has been long associated with the Civil War blues music and has even been in the Guinness World Records for having the longest running show a melodrama known as “Gold in the Hills.” Locals are more familiar with the historical background of Vicksburg but many of those who don’t live here are unaware of some of the more unique details of the city. Those unique details would include the important role Vicksburg played in the history of the most popular soft drink in the world Coca-Cola.

A pharmacist named Dr. John S. Pemberton invented the drink known as Coca-Cola in 1866 in Atlanta Georgia. The Coca-Cola syrup became a popular choice at soda fountains in the south and eventually made its way to Vicksburg. The first Coca-Cola was bottled in the summer of 1894 by Joe Biedenharn in what is now known as the Biedenharn Coca-Cola Museum located at 1107 Washington Street.

In 1939 Biedenharn wrote a letter to Harrison Jones who was the vice president of the Coca Cola company at the time. In the letter he stated “We were operating a wholesale and retail confectionary business and were dispensing Coca-Cola through our soda fountain so this proposal fell right into line with our jobbing business. Consumer demand has increased and was increasing rapidly as Coca-Cola would only be had in the cities where the fountains were dispensing it. The thought struck one day ‘Why not bottle it for our country trade?’ We were in the soda bottling game and it was easy to start it going.”



A trip to the Biedenharn Coca-Cola museum will have guests taking a short tour through hundreds of Coca-Cola artifacts. The history of the Biedenharn family and of Coca-Cola can be learned about there. After perusing the memorabilia one can stop to visit the original soda fountain that once served soft drinks to the people in Vicksburg. The museum now aims to preserve American history by continuing to educate locals and tourists about these fascinating events of the past.

The company aims to minimize waste and deliver higher returns to farmer partners.

Tractor Beverage Company sources organic non-GMO ingredients from farms around the world. Its beverage line offers 20 flavors including Blossom ‘N Spice made with orange blossom fig apricot lemon ginger and Mandarin Cardamom made with citrus fruit cardamom turmeric apricot kernel oil and coriander.

Tractor beverages are sold at restaurants across the U.S. including major companies like Chipotle Taїm José Andrés’ ThinkFoodGroup Umami Burger and Roti and five universities. By partnering with restaurants rather than grocery stores the company is taking steps to reduce packaging and shipping costs.

Travis Potter a farmer founded Tractor Beverage to create a healthy sustainable beverage alternative for his children–one with an ingredient list that did not include chemical preservatives.

As beverage manufacturers “if we can do a good job of supplying [our product] at a good price and we’re smart about how we do it there’s no reason to have the junky stuff especially if it tastes better” Potter tells Food Tank.

Potter’s agricultural background helps to inform his role in the beverage industry. He explains that his experience helped him identify an opportunity to invent a product line that was healthier than name brands.

The company minimizes waste by using parts of ingredients that often go to waste but still offer taste and health benefits. Examples include cassia bark used in their root beer flavor and lemon peel used in their Lemonade flavor.

Using these upcycled ingredients “makes a better-quality product for consumers and adds health and wellness” says Potter.

Potter also strives to deliver higher returns to farmer partners. He works to source high value ingredients including cinnamon cardamom and ginger that simultaneously offer greater profitability to farmers and create a tastier more complex product.

Potter hopes that farmers will feel incentivized to abandon conventional agriculture and adopt organic practices. To do this he believes that consumer education will play an important role.

According to the latest IBISWorld report soft drink consumption in the U.S. has fallen every year since the late 1990s at an average annual rate of 0.8 percent. This trend is due to consumers’ growing health concerns and the prevalence of diet and weight-related illnesses such as diabetes. Many consumers are seeking healthier substitutes while others have completely cut out sugary drinks.

In the U.S. sugary soft drinks are the single largest source of added sugar in the American diet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Excess sugary drink consumption is also associated with a number of chronic illnesses including obesity type 2 diabetes and heart disease making it a public health priority.

And as socially and environmentally engaged consumers work to avoid traditional soda they are often turning to new carbonated drinks.

With the rising demand for sugary drink alternatives Potter is looking to continue innovating his product and business practices and expand restaurant partnerships. For restaurants “pushing the envelope on health and wellness” Potter tells Food Tank “carrying our beverages is making a difference.”

The Bengals erased an 18-point deficit to take a late 24-21 lead but Harrison Butker's 44-yard field goal as time expired in regulation sent it to overtime a week after his 49-yarder on the final play of regulation did the same against Buffalo.

Vonn Bell intercepted Mahomes on the third play of overtime and Burrow and the Bengals took over.

The Bengals (13-7) will play the winner of the NFC championship between San Francisco and the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl in Los Angeles on Feb. 13. Cincinnati lost to the 49ers in both of its previous trips to the Super Bowl.

Mahomes and the Chiefs (14-6) will be left to lament blowing a chance at a third straight Super Bowl appearance. They had a chance at a winning touchdown in the closing seconds of regulation but sacks by Sam Hubbard on consecutive plays forced Kansas City to settle for the tying field goal.

Bhavan’s SPJIMR saw a 23% jump in average salary to Rs 32.05 lakh with 59% of the offers above or equal to Rs 30 lakh; IIM Indore had a record-breaking average salary of Rs 25.01 lakh.Highest packages across these campuses also saw an upswing. At MDI Gurgaon the top offer this time was around Rs 80 lakh a nearly 82% jump over last year’s Rs 44 lakh. In IIM Kozhikode it went up by over 28% to Rs 61.5 lakh (international) up from last year’s Rs 48 lakh.“Placements have been exceptionally good this time; industry is not bothered by the third wave. The appetite for hiring is much higher than the last two years” says Amit K Gupta lead- graduate programme placements at MDI where the average salary is around Rs 25 lakh for the graduating batch. All companies have upgraded salary packages and the institute has had to refuse many firms who were keen to recruit he says.Campuses say that not only are regular recruiters hiring in large numbers but there has also been a significant surge in first-time recruiters. Boston Consulting Group Bain and Co McKinsey & Co Cognizant Accenture PwC Deloitte Amazon and ITC were among prominent recruiters across campuses.“Consulting sector has been on a hiring spree this year. More fintech companies are recruiting and product management is another role which is in big demand” says Qambar Abidi placements chairperson at IIM Kozhikode.As the pandemic accelerated a push towards digitalisation the placements reflected the new trend.“While the IT/Analytics domain itself saw a boost in recruitment even other domains like finance marketing operations and strategy are witnessing roles being offered that have a higher digital flavour than ever before. This is representative of the overall shift in industry focus” said Himanshu Rai director IIM Indore.The euphoria has spilled over into other campuses as well. IIT Kanpur’s MBA programme has had a 22.5% growth in average salary this year breaking all previous records. Symbiosis Institute of Operations Management at Nashik has also seen a strong run.Top institutes where placements are yet to wrap up vouch for the same bullishness. “The overall placement trend shows that the hiring market is upward.

MAREA is Malaysia’s first-ever Extended Producer Responsibility (ERP) association and is chaired by Nestle Malaysia CEO Juan Aranols. The association was established in January 2021 but only just recently saw its formal launch on January 21 2022.

The alliance’s members comprise of 10 well-known FMCG brands in Malaysia - Coca-Cola Colgate-Palmolive Dutch Lady Milk Industries Etika Group of Companies F&N Malaysia Mondelēz International (Malaysia) Nestlé Malaysia Spritzer Tetra Pak Malaysia and Unilever Malaysia.

Although not all of its members are from the food and beverage industry the alliance revealed during its launch that food and beverage packaging will make up over half of its Phase One focus which will include four plastic materials: PET (beverage bottles) Multi-layer laminates/flexibles (soft plastics e.g. instant noodle and biscuit packaging) Used Beverage Cartons (UBC milk and juice cartons) in addition to HDPE which is usually used for shampoo bottles.

“Although we can be fierce competitors in the market we also know that working together is necessary to address the plastic challenge that faces us [as] together we manufacture daily products for millions of consumers”​ said Aranols at the launch event.

“Estimations say that the APAC region will accumulate some 40 million tons of plastic waste by 2030 and Malaysia is expected to play a large part in this [if we continue as is] so we must do more. ​

“At present plastic still plays an important role in the food supply chain by bringing food to consumers safely – it is a necessary part of the packaging to ensure food safety especially in our warm humid climate. We are looking for alternative materials but we also need to change the way we interact with plastic towards a circular economy to reduce environmental impact.”​

Research by the World Bank Group and local ministries have shown that Malaysia produces some 1.1 million tons of plastic waste each year and a WWF report also revealed that it takes the second top spot in Asia for per capita plastic use (16.78kg) beating out larger countries such as China and Indonesia.

Ministers from the local Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) as well as the Ministry of Environment and Water (KASA) were also present to formally launch MAREA and both minister highlighted the importance of waste reduction in light of the recent flood tragedy to hit the country last December.

“It is especially important to take immediate action to mitigate the plastic waste situation especially after the recent floods – this should be taken as an eye-opener for us all towards the threat of climate change and to highlight the critical importance for Malaysia to transform towards a net zero emissions country”​ KASA Minister Dato' Sri Tuan Ibrahim Bin Tuan Man said at the event.

“This EPR is in line with Malaysia’s 2030 national sustainability goals within the Plastic Sustainability Framework 2021-2030 – one of the core strategies in that framework is the implementation of mandatory EPRs and reaching 25% plastic packaging recycling rates by 2025 – similar to MAREA’s goal.”​

Practical plans of action​

Amongst MAREA’s practical plans are to establish curbside collection systems to do weekly collections from select households in addition to promoting Separation At Source (SAS) by consumers via consumer education initiatives and working with recyclers to stabilise collection costs via subsidisation.

“The 25% of plastic waste is estimated to translate into some 20000 MT of plastic being recycled by 2025 based on our current 10 members – but we are recruiting more FMCG firms such as Danone and P&G to join us which will hopefully bump this number up even higher” ​MAREA General Manager Pauline Goh said in response to queries from FoodNavigator-Asia​ at a post-event press conference.

“Before that though our short-term goal within this year is to first recycle at least 5000 MT of plastic waste.”​

Aranols added that MAREA is an open organization not just limited to manufacturers and called for players all along the value supply chain to join them.

“We’re not just looking for big firms but also small food companies for example retailers and any other organisations along the value chain who can play a role in plastic reduction”​ he said.

Goh also said that there are plans in motion for the monetary incentivization of B40 households (Malaysians in the lowest 40% income group) to recycle but hopes to use education to get other members of the public to do this as it will be ‘more sustainable in the long run’.​

“We will also be auditing everything we do all the plastic waste that enters MAREA will be recorded – we want to establish a robust data collection and auditing system so we can prepare a proper report for both members and likely the government on a regular basis”​ she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS9zbWJzdG9yeS9hcHBhcmVscy1hcnRpc2FuYWwtaG9tZS1kZWNvci1icmFuZC1zbWFsbC1idXNpbmVzcy1zdWNjZXNzLXN0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From apparel to artisanal home decor the top SMB Stories this week,"India is home to many brands.

“Textiles run in my blood” says Sarabjeet Saluja aka Sabby.

Having observed his father Kuldeep Saluja toiling his way up to build a prominent apparel brand Sahiba Limited Sabby says he always knew he wanted to be in this business.

And so after returning from Australia in 2009 he immediately joined the Surat-based family business in December the same year.

While Sahiba is now an established Indian apparel brand Sabby was itching to do something different that would add value to the larger group.

This led him to launch ﻿Saundh India﻿ in 2019 with Rs 10 crore — a plan that was under progress since 2016. “We wanted to make something on the lines of Zara but in ethnic wear” he says adding he was looking at the brand to have an international appeal as well.

He says “Sahiba has been competing mostly with the informal and formal sector in India. But the thing that has been troubling us is we have not been able to compete with Indonesian and Korean brands which have a big export market” he highlights.

He hopes to achieve this through Saundh India.

Saundh India offers tops kurtis jackets kurta sets (both stitched and unstitched) loungewear and more. Items like scarves and masks are priced below Rs 2000 but the clothes begin from Rs 3000 onwards. In FY21 the brand clocked Rs 30 crore turnover claims Sabby. Sahiba's turnover in FY20 was Rs 448 crore.

Blessed with a rich crafts heritage India’s art forms are famous all over the world for their intricacy and attention to detail. Moreover each region inherits a plethora of unique art forms that may not be known to the outside world.

Thirty-four-years-old Arpita Sahu also realised the same when she came back from the US after working with multiple corporations like The Coca-Cola Company and Colgate-Palmolive.

“When I came back to Odisha after a few stints outside I realised there is immense talent in my homeland with Pattachitra being one of the most beautiful and intricate detailed art forms. I always had a creative side to me which was left unexplored. So I jumped at the first opportunity of starting a creative business when I discovered the immense scope of our Indian folk art forms” says Arpita in an interview with SMBStory.

Arpita established Bhubaneswar-based ﻿Vintage Vistara﻿ in 2019. She claims within the next few months her company aims to touch a revenue of Rs 1 crore.

Gaurav Bhagat remembers when his grandfather and father had to shutter their successful ceramics factory on the outskirts of Kolkata back in the 70s during the communist uprisings in West Bengal. His family was forced to leave Kolkata with nothing but a few suitcases and some clothes he recalls.

The do-or-die situation that had presented itself when Gaurav was growing up forced him to think of ways he could salvage the state of affairs and help his family stand on its own two feet. He withdrew Rs 10000 on the credit card he had on him at the time and started a gifting company called Consortium Gifts.

It wasn’t a last-ditch effort by any means — entrepreneurship ran in the 21-year-old’s veins.

Gaurav’s first venture was a stock market game he had created at the age of 16 which was later bought by Leo Toys and the young entrepreneur was paid a royalty on every game Leo sold.

Still a lot was riding on Consortium Gifts when it was founded.

Today Consortium Gifts does Rs 30 crore in revenue is present in six Indian cities and has over 80 employees. It dominates the corporate gifting segment in the country and has exclusive tie-ups with brands like Puma Shantanu & Nikhil Swarovski Brand Charger and Boardroom among others.

Gaurav recalls when he was still building Consortium Gifts he met Grant Cardone a notable international businessman speaker and owner of $1.5 billion investment company Cardone Capital in the US.

The billionaire investor had been training Consortium Gifts’ employees — especially his sales staff — in all the ways they could take the company from 10X to 100X and Gaurav realised the content he used in those training sessions was ""game-changing"".

“At that point it struck me like a ton of bricks that surely money and success alone couldn’t be my purpose and there had to be more that I was meant to do” he says.

Combining his passion for business selling and growing with his newfound zest to do more Gaurav realised smaller businesses like him can replicate and even exceed the success he had seen with Consortium Gifts.

In 2018 he founded the ﻿Gaurav Bhagat Academy﻿ a training institute to help deliver quality lessons in growing and scaling businesses.

Comcast's latest Q4 earnings report outlines strong revenues and a confident roadmap for its content services including Peacock. NBC Universal's streaming service Peacock currently has 9 million paid subscribers since launching in 2020 which extremely low compared to Netflix (221.8 million) and Disney+ (118 million).

Peacock isn't playing by Netflix's or Disney's rules though. The service has three options: A free tier with ads a $4.99 paid tier with reduced ads and a premium $9.99 tier with no ads. Peacock Premium offers exclusive access to megahit shows like The Office whereas the free tier is limited. Comcast believes strongly in this premium-free combo.

Comcast is also continuing to spend big on Peacock shelling out a $1.2 billion content budget in 2021. Spending will double to over $3 billion in 2022. Peacock isn't yet profitable and lost $1.7 billion last year most of which was from the huge spending allowance.

Comcast CEO Brian Roberts discusses Peacock in the Q4 earnings call:

""When we introduced Peacock to you back in early 2020 our vision was to launch a streaming service that offers premium content and is supported primarily by advertising. What we've learned so far is that we started with the right business model. With over 300 million hours of content consumed on Peacock per month the engagement with our platform has proven extremely valuable to advertisers. ""We have another 7 million highly engaged bundled subscribers from Xfinity and other top distributors who use Peacock every single month and currently receive Peacock Premium at no extra cost. We expect strong conversion of this group to paid subscribers over time.""

CyberCrunch is totally bent on destruction.

Its two plants in Aston and out west in Greensburg Pa. are places where familiar electronics from Philadelphia’s biggest employers go to die.

More precisely to be shredded into high-tech confetti that data thieves can’t pillage then sold to recyclers.

The more digitized and data-dependent our working lives become the more “everyone ends up with equipment they will have to dispose of” noted Joe Connors head of business development at Aston-based CyberCrunch.

Electronics recycling has a history of rising and falling with precious-metals prices. But Connors said his company has built new shredders — such as one it calls the Cyber 10G Pulverizer — in a bet that working-from-home the Internet of Things smartphones that communicate directly with remote “cloud” servers and other trends will boost demand for years to come.

As computers and phones have gotten faster smarter smaller and ubiquitous — and as laws such as HIPAA  for medical privacy and Gramm-Leach-Bliley for accounting spawn policies mandating privacy protections — employers have had to ensure that their destroyers can break ever-more-efficient equipment into ever-smaller pieces.

Penn and Jefferson Comcast and DuPont Clarivate and Sungard and other firms that rely on hand-held and laptop communications and data access — as well as digital-tech-dependent retailers such as the 900 Wawa stores — need places to dispose of old devices and any traces of private or proprietary data.

That’s where CyberCrunch with its 25 employees at a newly enlarged 45000-square-foot facility in Aston and at a 45000-square-foot center with larger machines in Greensburg find cash in sophisticated trash.

It’s not a big-dollar business — companies pay as little as $4000 a year for the service and the firm’s revenues totaled less than $5 million last year.

But it has grown since state-backed Ben Franklin Technology Partners and other investors pumped in an initial $325000 five years ago when the company changed its name from Commonwealth Computer Recycling.

Private investors have paid to help cofounder Serdar Bankaci a data scientist based at the company’s Greensburg plant in Western Pennsylvania to develop and build new machines.

His colleagues said Bankaci is famous in the industry for hearing the year and model of a piece of equipment — mainframe PC phone — and instantly reporting back the current value of its components on the ever-changing spot markets: “Trash this trash that that’s worth $2 that’s worth $50” quoted Connors mimicking the boss.

For some clients “CyberCrunch takes out the wires certain memory cards and metals — they charge us by the pound but they include [calculations] for the gold platinum aluminum they recover” which the company will strip and re-sell said Joe Boccella senior technical support engineer at Sungard Availability Services in Wayne. Sungard helps corporate clients plan computer use and backups to keep systems reliable.

Electronics scrapping has evolved said Boccella from the “mainframe” computer days when companies ran IBM or Unisys machines in-house. “All the connecters were gold” and owners would remove and sell those bits and remove memory chips to pass them between magnets to wipe out sensitive data before sending the “heavy iron” to the junkyard Boccella recalled.

But machines have gotten more complex with data lingering in surprising nodes: “You can no longer pass a magnet over a hard drive and think you’re safe” Boccella warned. “Magnetize it reformat it but they can still pull out old data. You have to have it ground into pieces.”

Especially at the end of each year when new corporate equipment at such vendors as Sungard tends to replace the obsolete. “Three days before Christmas CyberCrunch took out three major box trucks of hardware” Boccella said. “They can’t re-use our hardware. They need to take our name off the serial numbers and make sure it dissolves.”

There are even some Sungard clients that continued to use magnetic tapes for years after most companies began relying on remote servers. That’s not because they can’t afford the “cloud” of distant servers such as Amazon Web Services or its rivals from Google or specialty operators such as Philadelphia-based Linode. Rather it’s because they considered old technology that was isolated from the Internet to be safer.

But mostly today’s data business is subject to relentless device upgrades to keep it current with network volume speed and security needs. For desktops laptops and phones the standard is a three-year cycle. “We have a lot of equipment for our clients — every flavor of computer system from mainframes down every brand from IBM to Hitachi to EMC — that we have to destroy” said Boccella. ”We rotate our hardware. We have a lot of hard drives. We need a good distributor to trash them.”

Sungard also does some of its own smashing and shredding. So Boccella checks prices and contracts out the work if a contractor such as CyberCrunch can do it more efficiently. Old insulators with polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs) and other caustic or toxic chemicals carelessly disposed “can get you in trouble with the EPA” he warned. “A vendor like CyberCrunch has all the credentials; it makes them an easy choice for those jobs.”

Philadelphia once a center of innovative manufacturing is now an important recycling center located in the middle of the East Coast megalopolis convenient to rails and highways linking to the Midwest and inland South. CyberCrunch sells data-free scrap to specialized recyclers such as Revolution Recovery Camden Iron & Metal and Burns & Co. which can recycle entire buildings.

When big companies such as DuPont downsize in mergers the office clean-outs can yield tons of specialized tools with valuable components. Last summer “they delivered to us a nuclear electron microscope. Two thousand pounds and none of it goes to a landfill. We separate the parts and send them to our downstream” recyclers Connors said.

“Who gets sent to destroy data” at a large company or nonprofit hospital? asked Al Paoletti who handles large corporate accounts for CyberCrunch. “The guy lowest on the totem pole. Maybe the intern. They are overworked so many institutions have cut staff dramatically. So we come in where they have left off we check their work and identify the problem” and cut deals. He said an international push picked up clients in 15 countries last year.

Special to the Detroit Free Press

“If you are fortunate enough to wake up in the morning you have two choices. You can spend your day being happy or you can spend it being unhappy. … Ultimately the choice is yours.”

— Fred Buchalter author of “My Unexpected Life The Extraordinary Journey of An Ordinary Man”

For a third winter many of us are staying home to stay safe. We dress as if every day is Casual Friday and our outings are mostly to the market and drugstore to search for hard-to-find items like COVID-19 test kits and Styrofoam cups. Shelves are often empty and we sometimes find ourselves searching our souls as we search for missing products. To put it simply many of us no longer feel as if our cups are half full.

No wonder Americans are quitting work in record numbers. From April through November of last year 32.7 million of them voluntarily left their jobs. The pandemic has prompted large numbers of people — particularly those with years of work already behind them — to reassess not just their careers but also their lives.

Count the four metro Detroiters featured in this article among them. One is a former radio man with a longtime yearning to write. Another is a banker-turned-baker. Still another is a grandmother who's resuming the college student life she left behind decades ago. Their dreams deferred are being converted into dreams come true because all found the courage to ask ""If not now … when?""

Fred Buchalter: 'I now had the time'

Troy resident Fred Buchalter’s memoir titled “My Unexpected Life The Extraordinary Journey of An Ordinary Man” proves he is anything but ordinary. His passion to pursue his dreams and how he achieved each one is nothing short of extraordinary. Writing a book is just his latest triumph.

Buchalter 72 spent his career in Detroit radio in many roles including serving as music director at WCZY-FM (known then as ""Cozy FM""). He also worked on Detroit radio veteran Dick Purtan’s morning show and later for WWJ-AM. At the same time he was working in theater as an actor and singer. This spring he will begin rehearsals on his 100th production with Michigan Opera Theatre.

Buchalter thought about writing his book when he retired from radio six years ago but never had enough time until ""the pandemic came and everything else was taken away from me” he said. “I now had the time to sit down and begin to write. Every morning I met friends for coffee at Ridley’s Bakery Cafe in Troy. I would bring my laptop and start writing after everyone else had left.”

From Mondays through Fridays he spent three or four hours every day writing while hanging out at the bakery's patio which became his office. He completed his 26-chapter 272-page memoir in six months.

Then he said: “I had no clue what to do. I had never before written anything intending to publish. This was a first and I had no idea how to do mass publishing.”

In the end Buchalter self-published the book last May and began marketing it the old-fashioned way: He keeps his inventory in his car and sells his books from there. He's available weekday mornings at Ridley's. “It’s only for sale in the back of my car or if you email me” he said noting that he printed 110 books and has so far sold 85.

And the reaction? “My friends who suggested I write a book have told me they admire my courage at being so forthcoming so honest” he said explaining that he saw ""no point in writing the book"" unless he was candid — and that he hopes his candor will benefit others.

“If my story inspires one person to follow his or her heart … I will consider it worth the effort.”

Will Rawls: 'Identify your passion'

Many of us have been doing casual baking during the pandemic but banker Will Rawls has been pursuing it like a man on a mission. On Facebook where he posts photos of his pastry creations he is known as Yo Baker Man.

Rawls 60 of Farmington Hills is a senior analyst with Comerica Bank’s institutional trust group and is working remotely from home. In his free time he helps others in his dream project Baking Angel.

At the beginning of the pandemic he just wanted to do something nice for the front-line workers in the emergency room at Beaumont Hospital Farmington Hills by providing some of his home-baked goods. “I dropped off my pastry trays to show my appreciation” he said.

Then with help from colleagues at Comerica Rawls expanded his idea and Baking Angel was born. Healthful boxed lunches were added to Rawls' baked goods and delivered to front-line workers at Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak and Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit as well as Beaumont in Farmington Hills. Rawls and his Comerica colleagues later delivered lunches and pastries to the Wayne County sheriff’s office.

Rawls' desserts included his famous Oreo cheesecake muffins sweet potato squares lemon blueberry muffins marbled fudge bars and chocolate-almond toffee. All his pastries given to first responders have a thank-you sticker.

“The joy in the faces and reactions have made me so very happy. I cannot put into words how much it has meant to me” he said.

Rawls learned how to bake from his beloved Aunt Gladys who could ""bake the paint off the walls” he recalled. ""My passion comes from her."" One day he'd like to write a book on baking and dedicate it to his beloved aunt.

His more immediate goal is to help more first responders in the spring after recovering from his recent knee surgery and to continue baking his cheesecakes for family and friends.

“You have to identify your passion"" he said. ""Don’t sit and wish and hope. By trade I am a banker. For fun I am a baker.”

Duffy Flynn Wineman: 'I now have a 4.0'

Nearly 50 years after she was a campus coed Duffy Flynn Wineman of Bloomfield Hills is pursuing her dream of getting her bachelor's degree in theater. Now 68 and a mother of three sons and eight grandchildren she is taking five courses this semester at Wayne State University and intends to graduate one week before her 70th birthday.

“I sat on the couch watching Netflix during COVID and doing nothing and I started to think about my bucket list. I realized how much I want my college degree. I would like my children and grandchildren to come to my graduation.”

Wayne State gave her every opportunity to achieve her dream.

“My Wayne State academic adviser is so incredible"" she said. “They were so inviting. They were so supportive. They encouraged me to get my degree and said ‘You need to do this!’ And they walked me through everything. They showed me how to do my application and how to obtain my college transcripts from almost 50 years ago.

Wayne State gives 16 credit hours for life experience so I could apply my years as a volunteer drama teacher. They also give a 75% discount on tuition costs if you are a senior citizen and of course I am.”

It will cost Wineman between $12000 and $15000 to complete her degree.

“The kids in my classes are very accepting of me” she said. “One day I was onstage and fumbled my line (my nemesis) and let out a very loud expletive. I dropped the F-bomb. One of the kids came up to me and said 'You are the coolest grandma!’”

Wineman who left college as a junior to marry and have children was widowed as a young mother at age 44. She has spent decades acting in community theater and St. Dunstan's Theatre Guild of Cranbrook is her ""home away from home.""

She has been a devoted community volunteer an antiques dealer and received her Michigan Residential Builder’s License. Now wherever she goes on campus someone knows her. This includes the faculty. “The chair of the department sent me an email” she said. “He wanted to tell me how happy they are to have me for the energy I bring to the program.” After each class Wineman thanks her professors. Her young classmates are in awe of her.

“One of the young men in my acting class said to me: ‘You know you are famous here; they are talking about you in my dorm. I told everyone I am doing a scene with you and they said how lucky I am.’”

But what about her grandkids? What do they think? Her oldest is 16 and now looking at future colleges. Wineman asked her advice on whether she should buy a messenger bag or a backpack.

“My granddaughter said ‘Wait a minute you are going to be on campus?’ She thought I was just doing an online educational program. … I now have a backpack so I don’t look like the little old lady.”

Though she's well on her way to achieving a dream Wineman acknowledges “I have had a couple of hard weeks where I said ‘I am too old for this.’ Then I turned it around and I now have a 4.0 GPA!”

Joe Borri: 'No promise on tomorrow'

The pandemic has given Joe Borri of Farmington Hills the time he wanted and needed to pursue his life dream: painting.

""Because I can now paint every day I feel closer to how I felt when I was young"" said Borri 59. ""I feel the excitement again. I have a renewed vigor and a renewed hope that I can actually continue to do what I started out to do when I graduated as an art student.""

In the early years of his career Borri worked as an illustrator and did freelance work for the Free Press in the 1980s. He also worked as a consultant and manager in commercial art and design and as a digital imaging director. He's now working with former Detroit Lion Herman Moore's company as a creative concept producer designing greeting cards and other products.

Open heart surgery in 2018 changed Borri's life.

""After rehab I came back to work and three months later I lost my job"" he recalled. ""It was hard finding another position then COVID hit and it seemed all the jobs were scarce. Painting helped bring money in as I worked other jobs to help pay bills.""

The pandemic ""has been an opportunity to get back in touch with what I love doing most and find joy in"" he said. ""I was also inspired by my daughter. She came back home during the pandemic. She is a practicing engineer and an artist. Watching her paint every day became a springboard for me.""

Borri the son of a Detroit policeman has always followed his dreams — and succeeded. In 2007 he wrote and published ""Eight Dogs Named Jack: And Fourteen Other Stories from the Detroit Streets and Michigan Wilderness"" a collection of his short stories and illustrations. Over the years people in the entertainment industry in both New York City and Detroit have commissioned him to paint portraits of artists like Jimi Hendrix Amy Winehouse and Eminem.

At present the Northville Gallery and Frameworks in Plymouth feature his paintings while corporations are commissioning him to do oil paintings for their lobbies and friends are hiring him to paint their pets.

Borri feels the events of last three years have put his life in perspective.

“If you wait too long there is no promise on tomorrow"" he said. ""There is an opportunity for all of us to think about what we are put on this earth to do. Why not make it happen?”

El ‘Orejas’ felizmente respondió dentro del campo.

Edison Flores era parte de la base que tenía Ricardo Gareca para encarar estas Eliminatorias a Qatar 2022; sin embargo la llegada de la pandemia y las lesiones lo alejaron de la selección peruana.

A pesar de ello Ricardo Gareca cada vez que pudo lo convocó. Edison Flores estuvo presente en la segunda fecha doble de las Eliminatorias a Qatar 2022. No tuvo una gran actuación en la derrota de Perú ante Chile y Argentina. El volante fue uno de los más criticados.

Cuando recién comenzaba a tener minutos las lesiones le jugaron en contra al ‘Orejas’. El 25 de agosto del 2020 Edison Flores sufrió una fuerte fractura en la cara en pleno partido entre DC United. Superó ese mal momento y cuando estaba listo para regresar a la selección apareció otro problema.

El 23 de mayo del 2021 Edison Flores se rompió el bíceps femoral proximal del tendón de la corva. Esta nueva lesión lo alejó 79 días de las canchas . Su regreso fue en el triunfo de Perú por 2-0 ante Chile. Lamentablemente no tuvo un buen partido y terminó lesionado.

Edison Flores volvió a jugar en el partido amistoso entre Perú vs. Panamá. En aquel encuentro terminó golpeado. Fue duramente criticado en redes sociales y cuestionaban su convocatoria. Sin embargo Ricardo Gareca le brindó toda la confianza.

-EL RESPALDO DE GARECA-

Ricardo Gareca convocó a Edison Flores para los partidos ante Colombia y Ecuador. Es cierto no lo puso desde el inicio ante el combinado cafetero; sin embargo le dio todo el segundo tiempo y respondió de la mejor manera.

En Barranquilla vimos al Edison Flores que tanto extrañábamos. Como decía Daniel Peredo fue el “número 20 que jugaba para 10 puntos”. Ayudó en la marca hizo el recorrido ayudando a Marcos López y selló su tarde marcando un gol.

Me pone muy contento por él porque para nosotros es fundamental. Hoy volvió al gol. En las Eliminatorias a Rusia fue el segundo goleador del equipo. Encontrarse con un tanto nos levanta y a él también” declaró Ricardo Gareca.

El técnico de la selección peruana está más que contentó porque no se olvida aquella Eliminatorias a Rusia 2018. Edison Flores jugó 12 partidos de las Eliminatorias a Rusia 2018 10 de ellos los hizo como titular y marcó 5 goles. Fue uno de los máximos artilleros de la blanquirroja junto a Paolo Guerrero.

El gol de Edison Flores a Colombia es un buen presagio para la selección peruana. El volante que no hizo soñar con Rusia 2018 nos acercó con su tanto a Qatar 2022. Aun quedan 3 finales y el Orejita está listo para afrontarlas.

Perú se acerca al Mundial

Gracias a la victoria el elenco comandado por Ricardo Gareca llegó a 20 puntos y subió al cuarto casillero de la tabla. De esta manera a falta de tres jornadas para el final del certamen la ‘Bicolor’ hoy estaría obteniendo un boleto para la próxima Copa del Mundo.

“La figura del partido es el equipo. Lo que metió el equipo lo que corrió cómo manejó el partido. Es increíble. Estoy orgulloso de todos mis compañeros y todavía falta” señaló Gallese al finalizar el cotejo en entrevista con Caracol TV.

Para intentar acercarse al sueño mundialista Perú deberá sumar de a tres este martes 1 de febrero ante Ecuador en el Estadio Nacional de Lima. El choque está pactado para las 9:00 p.m. (hora peruana).

La selección peruana venció a su similar de Colombia (1-0) y consiguió tres puntos importantes en su lucha por ir al mundial Qatar 2022. Hinchas colombianos mostraron su desazón por el resultado y esperan revertir la situación.

Christian Cueva fue uno de los jugadores más importantes del Perú vs Colombia: propició el pase para que Edison ‘Oreja’ Flores pusiera el tanto de la victoria en el Metropolitano de Barranquilla por la fecha 15 de las Eliminatorias Qatar 2022. Ahora la bicolor se encuentra en zona de clasificación directa a Qatar con 20 puntos en la tabla de posiciones.

A través de Twitter se difundió un video en el cual el volante de la ‘Blanquirroja’ le dedicó una canción a Yerry Mina que fue uno de los defensas colombianos que perdió el último viernes.

“Oye Yerry Mina oye Yerry Mina oye Yerry Mina yo te voy a dar tu chocolatito con tu panetón” cantó Christian Cueva en una versión modificada de ‘Mix Valentina’ del Grupo 5.

Pese a que el video de ‘Aladino’ se convirtió en viral en las redes sociales se desconoce si las imágenes son pasadas o fueron después del Perú vs Colombia sobre todo después que el exdefensa del Barcelona se burló de la selección peruana previo al encuentro por las Eliminatorias Qatar 2022.

“Sabemos que a Perú le gusta el chocolate por eso el viernes van a probar el verdadero chocolate” dijo el jugador del Everton de la Premier League.

Perú ganó 1-0 con gol de Edison ‘Oreja’ Flores a los 85′ en el Metropolitano de Barranquilla y se ubica en posición directa de clasificación para el Mundial Qatar 2022. La ‘Blanquirroja’ enfrenta a Ecuador este martes 1 de febrero a las 9:00 p.m. en el Estadio Nacional.

CUEVA NO ESTARÁ ANTE ECUADOR

Christian Cueva no estará en el Perú vs Ecuador por la jornada 16 de las Eliminatorias Qatar 2022 por acumulación de tarjetas amarillas debido a que fue amonestado frente a Colombia.

El volante de la selección peruana quiso cortar una jugada a James Rodríguez y fue amonestado con una tarjeta amarilla por lo que el entrenador Ricardo Gareca tendrá que reordenar las posiciones en la bicolor para que no se sienta la ausencia de ‘Cuevita’ pilar en el once del ‘Tigre’.

Christian Cueva se encuentra en el top 10 de los máximos artilleros de la tabla de goleadores de las Eliminatorias Qatar 2022 que aún lidera el boliviano Marcelo Martins con 9 goles en la finalización de la fecha 15 donde Perú ganó 1-0 a Colombia.

‘Aladino’ tiene 5 anotaciones hasta el momento: consiguió anotarle dos veces a Venezuela y le marcó a Bolivia Chile y Ecuador.

The mission’s goal was to demonstrate the viability of PocketQube-scale nanosatellites that operate reliably without batteries eliminating the cost and complexity of battery-based power systems in smallsats. The sensor-equipped 5 cm. cube (1/8 the size of a cubesat) can sense its environment and perform orbital edge computing to process sensor data in a way that is robust to intermittent operation.

Alba Orbital in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA) has developed a flight proven 3p PocketQube platform called Unicorn-2. The goal of the platform is to get 3U cubesat performance on a PocketQube.

During the mission the satellite collected telemetry data about its operation (power state stored energy GPS location) and collected and processed sensor data about its environment using applications such as machine learning and inference. The results were sent back to Earth using a low-power radio.

Falcon 9’s first stage booster previously launched Crew Demo-2 ANASIS-II CRS-21 Transporter-1 and five Starlink missions. Transporter-3 is SpaceX’s third dedicated rideshare mission and on board this launch were 105 spacecraft (including cubesats microsats PocketQubes and orbital transfer vehicles (OTV)).

“Our lab developed the Tartan-Artibeus-1 Satellite which is what we believe to be the world’s first battery-less PocketQube nanosatellite” said Brandon Lucia an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering. “This project was led by Ph.D. students Brad Denby and Emily Ruppel from my lab and in collaboration with Alba Orbital our launch services provider.”

“A unique aspect of this mission was that while on orbit the satellite ran Cote a physics-based orbital dynamics model and orbital edge computing simulator that we developed giving the satellite better situational awareness without the need to communicate to earth” said Lucia. “This battery-less satellite is the first of its kind and we are very excited for the new scientific results enabled by this unique deployment to Earth’s orbit.”

Here's where to see it.,"The James Webb Space Telescope's first target a star named HD 84406 is located in the constellation Ursa Major near the Big Dipper.

The James Webb Space Telescope is setting its eyes towards the Big Dipper.

Although the spacecraft is still months away from beginning its official scientific observations one particularly bright star named HD 84406 will soon be the object of JWST's attention.

""Star light star bright … the first star Webb will see is HD 84406 a sun-like star about 260 light years away"" NASA officials tweeted on Friday (Jan. 28) via JWST's official Twitter account.

HD 84406 is located in the constellation Ursa Major which means ""Big Bear"" in Latin. The Big Dipper asterism (or star pattern) is actually part of this constellation and it's the tail of this furry beast. The star has a visual magnitude of about 6.9 which is too dim to see with the naked eye. To see the star you'll need a telescope or high-power binoculars. Here's our guide for the best telescopes for 2022 and our guide for the best binoculars may help you find the right pair to hunt Webb's star.

Now that JWST has reached its final destination in space the mission team is getting the next-generation space telescope prepped for observations. A bright point like HD 84406 provides a helpful target by which the team can align JWST's honeycomb-shaped mirrors and to start gathering engineering data according to the tweet.

This star will play an important role for this specific purpose but it won't be studied by the observatory once it officially begins its science projects.

""HD 84406 will be too bright to study with Webb once the telescope starts to come into focus. But for now it is the perfect target to begin our search for photons a search that will lead us to the distant universe"" according to a NASA blog post published on Thursday (Jan. 27) written by Jonathan Gardner Webb deputy senior project scientist from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Alexandra Lockwood project scientist for Webb science communications at Space Telescope Science Institute.

In addition to JWST placing itself in its observational perch this week has marked another important development for JWST. According to the blog post the team has also turned on JWST's High-Gain Antenna and it can now downlink observations via the Deep Space Network's Ka radio band a channel that ""provides a much higher data rate"" to download science images and data for astronomers to analyze.

Now try wrapping your noodle around the enormous beauty of three galaxies side by side.

NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured one such stunning scene in an image shared with the public on Saturday. NGC 7764A as the galaxies are collectively known is roughly 425 million light-years away from Earth in the Phoenix constellation.

We can see two of the three galaxies interacting in the upper right corner of the image. Their long trails of gas and stars ""give the impression that they have both just been struck at great speed"" the image's official write-up explains. In actuality interactions between two galaxies are estimated to take as many as half a billion years from start to finish.

The third ""bowling-ball-shaped"" galaxy may also be interacting with its apparent neighbors. ""They are so relatively close in space that it seems possible that they are"" the explainer continues.

The trio's picture was taken using a combination of the Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys and its Wide Field Camera 3. Both are powerful high-resolution systems designed to capture images of objects in deep space.

Earlier in 2022 NASA shared a similar image which appeared to show galaxy NGC 105 colliding with another galaxy much further away. But that NASA pointed out was an optical illusion.

Individually the star systems shown in this image are known as NGC 7764A1 NGC 7764A2 and NGC 7764A3.

Developed by researchers from the University of Surrey in concert with the folks at Space Power the new project hopes to solve an issue that plagues all satellites that spend time out of the sun’s direct view by transferring power from illuminated satellites using laser beams.

BACKGROUND: SOLAR POWER IS A SPACECRAFT STAPLE

Most artificial satellites use solar power to power their onboard systems. However satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) experience prolonged periods in the Earth’s shadow robbing them of critical charging time. This problem is increasingly prevalent as commercial ventures like Starlink plan to send thousands of new satellites into LEO in the coming years.

Now the University of Surrey and Space Power teams think they have a viable solution even if it sounds like it’s right out of a James Bond (or Austin Powers) Movie.

ANALYSIS: FRIGGIN’ SATELLITES WITH FRIGGIN’ LASER BEAMS!

According to the press release announcing the venture “By collaborating on a space infrastructure project the joint team will develop new technology which uses lasers to beam solar power from satellites under solar illumination to small satellites orbiting closer to Earth during eclipse.”

Of course lasers on satellites are commonplace in the world of fiction but in real life using this novel technology to transfer power between satellites would be a first.

“The University of Surrey has a long track record in photonics and space research and brings unique expertise in both high power lasers and photovoltaics technologies” said Professor of Physics at the University of Surrey Stephen Sweeney in the press release. “We have many years of experience in optical wireless power and are delighted to work with Space Power to help develop such technologies for space-based applications.”

Part of the U.K.’s government-sponsored Space Research and Innovation Network for Technology (SPRINT) program the project hopes to tap into the respective areas of expertise to design the systems that will conduct the inter-satellite power transfer.

For the University of Surrey team this means using the highly specialized laser laboratories and optical systems developed at the University’s Department of Physics and Advanced Technology Institute “which are world leaders in the development and implementation of laser and photovoltaic-based technologies.”

Space Power’s expertise will lie in bringing a commercially viable project to market that is “a plug-and-play system for satellite manufacturers to include in their offering to their LEO constellation customers.”

“The SPRINT project is an important development from our feasibility study with the University of Surrey that enables us to approach customers with confidence and demonstrate the improved efficiencies available by using auxiliary power systems” said Keval Dattani Director of Space Power. “By focusing on light optics and power beaming we are looking to increase small satellite operating efficiencies by a factor of between 2X-5X.”

OUTLOOK: LASER BEAMS FOR POWER MAY BE OPERABLE BY 2025

Although there is no announced timeline for the completion of the project the press release indicates that the teams will develop the prototype without the government and with plans to commercialize the product by 2025. Plus the folks from Space Power note that they can scale this system up to provide power for future space colonists or even projects closer to home.

“We have seen the benefits of powering satellites by laser which enables smaller satellites simpler systems and fewer resources – whilst performing more work to help us understand our planet better” said Dattani. “For us this is a neat solution with long-term benefits not least for lunar outposts and asteroid mining but back here on earth too.”

When you think of composites picture throwing one two or more seemingly basic clothing items together to create a fabulously uniform ensemble. A composite material created from two or more materials with different properties typically fiber and resin is combined to act in concert. Fiber-reinforced composites produce some of the strongest most versatile most technologically advanced parts ever developed and offer manufacturers designers and engineers a new world of design possibilities.

Wattle and daub is one of the oldest methods of making composite material and dates back more than 6000 years. Concrete is also a composite material used more than any other synthetic material in the world. As of 2006 about 7.5 billion cubic meters of concrete are manufactured each year — more than one cubic meter for every person on Earth. Composite materials can be traced back to earlier times such as straw and mud for brick-making for Egyptian tombs plywood by the Ancient Mesopotamians and cartonnage with layers of linen or papyrus for death masks in Egypt. The first artificial fiber reinforced plastic was a combination of fiberglass and bakelite made in 1935 by the Owens Corning Company.

The uses and benefits of composite materials are seemingly endless — from the development of state-of-the-art prosthetics to supporting renewable energy through better wind turbine design; and even enabling the development of fuel-efficient aircraft drones air taxis and heightened space exploration. It is definitely no surprise why there is an entire week dedicated to this highly beneficial resource. A&P Technology Inc. founded National Composites Week in 2019 to applaud the industry’s innovation economic contributions and proliferation. It is observed in the last week of August annually."

Real Housewives of Beverly Hills fans are still recovering from the four-part season 11 reunion that wrapped up in November 2021 but the ladies are already hard at work on season 12. Filming for the new episodes began in October 2021 and Bravo has since confirmed that the entire season 11 […]

“THIS is a good time.. 💅🏻” the Pretty Mess author 50 captioned a group selfie with Beauvais 55 Crystal Kung-Minkoff Lisa Rinna and Sutton Stracke via Instagram on Sunday January 30 during a group trip to Aspen Colorado.

While the “Roller Coaster” songstress didn’t offer further explanation about the squad’s vacation several of her famous pals gushed over the RHOBH ladies.

“Hey pretties ❤️❤️” Real Housewives of New Jersey’s Melissa Gorga commented on Sunday.

The reality stars who have been in the midst of filming for the upcoming season of the Bravo hit seemingly were involved in some social media tension several days earlier.

Hours later Beauvais acknowledged the social media drama writing “Lol” when a social media user tweeted that she “better eat [Erika’s] ass up.” Eagle-eyed fans also noticed that Stracke 50 had also unfollowed the Georgia native’s account.

Throughout season 11 of RHOBH the ladies had their fair share of dramatic moments amid the Dancing With the Stars alum’s ongoing legal woes.

“How small town of her. The ‘I don’t want to be associated with you because of what the neighbors may think’ [thing] — to me — is cowardice” Erika said about Stracke during an August 2021 episode. “‘I can’t be around you because of my good name.’ It’s like girl come on ‘my reputation’?

With changes in the supply chain mass migrations of employees searching for better wages and packaging and production supply shortages many beloved grocery items are becoming harder to find. And Costco lovers are not exempt.

In fact Costco warehouses across the country are facing many different shortages of our favorite grocery items and we asked our readers on Facebook which ones have been the most frustrating and inconvenient.

Pet supplies

People all over the country are having trouble finding pet food and supplies. A Facebook user in Maui says their Costco location has had a shortage of cat food for quite some time now while another user from Chicago says they've noticed a shortage of canned cat food as well.

People are also noticing shortages of other pet supplies like puppy training pads. And according to our online followers it's not just Costco that's experiencing these shortages as one user says ""there are cat food issues everywhere even delivery services like Chewy are out of stuff.""

Meat

Costco lovers are also noticing a shortage of their favorite meat and animal products. They're having trouble finding bacon pork and fish and one user specifically noticed a shortage of chicken thighs. ""There is always chicken breast but no thighs or drumsticks.""

One Costco shopper also noticed a shortage of the famous Just Bare chicken bites that ""taste like the ones from Chick-fil-A.""

Toilet paper

No one can forget the panic buying of 2020 that left everyone wondering if they were going to be able to find enough toilet paper. With many grocery stores seeing another round of paper product shortages people are wondering if they should be worried.

While there are still some Costco shortages of toilet paper it's nothing compared to the beginning of the pandemic. However changes in the supply chain production and a shortage of employees have forced many stores to limit toilet paper purchases.

Produce

Costco shoppers are also expressing frustration over being able to find their favorite fresh produce. One Facebook user says ""many of the usual fruits were not available in December as well as some of my favorite greens.""

And because of these shortages many customers are noticing a huge spike in produce prices as well.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Employees

Food and paper products aren't the only shortages Costco shoppers are noticing. Across the country Costco warehouses are struggling to keep their employees.

Due to a number of reasons like sickness unfair wages and being overworked more employees are quitting their jobs than we've seen in recent history. And Costco shoppers are starting to take note of how it's affecting them as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy83LXJlYXNvbnMtd2h5LWNvc3Rjby1tZW1iZXJzaGlwLTE3MDAwMzAzOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Reasons Why a Costco Membership Could Save You Big in 2022,"ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com

We know you’ve heard of a Costco card but maybe you’ve passed it up because of the annual membership fee. Gold Star and Business memberships are $60 a year while the Executive Membership is $120 a year. All memberships come with a free Household Card that you can assign to someone else living with you (or working with for a Business Membership) provided they’re over 18.

Though it might seem unreasonable to pay for a membership to a retail store it’s been reported that you can save over $90 each time you go to Costco rather than heading to your local grocery store. This more than makes up for that annual fee. Need some more convincing? Below is a list of reasons why you should join 100 million others and get a Costco membership if you want to save money in 2022.

Buying in Bulk Saves Cash

Costco is known for their jumbo cases of water condiments and pretty much any other household item. Even though it’s initially more expensive than what you’d spend at the grocery store you’re stocking up for months to come. Plus a 10 percent larger package typically saves you 5 percent in cost. The best items to buy in bulk are the Kirkland brand of non-perishable foods meat (you can always freeze it later) paper products soap garbage bags pet food and coffee to name a few.

Price Codes Tell You Where the Deals Are

It’s important to look closely at the prices at Costco particularly the last two digits because then you’ll know when you’re getting the best deal. If you’re looking to buy something that ends in .99 that means it’s a wholesale price. However if it ends in .97 that means that’s the best discount you’ll be able to find so it’s even lower than the original wholesale price. Now you can always feel confident knowing you’re getting the lowest possible price on the items you’re buying.

Another thing that seems to work for the store is its in-house brand Kirkland Signature which gives customers access to high-quality items at reasonable rates.

A few days ago an impressed Redditor posted a picture of a customer service letter from Costco which called the brand ""a real homie"" for reaching out to them with a thoughtful gift card. In the letter Costco noted that their customer recently bought a Dell laptop from the store before adding ""We have since negotiated a better price and are passing the savings to you. Enclosed please find a Costco Shop Card valued at $50.00 per unit purchase.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3Mtd29yc3QtY29zdGNvLWp1aWNlcy1zYXktZGlldGl0aWFucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Worst Juices to Buy at Costco Right Now Say Dietitians,"Not all juices are created equal. In fact a lot of them are made with a ton of added sugar that doesn't come naturally. Costco's juice selection is of course pretty hefty but several of the options are ones you should leave behind on the shelves so as to not have the bulk-sized option in your fridge.

Before we get into what you shouldn't drink here's what you should: 100% juice. Before bringing juice home from Costco (or any grocery store) check out the nutrition label. You're looking for juices that are primarily made with actual produce not sugar or high fructose corn syrup. The added sugar content on the label will also tell you if you're picking up something that's way too loaded with the sweet stuff. If it's labeled 100% juice on the front check the label on the back but most likely this will be your best option!

Now let's get into the ones you want to avoid according to food nutrition experts.

Sunny D

6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Though delicious Sunny D is a sad excuse for orange juice. It's loaded with sugar and may actually make you more thirsty after you drink it.

""Made with 12 grams of added sugars and with high fructose corn syrup as the first ingredient this drink is hardly the same as drinking 100% orange juice which does not contain any added sugar or artificial ingredients"" says Charleston-based registered dietitian Lauren Manaker MS RDN LD.

Instead of this you should reach for pure orange juice so you can get some important vitamins and minerals.

""If you're interested in the vitamin C you can also get that from 100% orange juice like this one"" adds Kacie Barnes MCN RDN of Mama Knows Nutrition.

Pressed 3-Day Cleanse

Juice cleanses like this one can be tempting especially after a holiday or a vacation where you might have eaten or drunk more than you planned. Cleanses however aren't really a good idea though Barnes says and should be avoided.

""You don't need to drink juice to 'cleanse' your body your liver does that"" she says. ""This three-day program will leave you with a headache starving and probably will lead to binging once you finish — if you can make it all the way through. I do not recommend.""

Instead of doing a cleanse focus on eating well-balanced meals throughout the day and drinking plenty of water to jump back into a healthy eating plan.

Kirkland Signature Lemonade

Another delicious juice that'll do nothing for you is Kirkland's lemonade. It makes sense that it would need to be pretty sweet to taste good — it is lemonade after all — but it is very very sweet.

""With 29 grams of added sugars and very little in the nutrition department this lemonade is a sugar bomb that is essentially empty calories"" Manaker says.

You're better off squeezing some fresh lemon into a glass of water for that hint of taste without the added sugar.

V8 Splash

V8's drinks are ones that make you think you're drinking something healthy because it's advertised as having fruits and vegetables in it. And some of them aren't too bad! V8 Splash though is not one of the better options from the collection despite looking like it's chock-full of fruit.

""V8 splash has added high fructose corn syrup you're going to get better nutrition from any of the 100% juice options that Costco sells"" Barnes says.

Kool-Aid Jammers

We love a kids' drink as much as kids do but that doesn't mean it's healthy. Then again you probably already knew Kool-Aid Jammers wasn't a great option because of how sugary they are. You'd be correct in assuming so.

""With the second ingredient being high fructose corn syrup and made with artificial colorings this drink is not equivalent to the nutrition provided by 100% fruit juice — despite it being fruit flavored and colored"" Manaker says.

Though you could drink this juice sparingly as a treat it's not one you should have in regular rotation.

Gatorade

The popular sports drink is probably not something you're going to have with your breakfast but it is still juice.

""It's quite high in added sugar and I only recommend it for endurance athletes"" Barnes says.

It can give you a bit of a boost if you're working out intensely but otherwise sticking with water is a better bet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vNzUxMTA4L2Nvc3Rjby1mYW5zLWNhbnQtd2FpdC10by10cnktdGhpcy1jaG9jb2xhdGUtY292ZXJlZC1jaGVlc2VjYWtlLWhlYXJ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Fans Can't Wait To Try This Chocolate-Covered Cheesecake Heart,"Costco Fans Can't Wait To Try This Chocolate-Covered Cheesecake Heart

Costco is one of those retailers known for putting out extravagant goodies ahead of whatever holiday is up next on the calendar and with Valentine's day approaching we can't help but reminisce over the chocolate peppermint loaves the grocer sold last Christmas. And how could we forget those massive pumpkin pies that show up ahead of Thanksgiving every year?

For the upcoming romantic holiday the store is gearing up with tasty themed items like heart-shaped ravioli and macarons but another favorite is returning this year. ""Just in time for Valentine's Day – the @juniorscheesecake chocolate-covered cheesecake heart has returned to the warehouse!""

The Queen has one of the most envious property portfolios in the world with homes that could make even the world's richest billionaires feel inadequate.

The complete list of her properties if ever put on the market to be sold would be worth eye-watering figures.

However slightly disappointingly for the monarch she doesn't actually own every single one so she may find it difficult to sell some of them if she is ever short of cash.

Sandringham House and the estate is owned outright by the Queen after she inherited the property from her father George VI.

The same can be said for her beloved Balmoral Castle in Scotland or as she is believed to describe it her ""paradise in the highlands"".

Her other official homes are in fact owned by the Crown Estate which owns over 7000 plots in England and Wales.

The Queen's homes that are most recognisable and owned by the Crown are Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle Palace of Holyroodhouse and Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland.

The Crown Estate website explains: ""The Crown Estate belongs to the reigning monarch 'in right of The Crown' that is it is owned by the monarch for the duration of their reign by virtue of their accession to the throne.

""But it is not the private property of the monarch - it cannot be sold by the monarch nor do revenues from it belong to the monarch.""

Essentially the home that the reigning monarch resides in is not as straight forward as it may seem and different Kings and Queens have made different properties their main base.

Interestingly there is one riverside palace in London that was first built over 1000 years ago that the Queen has never stayed in despite some of her ancestors making it their main home.

(Image: Maurice)

Set alongside the River Thames this palace is known throughout the world and even comes with its own alarm clock.

Sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Houses of Parliament or the House of Commons the official name for the building is the Palace of Westminster.

Canute the Great during his reign from 1016 to 1035 was reportedly the first King to use the Westminster area as his centre of power which positioned by the River Thames made logistical and defensive sense.

The oldest part of the palace Westminster Hall which still stands today dates back to King William I who initially lived at the Tower of London but later moved to Westminster.

And during the late middle ages the Palace of Westminster continued to be the primary residence of the Royal Family.

Even Henry VIII made it his home until until a fire destroyed the royal apartments in 1512 and he moved into the newly established Palace of Whitehall.

Of course since then the Palace of Westminster has been rebuilt and refashioned but it is still officially owned by the Crown Estate so will a little persuasion maybe the Queen could ask for it back.

It was created by 3D visual artist Toby Niesser who based the video on an actual physical model of the castle at the Museum of Liverpool along with plans and drawings he found in books.

The castle was probably built in the 1230s to protect King John's new port and was sited at the top of modern-day Lord Street then the highest point in the city.

This corresponds to present day Derby Square and a plaque is fixed to the Victoria monument to mark the spot. The design of the Crown Court building was ""inspired"" by the fact that it is close to the site of the old Castle of Liverpool while the name Castle Street commemorates the building itself.

By the 16th century the castle was said to be in an advanced state of decay and the last remaining ruins were finally removed in 1726.

However some believe remains of the 13th-century stronghold including dungeons are still underneath Derby Square.

An uncompleted replica of the castle was created in Rivington near Chorley in 1912 by soap factory boss William Lever who also founded Port Sunlight.

Toby Niesser 36 said: ""I came across Liverpool Castle by chance without previously knowing that Liverpool actually had a castle. As most people are not aware of the original location of the castle apart from the replica in Rivington I thought it would be good to bring back the castle as accurately as possible for people to see.

""I used the physical castle model in the museum as reference plus some layout/footprint plans of the castle which were available online.

""Despite there being some inaccuracies and flaws it was meant for mainly visual purposes only.

""I was invited by the Museum Of Liverpool to exhibit my reconstruction in Virtual Reality. Both kids and adults enjoyed the experience of being able to walk around the castle and experience the scale of it. It was a pleasurable experience to be able to show off this technology.""

Warrington-based Toby runs his own business specialising in 3D/virtual reality historic reconstructions. It was formerly known as Vivid Virtual Reality but has now rebranded to Experience Digital History.

But Florida-based CSX controls the rail right of way west of Worcester all the way to the Albany station in Rensselaer N.Y. And Amtrak is using some tough regulatory scrutiny of the merger as leverage to ensure it can expand passenger service in the CSX corridor when the time is right.

It’s certainly more likely now thanks to some legal maneuvering amid giant freight railroad operator CSX’s proposed acquisition of the smaller Pan Am Railways a regional freight carrier based in Billerica.

After years of sitting at the platform can a proposal for East-West rail service across Massachusetts finally leave the station?

The US Surface Transportation Board is paying close attention to Amtrak’s needs as it weighs testimony about the merger. Unveiling it in late 2020 CSX promised the merger will improve freight service throughout the Northeast. To back up that assertion last year it delivered a long line of positive letters from government officials freight shippers and chamber of commerce executives. Meanwhile Amtrak and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation tried to hit the brakes citing potential conflicts between freight and passenger use of various CSX and Pan Am lines.

But on the eve of the STB’s two-day hearing earlier this month Amtrak reached a significant breakthrough. CSX agreed to nearly all of Amtrak’s conditions including provisions for more passenger trains west of Worcester. CSX would fully cooperate with any passenger rail proposals along the Albany-Worcester route and help identify improvements to safely increase travel speeds along those tracks.

Getting CSX on board is a crucial step toward ensuring faster more frequent trains. Amtrak currently runs only one train a day between Springfield and Boston the Lake Shore Limited and it features two and a half hours of lollygagging to get from one city to the other.

East-West Rail advocates say they’re encouraged by the CSX-Amtrak agreement. But expensive upgrades are necessary — double-tracking electrification and/or raising the outer rail in certain curvy stretches to effectively bank the turns.

The price tag could total in the billions. Exactly how much depends on whom you ask. Advocacy group TransitMatters began circulating a document last year showing a 90-minute ride between Springfield and Boston could be accomplished within nine years for under $2 billion in upgrades a figure that includes significant work along the commuter rail tracks east of Worcester through Boston’s suburbs. MassDOT’s estimates largely land in the $3 billion to $5 billion range depending on the route and extent of improvements and with somewhat longer travel times.

Good thing for East-West Rail fans that Congress passed that $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Amtrak officials said it contains several funding buckets for intercity rail travel in general and for Amtrak projects specifically. It’s billed as the largest infusion for passenger rail since Amtrak’s creation five decades ago.

East-West advocates also have a powerful ally in Congress: Representative Richie Neal of Springfield chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. Neal talked up the project in December at Springfield’s Union Station where he held a press conference with Labor Secretary Marty Walsh to highlight the infrastructure bill and its potential local impact.

If East-West Rail comes to pass it could end up looking like the Downeaster (Amtrak’s Boston-Maine route) with oversight from a new Western Massachusetts intercity rail authority.

The Baker administration has been a necessary participant in these talks albeit an initially reluctant one. Governor Charlie Baker once vetoed a measure championed by state Senator Eric Lesser to study the viability of East-West Rail back in 2016. Eventually the administration came around and commissioned that report. Now Lesser is pushing legislation requiring MassDOT to run five trains a day between Pittsfield Springfield and Boston. A long-shot bill but it keeps the pressure on.

Lesser who is running for lieutenant governor recognizes COVID-19 dramatically altered commuting patterns but he believes many people will be forced to brave Mass. Pike traffic jams regularly once the pandemic ends. East-West Rail he argues would also attract those in Western Massachusetts who need to go into the office only once or twice a week. For Lesser who hails from Longmeadow this project is about spreading the seemingly unstoppable economic growth in Greater Boston around the other half of the state including by offering more affordable options for young workers who don’t want to pay top-dollar prices to buy a home or rent within striking distance of Route 128.

Is MassDOT ready to hop on board? It’s hard to tell but its lawyers did echo Amtrak’s requests in the CSX-Pan Am merger case by calling for CSX to accommodate multiple round trips on the line between Springfield and Worcester.

First Amtrak officials hope to begin seasonal twice-weekly service from New York City to Pittsfield through the Albany station later this year (the Berkshire Flyer). New Western Massachusetts service to Boston remains several years away. The infrastructure law establishes a Federal Railroad Administration program to identify and prioritize rail corridors where intercity passenger rail service could be launched or expanded. East-West Rail has a big head start in that race for dollars.

In his testimony before the transportation board this month Amtrak executive Dennis Newman said the new CSX agreement sets the stage for Amtrak’s long-held vision to improve passenger service on the entire Albany-Boston corridor. With a rail-friendly Biden administration and billions from the new infrastructure bill Newman said that vision should no longer be considered just a dream anymore.

A: According to “Guide to the Federal Railroad Administration Quiet Zone Rule” distributed by CSX Transportation trains sound their horns to warn motorists and pedestrians that a train is approaching. It is a safety measure to prevent collisions.

Citizens wanting to establish a “quiet zone” (where upgraded warning devices and additional safety measures are installed at grade crossings on a section of rail line) can contact their local public agency to initiate the process. Only a public agency may request a quiet zone.

“A quiet zone is an FRA exemption to the rule requiring trains to sound their horns when approaching public highway-rail grade crossings” according to the guide.

Locomotive engineers have the responsibility and discretion to sound the horn at specified times or when they perceive a safety hazard. The Federal Railroad Administration has specific requirements as to when where how long and how loud a train must sound its horn the guide says.

The train horn rule was created following an increase in train collisions in the late 1980s at certain highway-rail grade crossings where nighttime whistle bans had been established.

In 1994 Congress ordered the FRA to enact federal regulations requiring train horns to be sounded at all public highway-rail grade crossings according to the guide. In 2005 the final rule on quiet zones and the removal of the requirement to sound a horn was adopted and placed in the Code of Federal Regulations.

According to FRA rules cited in the guide train horns must:

be within 96 and 110 decibels a sound level equivalent to that of a lawnmower

be sounded at least 15 seconds but no more than 20 seconds before reaching a crossing

be sounded no more than a quarter of a mile from a crossing if the train is traveling faster than 60 mph

be sounded approaching persons on or near the track

be sounded while moving through tunnels

Train horns may still sound in a quiet zone.

“Quiet zones only prohibit horns to be routinely sounded as a train approaches a grade crossing” according to the guide. “Train crews can still sound horns in emergency situations or for other safety reasons.”

The community requesting the quiet zone “is responsible for funding the installation of additional safety measures which may cost in excess of $200000 per crossing” the guide says.

His latest novel Our Country Friends opens in March 2020 and follows a group of middle-aged friends sheltering from Covid at a country house in upstate New York where the author himself spent the early part of the pandemic. Shteyngart who was born in Leningrad and emigrated to the US in 1979 spoke to me from New York City where he teaches creative writing at Columbia University.



You’ve had to find a new publisher in the UK for this book.

In America it seems to have done very well but my usual British publisher Hamish Hamilton didn’t want it: they said it was too pandemicky. Even my friends were like: “Who’s gonna read this when it’s published? Covid will be a distant memory.” But when I started writing in late March early April 2020 I had a feeling that Covid wouldn’t be over in a year as was predicted. I wrote the novel in six or seven months the fastest I ever wrote. I just think we’re entering a time of permanent crisis. We’re going to be constantly writing about this stuff. Not just pandemic-ravaged New York or whatever; it’s going to be flooded New York flooded London burnt-down Sydney and burnt-down Los Angeles. The pandemic is the amuse-bouche to the endless meal of crap we’re going to be getting without any respite. I’m really not selling this book am I? Now Allen & Unwin’s going to dump me too.



It’s a very funny novel.

I do funny I don’t do not funny but actually to me this is probably the least funny book I’ve ever written. I write about tragic things: the collapse of the Soviet Union now the collapse of America. If you think of an intercontinental ballistic missile like the sort we and Russia may soon launch at each other the missile is the humour but the nuclear payload is the tragedy right? The humour’s just a way to get that payload across to a reader who doesn’t want to sit down with 330 pages of tragedy. But by the end of my books there usually is some kind of tragedy as there is in this one. The humour is my way of saying: “Just come along for the ride I’m not gonna hurt you…” Then blam!

This is probably the least funny book I have ever written



You say you wrote fast but it’s less hectic than your other novels.

This was the sloooowest period of our lives especially around the pandemic’s first iteration as they’d call it in Silicon Valley. Things were super super slow. There was so much time and endless silence that I could almost hear the turtles crossing the road scraping across the gravel. But if you were a writer in a safe place it was also an opportunity to slow the pace of your thinking the pace of your sentences and paragraphs which for this book was very helpful. And here’s the other thing: I was able to be more functional because there weren’t these evenings with other writers where you consume five drinks at a clip and then wake up in the morning you know urgh now I’ve gotta write my three pages. I was like I’m gonna write six pages I’m completely sober! So that was really super-helpful to the process.



The pandemic prompts the novel’s migrant cast to reflect on what their adopted country has become.

A lot of the characters are Asian-American and one of their concerns – which is a concern of people in America and maybe in the UK as well – is that their parents gave up their culture and moved here because they thought they might find a sense of safety. Some of that safety feels very much like a mirage now. My wife is Korean-American and we’re having this conversation about you know if Trump wins in 2024 where do we go? She says maybe we can move to Seoul – she can probably reclaim her citizenship – and our son is already taking Korean lessons. You know our parents brought us here because they wanted us to have a better chance and now we’re thinking of where to escape. The rightwing establishments talking about “China flu” and “the China virus” aren’t gonna tell that my wife’s Korean not Chinese it’s all the same to them. The book reflects that danger we felt; it’s funny yeah but under the surface are real fears.



What were you reading while you wrote?

I reread all my Chekhov not just the plays but the short stories in Russian and in English. There’s a very good new translation Fifty-Two Stories by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. I had a great time rereading him because in all Chekhov’s books people are in the countryside turning a certain age talking about their regrets which was perfect for this novel. I also watched the Japanese reality show Terrace House which is highly recommended. Everyone just sits around makes soba noodles and has these low-stakes conversations that actually aren’t really low stakes. There’s 500 episodes and we’d watch three or four a night.



What books do you assign your writing students?

I’m about to start teaching a course about comic fiction so I’ve been rereading a lot of very contemporary humorous fiction. Andrew Sean Greer’s Less is in there so is Raven Leilani and Fleishman Is in Trouble. Going back further we have Nabokov Philip Roth and Zadie Smith’s White Teeth which is a very funny novel still and holds up well I think. I started writing around the same time as Zadie and we’ve known each other since about that time. It’s interesting to read it now because that book so much ushered in the idea of multicultural fiction at least in the UK. There’s almost a kind of optimism about this new kind of society being born and now it’s like oh shit it didn’t work out the way we expected it to work out.

Mitchell Starc Wanted To Quit Test Cricket; Shane Warne’s Criticism Didn’t Help

The 31-year-old Starc also became just the fifth pace bowler in 22 years to win the Medal to join the likes of Test skipper Pat Cummins Mitchell Johnson Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath as the only fast bowlers to win the top award since it was introduced in 2000.

Mitchell Starc Wanted To Quit Test Cricket; Shane Warne's Criticism Didn't Help

Sydney: Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc has said that he had reached a point in his career last year when he didn’t really want to play Test cricket. Starc also made it apparent that the criticism from former spin wizard Shane Warne ahead of the Ashes had not gone down well with him.

On Saturday Starc whose all-round performance during the recently concluded Ashes was the key to the hosts winning the series 4-0 received the highest individual award in Australian men’s cricket — the Allan Border Medal — based on his performance in the last 12 months.

The 31-year-old Starc also became just the fifth pace bowler in 22 years to win the Medal to join the likes of Test skipper Pat Cummins Mitchell Johnson Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath as the only fast bowlers to win the top award since it was introduced in 2000.

But Starc said there was a point in his career where he simply had no zeal left to continue playing Test cricket.

“Obviously last year was particularly tough on and off the field” Starc was quoted as saying by foxsports.com.au after being handed the AB Medal on Saturday. “I probably didn’t play the cricket I wanted to and at certain stages I probably didn’t want to play cricket at all.”

The pacer was heavily scrutinised after his below-par performance in the 2020/21 series against India where he took just 11 wickets at 40.72. On a personal front his father passed away after battling cancer weeks after the India series.

To make matters worse his performance in the ICC T20 World Cup in Dubai too left a lot to be desired with the pacer conceding 60 runs without taking a wicket in his four overs in the final. Criticism started mounting ahead of the Ashes with Warne suggesting that Jhye Richardson should play the first Test at Brisbane.

“I think what was it? It was a straight half-volley on leg stump I think someone (Warne) said” said Starc on the criticism from the legendary spinner.

“What would you like me to speak to him (Warne) about? It doesn’t interest me at all. He’s (Warne) entitled to his opinion. I’m just going to go about my cricket the way I’d like to and I’ve got my family support networks and I get to play cricket with some of my best mates so I’m pretty comfortable with where I’m at” said Starc.

Starc played all five Ashes games coming up with one of his best Test series with 19 wickets at an average of 25.37.

Starc said that it’s the opinion of his wife and Australia wicket-keeper Alyssa Healy that matters the most to him adding that blocking the voices of others had helped him keep a cool head in the last two years.

“I made it a key point of mine to not pay too much attention to I guess opinions outside of my circle of trust if you like which I did a few years ago. And I think that’s kept me in a pretty level space through the last few years with either not playing the cricket I wanted to or certainly challenges off the field. I’ve got a wife who plays at the highest level and a couple of my closest mates who play international cricket so I’ve got a pretty good sounding board in that regard.”

Here’s how you can get them.

Locate your nearest pharmacy

The CDC has a list of participating pharmacies in the Federal Pharmacy Retail Program initially set up for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines that will be giving out masks.

Follow the posted signs inside the store

CVS Health told Today in a statement that there will be signs “posted to indicate N95 mask availability” within its stores.

From there you will be able to pick up a maximum of three masks per individual while supplies last.

Can you get more than 3 masks?

As of now there are only three free N95 masks being distributed per person.

If you want more than three you’ll need to buy them. Several merchants specialize in NIOSH-certified N95 mask sales as well as KN95 masks and KF94 masks with reasonably fast shipping.

Here are just a few places:

(Note: Amazon does have N95 KN95 and KF94 masks for sale but be careful about buying counterfeit ones if you choose to shop there.)

WATCH: Is this who the Boston Celtics are? A mediocre team on the treadmill of mediocrity?

The Boston Celtics took their last two games before they went on the road to face the Atlanta Hawks to heart smashing both the Washington Wizards and Sacramento Kings to pieces at TD Garden in convincing fashion in what was up that point their most complete games of the season.

In what should have been an ideal opportunity to show the lessons they had learned about how to play the game consistently regardless of the opponent in front of them or the arena dome over their heads the Celtics instead fell on their faces and fell back into old habits to hand the game on a platter to the Hawks.

What is going on with this team? Is it cursed to hover at .500 on the dreaded treadmill of mediocrity forever? Is there something internal that can be done to improve things? Or do there need to be minor medium or even major moves made to right the ship that is this Celtics roster?

The hosts of the CLNS Media podcast “The Garden Report” debate where the team is at and what it needs to do to get better in their most recent episode. Watch the clip embedded above to hear what they believe the team ought to do next.

One of those was guard Kevin Zeitler who had a phenomenal year for Baltimore as he helped solidify the right side of the offensive line.

When looking at the best and worst free agent signings of the 2021 offseason Sam Monson of Pro Football Focus named Zeitler among the best. Monson looked at some of Zeitler’s statistics over the course of the year which show that he was a dominant force on the interior for the Ravens.

“Zeitler had been one of the better guards in the league for the Bengals and Cleveland Browns before a stint in New York caused him hit free agency after the worst season of his career. The Ravens relied on the experience of facing him for years within the AFC North and signed him to a three-year contract where he bounced back immediately to something akin to his career baseline. Zeitler finished the season with a 76.4 PFF grade — more than 10 grading points higher than his last year in New York. He allowed one sack and 17 pressures all season and was a significant upgrade on a line that was trending in the wrong direction.”

Zeitler signed a three-year $22.5 million deal with Baltimore in March and was a tremendous bargain for what they were able to get from him on the field. He and center Bradley Bozeman made a great one-two punch as they both were arguably deserving of Pro Bowl nods. Zeitler has two years remaining on his contract and should continue his high level of play into the 2022 season."

The machine uses John Deere’s 8R tractor with a TruSet enabled chisel plough GPS guidance system and new advanced technologies.

The goal said John Deere was to provide technology that can help farmers feed a global population that is expected to grow to 10bn by 2050. With less land available to grow this food coupled with a shrinking skilled labour pool and growing issues created by climate change autonomous technology will play a key role in driving agriculture efficiency forward.

Diving into the technology on the new auto John Deere 8R the tractor has six pairs of stereo cameras which enables 360° obstacle detection and the calculation of distance. Images captured by the cameras are passed through a deep neural network that classifies each pixel in approximately 100 milliseconds and determines if the machine continues to move or stops depending on if an obstacle is detected.

The autonomous tractor is also continuously checking its position relative to a geofence ensuring it is operating where it is supposed to and is accurate to within less than one inch. All a farmer has to do to use the new tractor is drive it to the field and configure it for autonomous operation.

Using John Deere Operations Centre Mobile they can swipe from left to right to start the machine. While the machine is working the farmer can leave the field to focus on other tasks while monitoring the machine’s status from their mobile device.

This mobile technology from John Deere provides access to live video images data and metrics and allows a farmer to adjust speed depth and more. In the event of any job-quality anomalies or machine-health issues farmers will be notified remotely and can make adjustments to optimise the performance of the machine.

Jahmy Hindman chief technology officer at John Deere said: “You fast forward a century from those first tractors and you'll find some of the most advanced robotic machines are being used on the farm to feed the world. If you visit a farm you'll see as much technology in the field as you will in Silicon Valley.

“This precise location-sensing technology enables farmers to place seeds spread nutrients and harvest their crops without having to touch the steering wheel. Without this self-driving technology farming is incredibly exhausting mentally and physically. GPS technology allows farmers to spend their time in the cab of a tractor looking at the real-time data they are collecting during the job they are doing and making adjustments.

“The world's population is expected to grow from about 8bn to nearly 10bn people by 2050 increasing the global food demand by 50%. Farmers must feed this growing world population and it's our job at John Deere to help them. The future of agriculture starts now” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuYmF5cHJlc3NnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3dpczM0OTAxMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wilmine Burmeister Obituary,"Wilmine Burmeister

Pulaski - Wilmine Louise (Willie) Burmeister 92 passed away January 26 2022. Born June 10 1929 in Kent City MI she is the daughter of the late F. George Baehre and Louise (Reister) Baehre. Willie grew up on a fruit farm near Sparta MI. She attended Trinity Lutheran School and graduated from Sparta High School in 1947. Involved in 4H during her formative years Willie learned how to garden can cook bake and sew. These interests led her to study Home Economics at Michigan State University in East Lansing MI. Willie's plans took a different course after meeting veterinary student William (Bill) Burmeister. They fell in love got engaged and Willie decided it was time to change her course of study. She began taking courses in bookkeeping. She did clerical and secretarial work in the 4H Department at MSU.

On June 9 1951 Wilmine and William were married. They had four children: William Frederick Burmeister Jane Kay (Jeffrey) Raday Nancy Lynn (Randall) Lewis and James Paul (Kimberley) Burmeister.

Upon Bill's graduation from veterinary school Willie and Bill settled in Pulaski WI and set up a veterinary practice. Willie helped Bill with secretarial and bookwork for a number of years in the practice. Her bookkeeping skills from college were instrumental in helping with the veterinary business.

Willie had a wide range of interests. First and foremost she was a homemaker. This included caring for and nurturing her four children. Willie loved to mow the lawn in summer and blow the snow in winter. You would often see her on ""The Big John Deere"". She used the talents learned in her youth to preserve many fruits and vegetables from her prize-winning garden. She could make some mean berry and pecan pies! It was ""all about the crust"" she'd say. Not to mention bars and tortes hand baked to take to church functions. Willie was a talented seamstress. Most people did not realize this but she made curtains clothes and hemmed many a pair of pants. Willie was an avid bowler in the earlier days as well as a bridge card player with women from the community known as ""The Bridge Club"".

Willie and Bill were charter members of St. John Lutheran Church in Pulaski. Willie was an active member in Worship Bible Study Choir Lutheran Woman's Missionary League and Ladies Guild. She loved to cook bake and plan for many a fellowship and funeral at St. John's. Willie was known for her ""killer dill pickles"". Many a time these pickles went to the highest bidder during silent auctions at church.

Besides her dedication as a homemaker Willie loved the Packers and the Brewers. She and Bill were Packer season ticket holders and attended the 1967 ""Ice Bowl"" championship game at old Lambeau Field. Willie often bundled up in her 1960s mouton fur coat to be fashionable and warm for the games. Their ties to the Packers date back to the original City Stadium. Willie's love of sports would find her in the stands of many a little league game and Pulaski Red Raider football baseball and basketball games watching her children play cheer and participate in Red Raider Marching Band. A special highlight for Willie was meeting some of the Lombardi-era Packer greats and traveling to Los Angeles to watch son Bill compete in the National Punt Pass and Kick Competition in 1964. A proud moment for her.

She is survived by her children 10 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren; her younger sister Kathryn (Charles) Buchtrup Crossville TN; and a sister-in-law Kathleen Baehre Grand Rapids MI.

Willie was preceded in death by husband Bill in 2021 just a few weeks after they celebrated their 70th anniversary together; her daughter-in-law Sherry Burmeister; a great-grandson Simeon Burmeister; her sister Charlotte Bradford; a brother Frederick Baehre.

Friends are invited to gather with the family at St. John Lutheran Church 910 S. St. Augustine Street Pulaski WI 54162 on Thursday February 3 from 4-7 p.m. Visitation will continue on Friday at the church from 9-11 a.m. The funeral service will be at 11 a.m. with Pastor Larry R. Yaw officiating. The funeral service will be livestreamed and can be found at stjohnpulaskiwi.org. She will be laid to rest at Nicolet Memorial Mausoleum in Green Bay WI.

In lieu of flowers the family has asked that memorial gifts be made to St. John Lutheran Church in Pulaski.

Willie's family would like to thank the dedicated staff at Woodside Nursing Home for the wonderful care given to her.

Willie lived her life a faithful servant of God and is at peace with her Lord in Heaven. She has certainly earned her crown! ""Be thou faithful unto death and I will give you a crown of life."" Revelations 2:10.

Groups of giddy teen girls. Kiddos under 10 with their parents. Tweens with masks on their chins.

At fast-rising country star Walker Hayes' concert in St. Paul there were more kids percentage-wise than at a typical country show. Kids haven't dominated a country crowd like this since maybe when Hunter Hayes (no relation) emerged a decade ago at age 20.

Walker Hayes appeals to youngsters for several reasons:

* He's massively popular on TikTok.

* He involves his own kids in his TikTok videos.

* His country songs rely on sing-songy hip-hop vocal cadence that borders on nursery rhymey making them easy to sing along with and dance to.

At 42 Hayes is fast becoming Nashville's most beloved dad since Garth Brooks took a hiatus from the road to raise his third daughters.

A father of six Hayes trotted out his oldest daughter Lela to dance during ""DeLorean"" a new song from his week-old third album. Meanwhile his other children stood in the wings with Mom Laney dancing out of the spotlight.

Hayes showcased eight selections from the new ""Country Stuff: The Album."" And many of the 2000-plus fans sang along to the fresh tunes.

Even though he grew up in the suburbs of Mobile Ala. and not on a farm Hayes celebrates country sensibilities in his songs name-checking John Deere Nick Saban and Hank Williams Sr. and Jr. But Hayes is suburban enough to mention a Honda Accord the hip-hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and R. Kelly's hit ""Ignition."" And before the ""Fancy Like"" hitmaker took the stage the PA broadcast ""Fancy"" by Iggy Azalea and ""Fancy"" by Drake and as well as ""Fancy"" by country queen Reba McEntire.

Hayes got the crowd dancing to the bumpin' ""Black Sheep"" and the new ""U Girl"" during which his bass player switched to keyboards for a heavier bass sound.

Before Hayes delivered his current single the twangy sing-along ""AA"" he said he hopes it will become his equivalent of ""Friends in Low Places"" the Garth classic. Judging by the crowd's raucous reaction on Saturday Hayes' dream just might come true.

The versatile singer manifested his love for R&B with ""Break the Internet"" featuring his falsetto. He showed his love for his family on the solo acoustic ""Lela's Stars"" and during his meg-hit ""Fancy Like"" when four of his kids — and his wife — joined him to dance in unison.

Coming across as genuinely humble and grateful during only his third concert on this tour (plus he entertained at halftime of Sunday's AFC championship NFL game in Kansas City) Hayes in a pinch-myself-I-can't-believe-it moment encored with a solo acoustic reading of ""Fancy Like"" at the end of his 90-minute performance.

Screnshot by ZDNet

The departure of Omicron and the arrival of business travel seem inevitably linked.

Airlines are craving the day when higher-paying price-elastic business customers will adorn their planes again.

I wonder though whether airlines are truly prepared for that day.

Delta Air Lines which many believe is America's finest offered another recent prediction about business flyers' return.

The airline's president Glen Hauenstein recently mused that spring and summer would see a strong resurgence of business travel. Yes this spring and summer.

In what feels like a related edict Hauenstein suggested that the airline wasn't afraid of lower-cost carriers. Instead he said Delta's superior offering was geared to a more premium customer.

People are prepared to pay more for better. Business travelers are certainly prepared to pay more for better. And in times gone by Delta has proved this.

Now the airline is making sure there aren't too many seats on its planes. It's trying to enhance legroom. It's even offering an enhanced premium economy offering to attract business travelers who may not be adorned with the most glorious travel budgets.

This all appears both wise and daring.

How much though might this drive to an exalted plane entail getting its customer service technology in order?

I only ask because of the recent experience of a Delta passenger David Slotnick of the Points Guy.

He tweeted this lament: ""Is there anything more frustrating than an airline website returning an error and telling you to call and the phone line telling you they're too busy try using the website?""

You see the Delta website had offered him this: ""Oh no! We're sorry David but there was a problem processing your request. Please try the entry again. If you continued to experience problems please call the SkyMiles Platinum Medallion line at 800-325-1551.""

Should you not be a regular flyer the Platinum Medallion thing blesses precisely the elevated flyers for which Delta yearns.

Delta isn't alone of course in having such issues.

Why in the comments to Slotnick's lament travel writer Joe Brancatelli targeted American Airlines: ""More annoying than all of that: the Verifly app which you must use to fly AA intl. It tries to upsell a faster 'review' of your negative Covid test. It's despicable that you have to use a middleman to deal with your own airline -- and have the middleman try to upsell services.""

Premium passengers require premium comfort which includes premium technology to help them on their way.

Last year Delta installed a new phone system specifically for fancy passengers. It didn't receive universal approval as customers felt it didn't understand what they were talking about.

Things haven't improved too much it seems.

The impression left is that there's yet no substitute for having a sufficient number of human beings on call to deal with the problems of a plethora of human beings.

Another impression left of course is that existing technologies can't cope with the current vicissitudes of flying.

Or perhaps that they're not very good at it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbHlmdC1kZWx0YS11cGRhdGUtYXBwLWZsaWdodC1zdGF0dXNlcy10cmF2ZWwtaW5mb9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbHlmdC1kZWx0YS11cGRhdGUtYXBwLWZsaWdodC1zdGF0dXNlcy10cmF2ZWwtaW5mby5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lyft Delta update app partnership to show flight statuses and air travel info,"Lyft and Delta Air Lines are making rides to the airport less stressful with in-app flight status updates that’ll be delivered to customers who have linked Delta SkyMiles accounts.

A spokesperson for Lyft told FOX Business the ride-share app is now capable of displaying a user’s upcoming flight number intended destination boarding and departure time terminal number and gate number.

UBER LYFT DRIVERS WANT MORE PROTECTION AS RISING CRIME KEEPS MANY OFF THE ROADS

These accessible reminders will be shown to Delta SkyMiles customers in a ""Your upcoming Delta flight"" window near the bottom of active Lyft ride details and are designed to keep Delta passengers informed about their flights while they’re en route to the airport.

Lyft’s update comes a month after the ride-share company announced it would add this airline-specific feature to its app.

DELTA EXTENDS LIFE OF EXPIRING TRAVEL VOUCHERS FROM PANDEMIC

""Travelers are keen to get to their destinations as planned and these new in-app features we’re implementing through our expanded partnership with Delta will help make the journey even better"" Lyft's Zach Greenberger said in a company press release from December 2021.

""Delta and Lyft share a commitment to making the hospitality experience the priority and our partnership is making the day-of travel experience even smoother for travelers.""

OVER 200 UNRULY AIRLINE PASSENGERS REPORTED JANUARY STILL FAR BELOW A YEAR AGO

The new feature is available only in the U.S. Delta Air Lines is the only airline partner Lyft has.

Lyft and Delta Air Lines first partnered in February 2018. Since then the two companies have offered mile rewards for customers who have linked their Lyft and Delta SkyMiles accounts.

The airlines is adding ‘artisan-made amenity kits recycled bedding reusable and biodegradable service ware and premium canned wine’.

Delta says the new products will collectively reduce onboard single-use plastic consumption by approximately 4.9 million pounds per year –the weight of 1500 standard-sized cars – as well as “significantly increasing Delta’s support of minority- and women-run businesses”.

Among the changes are two new aluminium-canned wines from Imagery Estate Winery a Sonoma winery led by award-winning winemaker Jamie Benziger. In 2019 Jamie was named Best Winemaker at the International Women’s Wine Competition and named to Wine Enthusiast’s 40 Under 40 list.

Delta will offer Imagery’s Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay onboard starting with select domestic flights in January expanding to all U.S. domestic flights later this year. The wine’s aluminium packaging reduces annual plastic use by up to 250000 pounds. Imagery’s wines are also sustainably grown as certified by the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aW50ZXItb2x5bXBpY3MtYmVpamluZy1kZWx0YS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winter Olympics: Team USA Flies Delta Airbus A350 To Beijing,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aW50ZXItb2x5bXBpY3MtYmVpamluZy1kZWx0YS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjkvdS1zLWFpcmxpbmVzLWNhbmNlbGxlZC01MDAwLWZsaWdodHMtYWhlYWQtb2Ytc25vd3N0b3JtL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjkvdS1zLWFpcmxpbmVzLWNhbmNlbGxlZC01MDAwLWZsaWdodHMtYWhlYWQtb2Ytc25vd3N0b3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Airlines Cancelled 5000 Flights Ahead of Snowstorm,"It will take days for U.S. airlines to get their schedules back on track after a Nor'easter bore down on the East Coast.

U.S. carriers on Friday canceled thousands of flights through the weekend in anticipation of a winter storm forecast to bring high winds and heavy snow across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.

The National Weather Service said in an advisory that the Nor’easter would result in dangerous blizzards and make travel “nearly impossible.” Flight-tracking service FlightAware reported about 4900 U.S. flights were canceled between Friday and Sunday.

Delta Air Lines said it would suspend operations at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports in New York Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey and Logan airport in Boston from Saturday through Sunday morning.

The Atlanta-based carrier canceled 1290 flights from Friday to Sunday. Customers who would have traveled then were allowed to reschedule to different flights without extra cost.

“Delta teams are focused on a safe and orderly restart of operations at these airports and others in the Northeast Sunday afternoon depending on conditions” the company said in a statement.

Similarly American Airlines canceled about 1160 flights as it expects “significant” impact from the storm on its Northeast operations especially at Logan airport. Affected passengers can rebook flights without change fees.

New York-based JetBlue canceled about 500 flights through Sunday including half of its scheduled flights on Saturday.

United Airlines has cut 21% of its Saturday flights according to FlightAware.

The storm has added to the challenges facing the airline industry which is trying to recover from turbulence caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant. An increase in COVID-19 infections among employees has left carriers short staffed forcing them to cancel flights.

Southwest Airlines Co on Thursday said about 5000 employees or roughly 10% of its workforce had contracted the virus in the first three weeks of January. The company has canceled more than 5600 flights thus far this month which is estimated to cost it $50 million in revenue.

The ""Can't Fight the Moonlight"" singer took a trip to Gruene Hall in Texas. As the oldest dance hall in the state performances in the 19th-century building automatically feel a bit more intimate than your typical concert venue. As a Grammy-winning singer fans don't think twice when they see LeAnn sell out shows. However we're doing double takes after seeing her stunning outfit. Just take a look for yourself:

The caption reads ""Getting ready to walk in to another SOLD OUT weekend at @gruenehall next month. I’m so excited to be back at one of my favorite venues!""

The singer is definitely giving America's Next Top Model a run for their money. In true Texas fashion LeAnn struts her stuff in a black cowboy hat to match her strappy top that shows off her entire back. It's like a mullet — business in the front and a party in the back. She keeps things simple and sleek as she finishes the outfit with black heels.

In THAT outfit you can bet your bottom dollar fans ran to the comments to share their thoughts. Along with a flurry of fire emojis people left sweet messages for the singer like ""Queen 🔥"" ""You are stunning🔥👏"" and ""Ooookkaayyyyy i hate to see you go buttttt i love to watch ya leave 😍.""

This isn't LeAnn's first rodeo when it comes to making jaws drop to the floor. Exhibit A? Her stunning black dress that she rocked in a previous New Years post has us dreaming of the day we have an excuse to wear a floor length gown. Exhibit B? LeAnn took to Instagram to share her aspirations for 2022 in a blush nightgown and it made us second guess our choice of flannel pajamas. Maybe looking nice even when lounging around is the way to go!

Now we're left wondering ""Ok but how does LeAnn always look so fit?"" In an interview with Us Weekly the singer shared that she likes to eat healthy and workout at least four times a week. She also isn't shy to treat herself every now and then. “Sometimes nourishment is the cake the chips the pizza and the mac and cheese"" she said. It's all about balance.

With an upcoming sold out show new album and many memorable outfits to come we can't wait to see what LeAnn has in store for the rest of the year.

Let us admit that we all are curious about the metaverse and the future it is offering to pursue all the buzz created since Mark Zuckerberg announced it in October 2021.

But have you thought about how distinct aspects of metaverse penetrates the field of architecture and design? This article intends to answer this question.

First things first what is metaverse?

Metaverse is an online virtual world that incorporates augmented reality virtual reality 3D holographic avatars video and other forms of communication. Users in the metaverse “live” in a digital realm engaging with one another using avatars and virtual reality technologies. This technology enables people to live parallel lives by adopting unique digitalized avatars.

Indeed the concept of the metaverse is conceived long back. The idea was first coined in 1992 by an American author called Neal Stephenson in his science fiction novel called “Snow Crash.” It represented a concept of a digital world emerging shortly. Currently Stephenson is working for Magic Leap to help build the metaverse.

Metaverse concept was initially manifested in “Second Life” and “Roblox.”

Second Life is a game where participants are given a second life in a virtual environment. Users could explore spectacular landscapes build their castles forests and spaceships create their avatar meet new people shop and participate in social activities. It was launched in 2003 and failed later due to hardware requirements a lack of an intuitive interface and other factors. However Philip Rosedale the founder of Linden Lab’s virtual online world Second Life will return to the project as a strategic adviser to help it navigate its metaverse launch.

Roblox is a bizarre game set in an open universe that contains thousands of games. Since its inception in 2004 the platform has included 47 million daily active users and 9.5 million developers who produce “experiences” or user-created environments and games and generate money in this industry.

Facebook:

Mark Zuckerberg the co-founder of the social media website Facebook and its parent company Meta (formerly Facebook Inc.) revealed the metaverse as the next step in the growth of social networking that aims to assist people in connecting forming communities and expanding their enterprises. It enables users to enjoy immersive experiences within a virtual environment where individuals can do anything they want including work play and socialize. He updated his company’s name to “Meta” to reflect this new realm of his brand. Zuckerberg marks metaverse as the beginning of a new era and he predicts that the metaverse will reach 1 billion individuals in the next ten years.

This new world is not coming all at once and architects as we know them today are not going anywhere for quite some time.

Metaverse architects:

It cannot be denied that architects contribute significantly to the fulfillment of imaginative projects in the metaverse. People require places in the metaverse; hence architects and designers are needed to create or enhance these spaces. However who we consider as architects will probably change with expanding this new world. Thanks to the shift in the goal of architecture a possibility is that we will see a distinction between the title of an architect and a meta architect over the years. While traditional architecture plays a critical role in providing shelter and facilitating our day-to-day activities meta architects will be working purely on the form geometry and visuals.

Architects building for the metaverse may require new skills and a shift in perspective. In metaverse architects need to do the 3dmodeling and integrate professional knowledge in multiple fields including user interface content design character design and even game design. And this will open up the world of architecture to so many people. A more comprehensive range of game designers and programmers may become architectural design teams. More people will participate in the process of this new-age architectural design.

Apart from this architectural education will need to teach a combination of digital media and 3d technology to this new age of architects. This leads to a shift beyond the history of architecture construction techniques and materials.

The virtual metaverse environment would be utilized to improve the relationship between architecture students and their professors and instructors by a fully immersive environment without requiring physical presence. A practical framework to create interactive relationships will be presented that can be used by any school of architecture.

Furthermore metaverse might also be a new frontier in architectural conservation. Since several buildings have collapsed by natural or man-made calamities metaverse can be the platform where we preserve buildings inside this digital reality for the sake of future generations. It can be considered a way to express and explore the architectural heritage that allows users online to have an immersive interaction with the environment and each other.

Metaverse vs. actual architecture:

There are differences between a metaverse and authentic architecture. The most significant difference is the characteristics of the space itself. Whether you interact with a space or not it exists in a natural environment. However each place has a reason or a story in a virtual environment. That reason serves as the fundamental elements of the virtual environment.

In addition no real-life rules or restrictions such as gravity structural stability climatic issues or physical laws will be at play in the metaverse. Therefore architects have the freedom to overcome the existing conditions and create exceptional environments and authentic pieces of art.

On the other hand not all five senses are included in the metaverse architecture. Thus the atmosphere is delivered with limited sources and visual and audio effects are more emphasized.

Finally while in existing architecture visualizations are created to deliver the atmosphere and details of the space to the audience before the construction in the metaverse the whole environment is built with the same volume of time and effort spent only for visualization.

Pros and Cons of Metaverse for architecture:

Courtesy of Plethora-project

Metaverse is regarded as both beneficial and detrimental for architects. For instance a digital twin of an actual project can be created in the virtual environment of the metaverse in which clients have the authority to live there for a month to see if they enjoy the space before building it.

Another benefit of this new realm for architecture would be the capacity it gives to people of all ages to make a name in the architecture industry. Comparing it to the most famous architects of the natural world who are pretty old because it takes years to build projects is a real benefit.

However as metaverse architects working in front of computer screens for long hours it can be harmful to our circadian rhythm in the long term.

New business opportunities

The world around us is changing and all of this has been accelerated with the popularity of NFTs. Companies are creating digital assets with significant values since they are scarce just as regular assets in life. Platforms like Somnium Space and Decentraland have already started selling virtual parcels of land that people can own and build upon resulting in a surge in the digital real estate field. Demand in meta-architectural firms has recently surpassed supply providing new opportunities for architects to participate and design in this new digital world.

Decentraland Architects is a blockchain virtual world founded in March 2021. They provide 3d design and architecture for customers to build and develop professional virtual real estate. Users can use the in-game cryptocurrency Mana to buy parcels and plots of land and spend their time in an immersive environment.

Taking all the points into consideration how we imagine our future home metaverse depends mostly on how well the spaces are designed. Therefore It looks like architects are going to be at the forefront of the metaverse by providing highly desirable space qualities for millions of users.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcHJldmlldy5jby51ay9pbmRleC5waHAvMjAyMi8wMS90aGUtaGlkZGVuLWZydXN0cmF0aW9uLWFuZC1pbXBhY3Qtb2YtdWstZGF0YS1jZW50cmUtY2xvc3VyZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Hidden Frustration and Impact of UK Data Centre Closures,"Saturday Jan 29th 2022 (12:01 am) - Score 6456

At the end of last year Equinix suddenly informed clients of their MA2 IBX data centre in Manchester that they intended to close the facility. Such moves typically create an unwanted extra expense for UK broadband ISPs and full fibre (FTTP) builders among others. Not that consumers would notice.

The closure of a data centre which often comes as a shock to customers can create a “major surprise expense” for those affected as one disgruntled client of the aforementioned centre told us because they end up having to rebuild into a different building (exceptions may exist for managed clients). In the case of MA2 Equinix already has several alternative centres in Manchester (e.g. MA1 MA3 and MA4).

NOTE: Equinix also has various data centres in London (e.g. LD3 LD5 LD6 LD8 LD9 plus new ones at LD4 LD7 LD10).

Closures like the one mentioned above don’t usually occur due to a lack of demand either and if anything there seem to be far more centres currently being built than shut. For example Equinix only recently announced plans to build a new £61m International Business Exchange (IBX) data centre in the Agecroft Commerce Park in Salford which is to be called MA5 (due to be completed in Q2 2022).

All of this begs the question why close such centres in the first place? According to the letter that Equinix sent to its clients the company has been evaluating their “real estate portfolio“ which includes “determining which assets are strategic to our business … and the cost/benefit analysis of continuing to operate specific sites.” Apparently MA2 “no longer meets our criteria for continued operation.”

The same letter notes that Equinix’s lease on MA2 is due to expire soon and they will stop operating it from 30th June 2023.

A Spokesperson for Equinix told ISPreview.co.uk: “As stewards of some of the most important digital infrastructure in the world we regularly review our IBX data centre footprint to ensure it is aligned with both our customers’ needs to interconnect with vibrant digital ecosystems as well as our long-term strategic business goals including striving for sustainability excellence. We believe highly scalable and resilient campus environments are the best way to curate these digital ecosystems and when appropriate we make the decision to close legacy sites and work with customers to migrate their operations to optimal locations. After a thorough evaluation it has been determined that the expiration of the lease on MA2 in 2022 provides an opportunity to close the site and that it is in the best interest of customers located at MA2 to migrate to an alternative IBX data centre facility where they will gain access to a wider selection of interconnectivity options business partners and best-in-class IBX data centre facilities and services.”

Much as we said earlier Equinix are not the only data centre operator to hit customers with such an announcement. Meridian House in Docklands is another while Telehouse Metro went at the end of 2020. Oracle is also reported to be considering the closure of its Linlithgow data centre in Scotland and all of this is before we consider smaller DCs which are harder to track.

The suspicion from some quarters is that some of these closures particularly when they impact smaller DCs may have been fuelled by demand from more profitable housing developments. But in other cases it could simply reflect a wider transition toward the cloud or the need to scale-up into bigger or more cost-effective premises. The only upside is that most DCs do seem to give plenty of time to adapt (often measured in years).

None of this will cause too much of an impact for the major network operators (e.g. Openreach Virgin Media CityFibre etc.) because many of those have their own DCs (or exchanges) but smaller players can be much more exposed to such changes. Ultimately ISPs and network builders have no choice but to adapt to such closures but thankfully the drama rarely impacts consumers (unless something has gone very.. wrong).",,,

Credit cards are one way for people to boost their credit score with their everyday purchases. However qualifying for a credit card often requires a good credit score so it can be difficult to start building your credit. However fintech companies have been working on innovative solutions to help build your credit score outside of traditional methods. Extra Card has created a debit card that allows people build credit without a credit check or a high credit score to qualify. Below Select looks at how Extra Card works and the different features it offers.

How can Extra be a debit card that improves your credit score?

Extra was founded by Max Hellerstein Cyrus Summerlin and Biren Shah in 2020. Extra works kind of like a charge card. With a charge card cardholders are unable to carry a balance from month-to-month and are required to pay their balances off in full after an interval of time usually every 30 days. With Extra cardholders make a purchase and Extra pays off the merchant at the time of transaction. However Extra connects to your checking account so one day after you make a purchase Extra takes the money from your bank account for that transaction. At the end of the month Extra then reports your card transactions to the credit bureaus Equifax and Experian. Extra does not currently report to Transunion. Extra is in communication with Transunion about its information being added to Transunion's credit reporting says Max Hellerstein Co-Founder and CEO of Extra Card. By reporting cardholder's payments to Equifax and Experian the Extra Card can have a positive impact on your credit score as reported by those two bureaus.

Extra Card (Rewards + Credit Building) Rewards Up to 1% rewards points on all purchases

Welcome bonus None

Annual fee $25 a month or $199 upfront for the year.

Foreign transaction fee N/A — cannot be used internationally

Credit needed None Pros Does not require a security deposit like other credit cards for building credit

No credit check or minimum credit score required Cons Costs $199 annually

Only reports to two credit bureaus Equifax and Experian View More

Using an Extra Card can impact your credit utilization ratio too. The credit utilization ratio is the ratio of credit you're using to the total amount of credit you've been extended. Your credit utilization ratio impacts the 'amount owed' category of your FICO score. The 'amount owed' category comprises 30% of your credit score. Experts recommend keeping your credit utilization ratio under 30% or even 10% if you can. Since the card is paid off daily your credit utilization ratio will reset each day says Hellerstein. When your credit utilization ratio is reset frequently you're more likely to have a low utilization ratio. Having a low utilization ratio also has a positive impact on your credit score. The Extra Card charges no APR or interest because you have to pay off your balance daily. And unlike a credit card Extra won't let you spend more than you have in your bank account so you won't have to worry about overspending and potentially going into debt. In order to qualify for an Extra Card you don't need a credit score either. Extra doesn't perform credit checks but potential cardholders must meet these requirements: Applicants must be 18 years of age or older

You must have an SSN or ITIN number

Applicants must have a US address where you can receive your Extra Card (P.O. boxes are not valid)

Have a checking account at one of 10000 select U.S. banks

Have an iOS device (iPhone or iPad) or an Android device running version 10 or later According to Hellerstein 99% of applicants are approved for the card because all transactions on the card are backed by cash. When cardholders sign up for Extra they are given a spending limit based on the real-time balance of the bank account they choose to connect says Hellerstein.

Fees and rewards

Extra charges either an annual or monthly fee for cardholders. For Extra Credit Building you'll pay $8 a month but if you're willing to pay for the entire year upfront you'll get a slight discount and pay $84. For Extra Credit Building and Rewards you'll pay $12 a month or $108 for the entire year. For the higher price you'll gain access to the Extra Rewards program. Cardholders will earn 5 rewards points for every $1 they spend. Five rewards points are worth up to 1 cent so the redemption value is a only 0.2 cents per point. Essentially you're getting 1% back on all purchases if you redeem your points for max value. Extra has a rewards store available through the Extra App but the offerings in the store vary. According to Hellerstein recent popular items in the store include an electric toothbrush card games gift cards and AirPods. Since Extra is a debit card focused on building credit it's unsurprising that it offers few rewards and little flexibility in how cardholders can redeem their points. The Extra Card cannot be used internationally so there is no foreign transaction fee.

Alternatives to the Extra Card

Extra's fees can be quite a hefty price to pay for trying to raise your credit score. You might consider alternatives like a secured credit card which requires that you put down a deposit that acts as collateral if you don't pay your bills. Typically your credit line is equal to the amount of your deposit. Secured cards are much easier to be approved for if you have bad or no credit. When Select analyzed various secured cards to determine which cards were the best for people with no credit or bad credit and who wanted to improve their scores it ranked the Discover it® Secured Credit Card as the winner. With the Discover it® Secured Credit Card cardholders only need to put down a minimum $200 deposit for a credit line equal to that amount. Starting seven months after account opening Discover will evaluate your credit card account to determine if you can transition to an unsecured line of credit. If you don't want to put down a deposit you might consider the Petal® 1 ""No Annual Fee"" Visa® Credit Card which is catered to people with non-prime credit looking to improve their scores.

Petal® 1 ""No Annual Fee"" Visa® Credit Card Learn More Rewards 2% to 10% cash back at select merchants

Welcome bonus None

Annual fee $0

Intro APR N/A

Regular APR 25.24% - 34.74% variable

Balance transfer fee N/A

Foreign transaction fee None

Credit needed Fair/No Credit Terms apply.

The Petal 1 Card has no annual fee no welcome bonus and earns between 2% - 10% cash back at select merchants. With the Petal 1 Card you'll have to make your monthly payments each month in full or risk having to pay interest. Unlike the Extra card the Petal 1 Card reports to all three credit bureaus has no annual fee or foreign transaction fee (unlike Extra the Petal 1 can be used abroad). Additionally unlike the Extra Card the Petal 1 Card is a credit card so you'll have an entire month to pay off your bill.

Bottom line

The Extra Card can be a useful tool for people who aren't eligible for most credit cards but are looking to boost their credit scores. However the card does have an $8 monthly fee or an $84 annual fee so you might be better off getting a secured credit card with no annual fee in order to build your credit. Secured cards will require a security deposit but you'll typically receive the deposit back and will be eligible for an unsecured card after making your payments on time and in full for a few months. Extra Card also has downsides: Your card history is not reported to all three credit bureaus and it can't be used in foreign countries.

South Tama Schools finalized a sale of the property in the second half of 2021 to One Site Development LLC of Cedar Falls for a sum of $15000. The property has laid bare since 2007 when the school district demolished and buried the former STC Primary school building.

Current work is being done to excavate the buried materials to make way for construction of a new Family Dollar variety store to be built later this year.

In November the City of Tama Planning and Zoning Board recommended a change of zoning for the property to allow for commercial development. The Tama City Council approved the zoning recommendation at their regular December council meeting clearing the way for work to begin on the project.

Developer Jeff Stickfort said the 10500 square-foot building will bring a hybrid version of the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree retail brands that share corporate ownership.

The combination store concept is geared toward rural communities that otherwise would not see Dollar Tree stores opening up.

Entrances and exits to the store’s parking lot will come off 9th Street and 8th Street rather than go directly out into the four-lane Highway 63.

Stickfort said earlier this month the tentative plan was for construction to take about one year and for the store to open in early 2023.

A similar Family Dollar-Dollar Tree combo concept is also being constructed in Gladbrook along a similar timeline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkYW0uY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMzAvc3VzcGVjdC1jYXB0dXJlZC1qb25lcy1jby1idXJnbGFyeS1jYXNlL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkYW0uY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMzAvc3VzcGVjdC1jYXB0dXJlZC1qb25lcy1jby1idXJnbGFyeS1jYXNlLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Suspect captured in Jones Co. burglary case,"JONES COUNTY Miss.

Sean Davis 21 Laurel was taken into custody after deputies found him hiding in a field behind a residence on Sherwood Forest Road in the Pleasant Ridge community.

Davis is charged with commercial burglary after he allegedly burglarized the Dollar General on Indian Springs Road Thursday night.

CSD said Davis is at the Jones County Jail pending his initial appearance in court.

“Tips from the public led to the identification of Sean Davis as the suspect” Jones County Sheriff Joe Berlin said. “Great job by our investigators and reserve deputies in locating Sean Davis hiding overnight behind a residence. We are pretty good at playing the Hide-N-Seek game you know.”

(CJS) looks to open a new 8625 square-foot emergency youth shelter in Mulberry.

CJS which supports at-risk youth and families in crisis will relocate the Western Arkansas Youth Shelter to a former Dollar General building located at 120 W. 6th St. following renovations. The building was donated by the Palmer family of the PSA Land Company LLC.

The current building located in Cecil has provided emergency shelter for 14 male and female youth ages 10 to 17 since 1984.

Janice Justice executive director of Comprehensive Juvenile Services Inc. described the primary mission of the shelter to support family reunification.

“We work together with the families to help with reunification and working on the problems at home so that we can get [the youth] back safely … [with] better communication and better ways of handling things at home” Justice said.

The shelter is one of many services provided by CJS across western Arkansas including casework a re-entry program for delinquent offenses mentoring community service support groups and parenting classes.

CJS is a nonprofit organization that holds a contract with the Arkansas Department of Human Services Division of Youth Services. It is licensed by DHS as a child placement agency and an emergency residential child care facility.

Supporting youth in need

Around 100 to 150 teens are helped by the Western Arkansas Youth Shelter each year although that number has been slightly lower due to the coronavirus pandemic Justice said.

“It’s room and board for up to 60 days” she said. “It’s an emergency shelter … [and] the average length of stay is 19 to 20 days. Some of the kids are just there overnight or a couple of nights until we can get them back to where they belong.”

The shelter takes in teens facing difficult home situations resulting from family conflict and crisis youth at risk of delinquency runaways and homeless youth. They also have two spots for emergency placement in partnership with the Arkansas Department of Human Services Division of Children and Family Services until they can find a foster home or longer-term care for youth.

All admissions to the shelter are voluntary and most teens are placed by a CJS or DHS caseworker. All residents must have the consent of a guardian or in rare cases a court order. Runaway youth sign for themselves and the staff immediately begins working to contact the families for reunification.

It is not a detention center or jail Justice said. Instead the organization’s mission is to provide a safe space for youth that have no other place to go.

Residents are provided with a place to stay for up to 60 days with three meals a day group counseling sessions and recreational activities. They also continue their education with an on-site classroom.

“It works out much better for the kids … because they get individualized attention and they can work at their own pace” Justice said. “They’re able to catch up. A lot of them have school issues and that’s a lot of the reason they’re there.”

The shelter currently partners with the County Line School District and will work with the Mulberry School District at their new location.

The move to Mulberry

The shelter currently is in Franklin County which CJS no longer services as of the mid-1990s Justice said due to the state changing contracts from being over regions to being over judicial districts. This excluded Franklin County from the six counties CJS serves.

The shelter building is also 91 years old which requires extensive maintenance and costs for the organization for upkeep. CJS rents the building from the Western Arkansas County Judges Youth Shelter Inc. for $1 a year. From 1987 to 2021 maintenance costs for CJS have been more than $220000.

Justice said relocating allows CJS to be closer to much-needed services for residents including medical care and therapy appointments and with shorter commutes for employees and parents.

The new shelter will also have space for two additional residents allowing CJS to care for more youth in need.

New community partnerships

Justice looks forward to the new relationships the shelter will be able to develop with the Mulberry community.

Across from the new location is the Mulberry Community Food Pantry one of many places youth could volunteer.

“I’m hoping we will get the kids involved and working with that” she said. “... Hopefully people there will see that we are good community partners and we give back.”

The CJS community service program currently partners with other organizations in the region including Antioch for Youth & Family.

The Mulberry city planning and zoning committee recommended rezoning the property for the shelter Jan. 10 and the city council approved the rezoning Jan. 18.

During a neighborhood meeting held Jan. 6 prior to the rezoning approval Justice shared a presentation explaining the goals and work of CJS with community members against the relocation. She expressed gratitude for those who changed their minds about the shelter.

“Now all we have to do is continue to show people that it will be a positive thing for the community” she said.

How to help

Fundraising for the relocation is still ongoing and CJS is still seeking additional donors to complete the $1.7 million construction. The organization has been able to raise $1.05 million so far.

Holistic approach to self-care

By Jillian Manning | Jan. 29 2022

Kelly Young owns a dispensary but her goal isn’t to get you high. Instead at Torch Cannabis Co. in Central Lake Young promotes a holistic approach to self-care.

“My whole passion has been around helping people get access to [cannabis]” she says. “To learn how it works with their bodies so they can become their own health and wellness advocate.”

Hometown Girl

Young was born and raised in northern Michigan — delivered in fact at a roadside park at Birch Lake while her parents were on the way to Munson Hospital — and has always considered the area home. Her name is a familiar one north of Traverse City as her father Richard (Rick) Young has been the proprietor of the Village Market in Elk Rapids since 1974. Young herself did stints in the family business both in Elk Rapids and at the family’s grocery store in Central Lake.

“In 2011 my brother and I bought the Central Lake grocery store” Young says. “The footprint size of the store wasn’t big enough to really sustain all that we put into it to make it a good community grocery store so we knew we needed to expand it to make it bigger.”

The Young family purchased two buildings next door planning to tear them down and rebuild but community backlash put the plans on hold and the buildings sat vacant. Then the Dollar General opened down the street and “literally crushed” their business.

Young says the family was left with a tough choice: Let all of their employees go — or let one of the owners go. She decided to depart which kicked off the new and winding journey she’s found in the cannabis field.

A Pipe Dream

At the time cannabis had not yet been legalized in Michigan but Young saw promise in the emerging industry and wanted to get a foot in the door. She started researching the market and discovered a unique opportunity: cannabis extraction. Farmers growing cannabis often only use part of the plant and extraction experts process the “waste” in a lab environment to separate chemical compounds like CBD (an essential component of medical marijuana) and non-psychoactive TCHA which has an array of therapeutic uses.

Young acknowledges becoming a cannabis extractor was quite a leap from owning a grocery store and she laughs as she recounts her decision. “I basically turned in the keys to my Lexus and bought a one-ton pickup truck and a $50000 piece of extraction equipment and set off to start a new life. I really didn’t know what I was buying or what I was doing other than it was filling a need in the market.”

In those early days Young was one of only two mobile cannabis extractors in the entire country traveling to states like Colorado and California with her truck and trailer. Her work in extraction made her realize the myriad of uses for cannabis leaning into what she calls “geeky mad-scientist stuff.”

“I found out that when I make oil I can make it from hemp or I can make it from marijuana” she explains. “I did a lot of R&D with CBD products and figured out how to make my own CBD products.” That experimentation was what allowed her to find a way home.

Highs and Lows

Young returned to Michigan in 2018 ready to start a cannabis self-care revolution. She began selling a line of CBD products called MyTCBD at farmers markets around the region. She launched a nonprofit called Free Relief which gifted free THCA oil products to cancer patients and veterans with PTSD. And she started wondering what a brick-and-mortar location could look like.

The answer brought her back to her days at the Village Market. Young recalls thinking to herself: “I have these buildings in downtown Central Lake that are old and decrepit that should be torn down. And I’m going to try to make a marijuana dispensary out of it.”

The path wasn’t as simple as she’d expected. To open a dispensary Young had to get approval from the Central Lake community. The first time she got her request on the ballot in March 2020 it didn’t pass. The second time in November 2020 it was on the ticket that sparked the Antrim Country election issues. When the results were finally confirmed she discovered her measure had passed by a single vote.

Years in the making Torch Cannabis Co.’s storefront at 7957 State St. in Central Lake opened November 17 2021.

A Growing Business

The reception from the community has been warm Young tell us. Her products offer a unique entry point into cannabis: Rather than being a “pot shop” for folks looking to get high she’s helping people address health and wellness concerns. Her core customer is over the age of 50 and is often looking for help with sleep or pain.

“They’re tired of the pills that the doctors are giving them and they’re tired of drinking their way through trying to cope with life” says Young. “I offer people a one-on-one personalized approach. I’m not a doctor so I can’t treat diagnose or cure … but I can tell you an Indica is traditionally known to help people sleep and Sativa is traditionally known to help people stay awake and be productive.”

She adds that those personal consultations are important since “everybody’s body is different” and diet exercise alcohol or caffeine use and overall mental health can play a role in how cannabis affects a customer’s body.

As the demand for her services grows Young has big plans for the next stages of Torch Cannabis Co. Starting in February Young will offer delivery service to towns like Traverse City and Petoskey and this summer she’ll launch a new product line.

With all those balls in the air Young had to make the difficult decision to close down her nonprofit Free Relief. But that doesn’t mean her outreach to those communities is at an end.

“Anybody who has cancer or veterans with PTSD that were interested in Free Relief can come to the dispensary and get a free bottle of CBD” she says. “That’s all part of this whole mission. It’s not about what you’re getting: it’s about giving back.”"

South Tama Schools finalized a sale of the property in the second half of 2021 to One Site Development LLC of Cedar Falls for a sum of $15000. The property has laid bare since 2007 when the school district demolished and buried the former STC Primary school building.

Current work is being done to excavate the buried materials to make way for construction of a new Family Dollar variety store to be built later this year.

In November the City of Tama Planning and Zoning Board recommended a change of zoning for the property to allow for commercial development. The Tama City Council approved the zoning recommendation at their regular December council meeting clearing the way for work to begin on the project.

Developer Jeff Stickfort said the 10500 square-foot building will bring a hybrid version of the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree retail brands that share corporate ownership.

The combination store concept is geared toward rural communities that otherwise would not see Dollar Tree stores opening up.

Entrances and exits to the store’s parking lot will come off 9th Street and 8th Street rather than go directly out into the four-lane Highway 63.

Stickfort said earlier this month the tentative plan was for construction to take about one year and for the store to open in early 2023.

A similar Family Dollar-Dollar Tree combo concept is also being constructed in Gladbrook along a similar timeline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2J0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9uZXctbGlmZS1jb3VsZC1iZS1icmVhdGhlZC1pbnRvLW5vcnRoLWRla2FsYi1tYWxsLWJhc2VkLXBsYW5zLWJ5LWRldmVsb3BlcnMvSlBKSlROVUxEWkdaTkNJNVVITE1USkpSQzQv0gGXAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzYnR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25ldy1saWZlLWNvdWxkLWJlLWJyZWF0aGVkLWludG8tbm9ydGgtZGVrYWxiLW1hbGwtYmFzZWQtcGxhbnMtYnktZGV2ZWxvcGVycy9KUEpKVE5VTERaR1pOQ0k1VUhMTVRKSlJDNC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New life could be breathed into North Dekalb Mall based on plans by developers,"We’re Sorry!

That could change.

Dominion Energy South Carolina released a 15-year integrated resource plan calling for the plant to burn all natural gas beginning in 2030.

“Dominion Energy is on a trajectory to achieve our goal of net-zero carbon dioxide and methane spokesman Matt Long said. “The modified 2020 (integrated resource plan) highlights details about how DESC has already reduced our dependence on coal generation increased our percentage of solar generation and created a cleaner generation fleet.”

“The plan also presents alternatives that could be pursued in the future to provide customers a path to clean renewable energy while allowing technologies to mature” Long said.

When it was originally placed in service in 1996 the Cope plant was designed for operation on coal and natural gas up to its full design capacity of 415 MW.

The Cope plant has the ability to operate up to its full original design capacity when using natural gas. The station frequently operates up to this load when natural gas supplies are available and economical Long said.

Converting the plant from its current dual-fuel capability to gas-only will not require any physical modifications Long said. No staffing changes have been announced based on that plan.

Currently the Cope plant employs 65 and pays about $9 million annually in taxes to Orangeburg County.

“Since the plan proposes that Cope Station continue operating DESC would not anticipate a major change in property tax as a result of the plan” Long said.

The plant formerly owned by South Carolina Electric and Gas has a number of environmental controls designed to reduce sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions.

“Natural gas operations emit significantly lower amounts of carbon dioxide per megawatt of energy generated compared to coal” Long said. “Natural gas combustion also emits less nitrous oxides sulfur dioxide mercury and particulate matter than coal combustion.”

As part of its plan Dominion will shut down operations at two of its other coal-fired plants by 2028. The plants are its Wateree Station south of Columbia and the Williams Station north of Charleston.

The Cope Station has generated electricity by burning about 160 tons of coal per hour. At full load the plant can produce enough power in one hour to supply the average electric needs of 430 residential customers for one month.

The facility has consistently ranked in the top 20 plants for efficiency according to Electric Light & Power magazine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybGluZ3RvbnZhLnVzL0dvdmVybm1lbnQvUHJvamVjdHMvUHJvamVjdC1UeXBlcy9VbmNhdGVnb3Jpc2VkL1N0cmVldGxpZ2h0cy1NYW5hZ2VtZW50LVBsYW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Streetlights Management Plan – Official Website of Arlington County Virginia Government,"Streetlights Management Plan

The Streetlight Management Plan (SMP) public process was completed in early 2019 upon receipt of public comments on the draft plan. The final plan was released and became effective in February 2020 after thorough internal review and coordination with existing County plans and projects.

Thank you to the SMP Advisory Panel members for their input and guidance and the residents who participated in this thorough and engaging project. Together we worked to design a guide that standardizes our streetlight program while incorporating innovative and sustainable technology for the future of streetlights in Arlington.

The core principles and standards have been adopted including:

Lower color temperature standard for LED lights – 3000 degrees Kelvin for residential streets 4000 degrees Kelvin for commercial and mixed-use areas

More choices of county-owned light styles – Carlyle in commercial areas Cobra in residential areas

Ownership districting – moving towards County ownership in commercial areas and Dominion Energy ownership in residential areas

Arlington has made several improvements including:

Staff worked on procuring new equipment per the new SMP standards that will help us meet defined maintenance service levels.

Staff participated in negotiations with Dominion to improve and update their streetlight service including: Significantly reducing the cost of LED lights through VEPGA negotiation Offering LED lights and replacing HPS lights through their regular maintenance activities. Following the new county standards to provide a more adequate light distribution pattern. Committing to make their LED lighting program smart city ready.



Staff has also worked with Dominion to establish a three-month “backlog clearing” project in which Dominion has committed to repair all overdue outages. Staff continuously coordinates with Dominion to sustain a reasonable maintenance service level.

Project Description

The Streetlight Management Plan (SMP) focuses on researching new streetlight technology investigating ways to enhance the appearance of our streetscapes updating lighting standards and improving outage reporting. The SMP will also guide County staff on the selection of future streetlight technology optimization of maintenance and general service delivery needs.

The SMP Community Advisory Panel will provide a forum for key stakeholders to advise County staff on safety sustainability (energy savings health environmental impacts) technology and streetscape priorities.

Planning Process Background:

The planning process began in the fall of 2015 and has consisted of collecting data and conducting research and analysis. This includes: assessing the County’s current streetlight inventory and operations; partnerships with other agencies (such as Dominion Virginia Power); and best practices among similar jurisdictions. For general information on streetlights in Arlington visit our streetlights website.

Streetlight Demonstration

In mid-January new LED streetlights were temporarily installed for a streetlight demonstration. During this time two streetlight demonstration tours for the Streetlight Community Advisory Panel and public were hosted by the County on Wednesday May 2 and Saturday May 12 to share more about the streetlight technology and different products. The following locations were selected:

S Irving St between 7th St S and 9th St S

S Ivy St between 7th St S and 9th St S

9th St S between S Ivy St and S Quincy St

6th St S between S Glebe Rd and S Quincy St

7th St S between S Glebe Rd and S Quincy St

8th St S between S Glebe Rd and S Quincy St

Columbia Pike between S Oakland St and S Veitch St

George Mason Dr between Lee Hwy and Washington Blvd

View a map of the commercial and residential streetlight locations.

Streetlights for the demonstration have been removed and the original streetlights have been re-installed.

Public Engagement Process

In May 2018 Arlington County hosted two field demonstration tours to: educate the community about the streetlight management plan; provide an overview of the technology and different products under consideration; and to listen to community feedback. Over 60 residents registered for the tours. An additional field demonstration was held with surrounding jurisdictions and partners.

Over 700 participants shared input via the County’s online comment form. A summary of the public feedback will be available online later this summer.

The streetlights will also be evaluated from a technical standard. This along with the public feedback will inform our streetlight management plan.

The band consists of guitarist and vocalist John Cooper guitarist and pianist Korey Cooper drummer and vocalist Jen Ledger and guitarist Seth Morrison. Skillet has been my favorite band since my teenage years.

Riff Magazine wrote that “Dominion” delivered big anthemic songs and plenty for the band’s fans to love.

There are 12 songs on the album. “Surviving the Game” and “Dominion” are two songs that stand out the most.

“Surviving the Game” has an incredible music video and captivating lyrics. The music video had red smoke whenever there was a guitar riff all the band members were going to go the distance to overcome what the battle was no matter who was in the way the area where the music video was done was in a desert.

With lyrics like this: “To be more than a conqueror you have to learn to enjoy the pain if you want to survive the game” and “victories for the brave one who never bow a knee when it’s do or die” it is easy to get these songs stuck in your head.

The second song on the album that is my favorite is actually the album name “Dominion.” This song is one of my favorites because there is so much power energy and positivity that comes from this song. The strong lyrics the many guitar solos that are present and the way the audio is done

There are a few songs that are decent but not as good as the others. One of those songs is the 11th song “Ignite.”

This song does have some good guitar riffs in it but the song doesn’t have much energy. It barely has any guitar solos in it and the song felt like it was on a constant repeat for the entire three minutes and 41 seconds.

The second decent song was the 10th song titled “Forever or The End.” The song had a lot of piano sounds in it and is one of their softer and calmer songs on the album. It has almost no guitar riff or solos. This song sounds similar to the song “Watching for Comets” that was on their “Unleashed” album that was released in 2016.

The reason why this song is similar to “Watching for Comets” is because of the similar sound the way that they are both love songs and the beats are very similar.

Overall this album is one that I highly recommend you go and listen to at some point during your day. Another reason you should listen to this album is because it will make you feel better because the lyrics are uplifting the music is great and the album cover is awesome to look at."

Has any food had a better glow-up than the chicken wing? Formerly seen by many as a throwaway part of the bird chicken wings found new meaning in the 1960s as a delicious hot sauce-coated finger food (via USA Today). The mind behind their re-purposing is still debated. However one thing that's for sure is that whoever whipped up that first batch of hot wings certainly did a favor for Americans who according to C Store Decisions were expected to chow down on a whopping 1.42 billion wings during last year's Super Bowl alone.

In addition to becoming an integral part of the menu on football's biggest night of the year wings have also found a BFF in none other than pizza during their journey to stardom. Per Thrillist La Nova Pizzeria (located in Buffalo New York of course) was the instigator of this now-iconic pairing which gained serious attention after the restaurant began offering the dishes together in pizza packs in the '90s. By the end of the decade wings and 'za could be found on the menu at nearly every major pizza chain including Domino's where you can still pick up the duo of delicacies today.

January is a difficult month for many households with money tight after the festive period and the long wait for payday.

But a good takeaway can alleviate them pressures despite the pricey outlay particularly if you are on a spending ban or a health kick to start 2022.

Takeaways can cost upwards of £20 - and that's with a deal - so why do we go to the expensive chain restaurants rather than look in our freezers?

Dayna Farrington - a Black Country Life Writer for Birmingham Mail - decided to put the theory to the test as her family-of-four compare popular takeaway Domino's Pizza against Aldi's 'fakeaway' Carlos pizza range.

Pizzas sides and desserts from both chains were analysed and ranked by taste and value and the results may surprise you.

Domino's

Pizzas - Medium original cheese and tomato and medium Meateor (however BBQ sauce sausage bacon and beef were removed and ham and tomato sauce were added to try and make it as similar as we could to the Aldi pizza) - £17.99 Two for Tuesday deal.

Sides - Garlic pizza bread - £4.49. Garlic and herb big dip - £1.25.

Desserts - Domino's cookies - £4.99.

Total - £28.72 (£42.72 without the deal).

""We ordered two pizzas from Domino's - and luckily for us on the day of our taste test there was an offer on Two for Tuesday"" Ms Farrington said.

""Therefore we managed to save a little bit more money with a buy one get one free deal. However Domino's pretty much always has a deal on - so it's worth scouting these out.

""The Meateor pizza - which had ham pepperoni and meatballs on - was a huge hit. It had lots of flavours all combined and the dough tasted fresh - you could tell they had been handmade to perfection and freshly cooked.

""So much so it was given really high marks in our taste-test - with the 10-year-old giving it a 10/10 !

""The cheese and tomato one however was a little more disappointing. We felt it was much more tomato-y than cheese-y. We needed a bit more cheese!

""However it was still delicious - just not on par with the previous pizza. The cheese that was there was gooey and the sauce really was tangy.

""On average we gave this an 8.5/10 .

""Moving onto the garlic pizza bread it was soft and definitely flavoursome. But I don't feel like you get a lot for your money - four small slices for £4.49. It was given an average score of 7/10 at home this time.

""And last but not least the cookies. I'm usually too full up on pizza to even contemplate eating any more food - but I've been told that these are some top tier cookies.

""And they were some good stuff. Gooey melt in the middle and so soft. But a little on the small side.

""They weren't the biggest cookies we have seen but overall we gave them a good 8.5/10 .""

Aldi

Pizzas - Classic crust with big cheese pizza - £1.69. Fully loaded meat feast - £3.29.

Sides - Garlic pizza - £1.09. Garlic and herb dip - 89p.

Desserts - Cookies - £1.69.

Total - £8.25 (£20.47 cheaper).

""We will start with the meaty pizza. The Carlos Fully Loaded Takeaway meat feast pizza box states it is loaded with mozzarella cheese pepperoni meatballs and ham"" she said.

""And I must say we were all disappointed. In fact the children couldn't even finish theirs.

""We felt the meats lacked any flavour and there was a distinct lack of cheese!. I need cheese on pizza. On average scored a 5/10 from us.

""Onto the cheese pizza it actually had more cheese on - which is a win win for me.

""However it wasn't as popular in other members of the family - but scored a comfortable average of 7/10 from us.""

On the garlic pizza Ms Farrington added: ""I thought it was just as good as the Domino's garlic bread. I thought it tasted a little cheesier actually which was nice.

""My other half however thought it was a little dry. It scored an average of 7/10 in the house.

""And the cookies! My friend had told me these were a must on her Aldi shopping list - so I had high hopes before I'd tried them. We were not disappointed.

""They were much chunkier and had a lot more taste. Yes they weren't as gooey as Domino's but they really didn't need to be. It was a solid 9/10 for us.

Overall

""We were left really surprised. Domino's always feels like the far superior one when it comes to pizza.

""But they are extremely overpriced - and when you can't find any deals you can be left very out of pocket.

""There's nothing better than a freshly made pizza landing on your doorstep when all you've had to do is a couple of clicks on your phone and it's ordered.

""There's a bit more work put into Aldi - and I suppose when you have cooked it yourself it never tastes as good. But there's not much work into putting frozen pizzas in the oven is there?

Mothering While Black: Raising African American Boys and Girls and Confronting Gendered Racism

Associate Professor University of Maryland

Friday 12th November 2:30 pm - 4 pm (OSC location for internal audience or online via Zoom)

Recent events have underscored the harsh and at times tragic consequences of gendered racism-racial discrimination that varies based on gender- for African American children in the U.S. How do African American middle-class mothers address these challenges?

Through in-depth interviews with African American middle- and upper-middle-class mothers Dr. Dow will discuss how gendered racism influences these mothers' concerns for their sons and daughters and how it influences how they approach parenting their children. Dr. Dow describes how for their sons mothers were principally concerned with preventing perceptions of them as criminals or ""thugs"" and protecting their physical safety. By contrast mothers were principally concerned with protecting and building their daughters' self-esteem and self-value. Mothers used different strategies to help their sons and daughters navigate these challenges.

These mothers' experiences illuminate how they prepare their children for the different societal reception they believe their sons and daughters will encounter and shed light on the work needed to build racial empathy and understanding in the contemporary era.

Dr. Dawn M. Dow is an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland College Park a Faculty Associate in the Maryland Population Research Center the deputy editor for the Journal of Marriage and Family and an editorial board member of Contexts.

From 2019-2021 she served as the faculty director of the Critical Race Initiative. Dr. Dow received a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of California Berkeley and earned a J.D. from Columbia University School of Law.

Her research examines intersections of race class and gender within the context of the family educational settings the workplace the law and political mobilization.

She is the author of the award-winning book Mothering While Black: Boundaries and Burdens of Middle-Class Parenthood (2019) published by the University of California Press. Dr. Dow's work has appeared in journals including Gender & Society Journal of Marriage and Family Sociology of Race & Ethnicity Science Advances and Mobilization.

Strategic plan:Santa Rosa Schools are setting goals for the next 5 years but they need input | Guestview

As we embrace a culture of continuous improvement the school district is simultaneously implementing a five-year accreditation process as well as the development of a five-year strategic plan. Recently stakeholders including students parents community and employees completed over 33000 stakeholder surveys and over 500 participated in one of six town halls. To further engage participants individual interviews were conducted to ensure the district received feedback and direction from all especially our students and families. This feedback will be critical to the development of the strategic plan that will guide the continued improvement of the school district from 2022-2027. We appreciate all who participated in this process!

Ensuring the district has adequate facilities for incoming students construction of new schools is occurring at a rapid pace. East Bay K-8 opened its doors to over 900 students in August of 2021 and Pace K-8 is currently under construction with an estimated opening of August 2023. There is also a need for additional high schools. The school district purchased property in South Santa Rosa County and Dag Architects was selected to develop the architectural design of the school.

M&P Land LLC plans to develop 48 townhouses on about three acres of the Sixo-1 project site. This site includes 65 acres adjacent to Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College on St. Matthews Road. St. Matthews Road is also known as U.S. 601.

In conjunction with Gateway One Development LLC the second project will feature 177 single-family homes on a 60-acre tract of land on Bruin Parkway and will be named The Park at Wilkinson. The development will be across from the Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School ball fields.

The residential developments are just one part of a larger development planned for the U.S. 601 corridor.

In August 2020 Andrew Silver announced plans to build what is called the The Sixo 1 Project a project complete with dining retail entertainment lodging and residential.

""These (residential) developments will be centered around the 601 lifestyle center"" M&P Land LLC President and co-owner Andrew Silver told those gathered for the announcement at the Orangeburg County Development Commission earlier in August. ""It is also near the Y club as well. It is about accessibility. It will help support the community and what is available at the moment and forthcoming years to come.""

Ground is expected to be broken on both residential projects during the first quarter of 2022 with occupancy expected within six months after groundbreaking.

The developments will include single-family detached homes ranging from 1700-square-feet to 2500-square feet. Home price range will be from $180000 to $350000.

Home styles will also include townhomes and freedom homes that are geared toward an active adult community.

""We have a seat for everybody"" D.R. Horton Land Acquisition Manager Phil Bradley said noting the company is excited be entering the Orangeburg market and a ""growing community.""

The residential developments would have amenities such as a ballpark cabana or playground.

""We have several different options we can do"" Bradley said.

Silver said the residential component of the project has been in discussion for the past 1-1/2 year to two years.

Silver thanked all the partners in the project including the property owners the home builder the professional team at M&P Land and county leaders for their support in the project.

The projects are entirely privately funded.

D.R. Horton will construct the homes. Gateway One Development will be undertaking the groundworks.

Silver and his wife Emilee own M&P Land. Silver also owns Gateway One along with Mike O'Cain and Chad Rast of O'Cain Construction.

""We are looking at a micro metropolis within that 601 corridor"" Silver said noting that over the next five years he expects the $100 million project to bring a minimum of 500 to 1000 homes to the area all ""wrapped around the 601 development.""

Silver has touted the Sixo 1 project as creating hundreds of jobs as well as spurring economic development for the City of Orangeburg by the way of utility usage. It would generate income for Orangeburg County by the way of property and business taxes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MtcHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L21hcmtldHBsYWNlL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLzIwMjIvMDEvMjkvcGFyYWRlLWhvbWVzLW1hcmNoZXMtZG93bi1uZXctcGF0aC82NjM3MzE5MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Parade of Homes marches down a new path,"Andrea Stetson

Special to Fort Myers News-Press

The Lee Building Industry Association’s (BIA) 36th annual Parade of Homes is moving down a new path this year due to the severe lack of models in Southwest Florida. For the first time there are no high end custom builders participating. They have no models since they are sold now usually before the drywall even gets up. Instead the BIA is trying something new by allowing some showrooms to be part of the parade. There are also six standard production builders showcasing models.

“Entries are down this year because so many are sold” said Savanah Phillips events and marketing director for Lee BIA.

Phillips hopes people will attend the parade and take a look at the showrooms to get ideas for their own homes.

“People looking for ideas of redoing their homes” Phillips explained. “In the past it has always been houses but we switched it up this year because we knew we would be low on the houses. You kind of have to evolve. Throwing in those showrooms adds that new aspect.”

Bruce Zachritz showroom director at Monark Premium Appliance in Bonita Springs is eager to be part of the parade for the first time.

“I am excited about it” Zachritz began. “It is something I have been pushing. All the custom builders use our showrooms for their clients. This way the public can come though on the tour and see some of our ideas. It’s an idea place.”

The showroom is set up to look like rooms in a home. For example people can see a kitchen with modern sleek white cabinets and the refrigerator and freezer hidden behind them. They can also see a more traditional kitchen a wine refrigerator and other appliances.

“It’s a win win” Zachritz said. “They get ideas of what their builder can do for them. I am partnering with remodelers and developers but we are open to the public. They can buy like a builder right from us. We will staff our sales people and be open as a courtesy to the Parade of Homes.”

Florida Design Works in Fort Myers is another showroom participant.

“We are really excited because the Parade of Homes has always been a wonderful event so to be able to take advantage of an established event we are so excited” said Jennifer Horvat marketing director. “Our showroom is already set up to be a one stop shop for homeowners. Anything we can do to be part of the community is important to us. We are part of the fabric of the neighborhoods.”

Horvat said one thing people will appreciate is that they have a lot of things in stock and can get it to a customer quickly.

“When you walk in you will know what is in stock and what can be delivered immediately” she explained. “We have millions of dollars in options ready to go.”

There are also 24 models to tour. Taylor Morrison Pulte Lennar DR Horton and Mattamy Homes will be featuring their unsold models.

Justin Wood director of sales for Pulte Group says that benefits his company that will have 10 homes entered.

“Anytime you have less busyness that can distract people to other things it definitely benefits us” he said. “It is refreshing to have a much more similar process. We are all production builders and we share that similarity.”

Scott Schilling area sales manager for Lennar agrees.

“I think it helps us” he said. “People still want to buy homes. They are driven to us.”

Gary Aubuchon owner of Aubuchon Homes still wanted a small part in the event so his sold model the Carlton will have a virtual tour on the BIA Parade of Homes website. Aubuchon said the benefit of a virtual tour is that people can see it 24/7 and not just during event times.

“There has been movement toward the virtual world where people can go online and take a virtual tour of a model that was built at one time or one that was never built but is a virtual reality” Aubuchon explained. “I think there will always be a place for Parade of Homes because people always want to touch and feel but I think going forward the emphasis of Parade of Homes will be less than it has been historically.”

Aubuchon now has another model on the drawing board but not yet under construction.

Ryan Morgan marketing specialist for Florida Lifestyle Homes said their model went under contract during the drywall stage so they have nothing for the Parade of Homes.

“It happens almost all the time now” Morgan said. “We don’t have the inventory right now. We do have several upcoming projects but nothing finished.”

The lack of custom models left the Parade of Homes without a cover house so Phillips came up with a new idea. Gulf Western Roofing is this year’s platinum sponsor and cover design.

“They are the face of the parade” Phillips explained. “They are the top sponsor and they are helping make this parade possible.”

Last year there were about 40 homes in the BIA Parade of Homes. Phillips said the pandemic made that number lower than in previous years but not as low as this year.

“It is usually 50-60 in a typical year but nothing has been typical the last two years” she concluded.

LOUIS — Katie Horton has worked virtually from her home in Ballwin throughout the pandemic. But over the past two weeks she has spent her weekends and evenings scrubbing patient rooms and assisting nurses caring for COVID-19 patients at Mercy South Hospital.

Horton 49 is a talent selection manager for Mercy helping hire all the nonclinical positions such as food service public safety and clerical within the multistate hospital system.

Two weeks ago she answered a plea from Mercy asking employees to leave office chairs and help front-line hospital workers overwhelmed and weakened by the new COVID-19 variant.

“It was eye-opening. I work from home. I’ve been very safe through it all and that has certainly been a blessing” she said. “I just felt like it was good to be able to see through the eyes of the person doing these jobs.”

In an effort to maintain patient care during a record-breaking surge of COVID-19 patients health systems across Missouri are asking all employees to pick up shifts helping nurses by doing things like grabbing supplies or answering phones or by filling absences in areas such housekeeping and patient transport.

“Hospital administrators are pushing wheelchairs accountants are emptying trash cans and marketing professionals are serving meals — whatever it takes to make sure that our co-workers who provide hands-on patient care are able to focus on their patients” said Steve Mackin Mercy’s incoming president.

Whether they are called “Team 19” at CoxHealth in Springfield Missouri or “shared-service employees” at BJC HealthCare in the St. Louis area hundreds of office and outpatient employees are switching roles and offering to work extra inside hospitals. Many do so after working their regular jobs earning some extra pay.

In late December the hyper-infectious omicron variant caused a sharp spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations which peaked at the highest level in the St. Louis region on Jan. 17. The disease swept through staff just as quickly causing large numbers to have to stay home while they cared for themselves or their family members.

It is a crushing blow to a workforce already severely strained by the nearly two-year-long pandemic.

Though COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have been trending lower in the St. Louis area for nearly two weeks the number of patients and deaths remain near the highest levels in the pandemic.

“Our hospitals remain full our emergency departments are full and there’s not a lot of room in our (intensive care units) either” said Dr. Alex Garza co-director of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force. “So although this is improving many of our staff continue to be out because of COVID or because they are taking care of a loved one or a child whose school has unfortunately closed because of COVID.”

Misty Jones vice president of operations for SSM Health St. Louis said even nonclinical tasks such taking a patient to get an X-ray or delivering meals are being done by nurses and other front-line providers.

“If there’s not enough dining and nutrition staff because patients have to eat that work falls on nursing to make sure those trays get passed in a timely manner” Jones said.

Worried about the physical and mental exhaustion among workers leaders hope that others stepping up to help also boosts morale.

“This is the tide-turn at this point. They have struggled but they have managed but they can’t do this alone” Jones said. “This is a show of force of the system leaning in and saying we are here to help you. We see you we want to help. It is reaching out with empathy being present with our front-line staff and saying you are not alone.”

Chaos every shift

Lisa Nesler works at an outpatient infusion center at Mercy’s large Clayton-Clarkson clinic in Ballwin. She administers intravenous medications such as chemotherapy for cancer patients. She’s a registered nurse but she hasn’t worked inside a hospital in 18 years she said.

When she saw a request for help Nesler 54 of Chesterfield said the need was too great to ignore. She didn’t expect to get assigned to help in the emergency department at Mercy St. Louis.

“I thought ‘Oh my gosh what did I just get myself into?’” Nesler said. “I think my heart rate was 150 when I was walking into that building.”

When she arrived for her eight-hour shift at 7 a.m. the waiting room was packed. Patients had been waiting six to eight hours to get admitted to a room. Some were angry.

Her assignment was to draw blood from patients in triage which she did the entire shift. “I stopped counting after 30” she said. She was surprised what a great day it turned out to be.

“What really struck me was how kind and appreciative the staff were” Nesler said. “I just left that day feeling so good that I really helped the people that I went in to help.”

Katie Kluesner 25 of Washington Missouri was working in the emergency department that day. Kluesner has been an emergency room nurse for three years. During this latest surge she ends up crying in her car after her shifts. Or she goes home and collapses in bed.

“We’ll have 40 or 50 people out there (waiting) and they just keep coming” Kluesner said. “So the triage process just keeps going and we are constantly behind.”

With Nesler’s help Kluesner was able to put in orders for laboratory tests while she drew blood. That helped physicians see patients faster. It also helped to more quickly identify patients who were sicker and needed to move up in the line to see a doctor.

“You just know you are walking into complete chaos every shift so having people help us do these little tasks really takes a load off” Kluesner said.

Nesler also worked in a surgical trauma unit where she was able to feed dress and bathe patients or help them take a walk. She spent most of her time with one confused patient who kept trying to get out of bed. Nesler brushed his teeth combed his hair and shaved his face.

“All those little things take so much time” she said. “It just made me feel really good to do those things for those patients and help the staff do all those things they don’t always have time to do.”

A Band-Aid

Jon Bray is a senior performance improvement consultant at BJC HealthCare’s Barnes-Jewish Hospital. He meets virtually or in-person with directors in different units coaching them on everything from improving infection rates to how to communicate better with staff or work a new computer program.

Bray constantly reminds the directors of the hospital’s mission to provide world-class care. When the call came out to help the strained hospital system “I thought this is something I need to do” he said.

Bray 33 of St. Louis has worked four four-hour shifts at Barnes-Jewish Hospital over the past few weeks donning purple scrubs for employees in training cleaning elevators and stairwells wiping tables and taking out trash in the café.

“At first I thought this is nothing I’m just cleaning an elevator” Bray said. But as he cleaned the floor of food wrappers discarded masks and even spit he realized how important the work was in making families feel comfortable.

“I would hate for a family member to come in and see this and think that that represents our hospital because it doesn’t” he said. “I know even more so now than before how valuable the work is.”

Lisa Witzel 47 of south St. Louis County works in the safety and quality department at SSM Health DePaul Hospital reviewing reports and pouring over data. She took the job in July leaving her career as an emergency room nurse.

Offering to assist in the emergency department allowed her to get back and help those she remains close through a tough time.

“I still feel for my people that are still in the middle of it” Witzel said. “Anything I can do to help them out even if it’s small I know it’s helpful because I’ve been in their shoes.”

Hospital leaders say they imagine the assistance programs will last about another month and gradually phase out as hospitalizations and staffing levels stabilize.

Carla Ashmead oversees the program for BJC HealthCare as the director of patient care and operations. She said it’s been a much-needed Band-Aid on a bleeding system.

Ashmead said “Anytime that you can decrease the workload of the team it’s definitely a morale booster. Is it perfect? No but it does help make things better.”

A tiny gesture

Horton who left her virtual home office in Ballwin started out working side-by-side with housekeeping workers at Mercy South in the evenings. They prepared rooms for new patients. Horton stripped linens took out trash mopped floors disinfected every surface and restocked items.

Some wondered why she was there if someone was making her do it. “No I just heard you all need help and I work a job where I’m able to come in the evening and help out” Horton told them.

Another felt uneasy about making her mop floors she said but she insisted and asked them to show her if she wasn’t doing it right.

As one worker was ending her shift she told the next co-worker starting “This lady can help you. She’s really nice.”

That made Horton feel like they knew she genuinely wanted to pitch in.

“Hopefully they see people care and appreciate and understand how much they give of themselves each and every day” she said.

Horton also worked eight hours on a Saturday and four on a Sunday assisting nurses in units with critically ill patients many of whom had COVID-19.

When the nurses were inside a COVID-19 patient’s room Horton would get them things they needed such as patient gowns or gloves or even another nurse. That saved them from having to throw away personal protective equipment and don new ones each time they left and entered a room.

Horton answered patient call lights. She cleaned counters restocked supplies and helped a transporter by carrying the personal items of a patient leaving in a wheelchair with an oxygen tank.

It was humbling she said. She watched as nurses hugged family members of a patient who died. She watched them put off telling a patient her husband had died so she wouldn’t lose the will to live.

“Those are just two examples and I just think how they do this day in and day out” Horton said. “I was just in awe of their emotional mental and physical tenacity the armor that they probably wear daily to do their job and the compassion.”

Horton also cleaned their break room wiping up coffee spills organizing the condiments throwing away trash and making the tables shine. It seemed like a tiny gesture but maybe it would feel a little nicer the next time they had a moment to sit down.

A nurse later stopped Horton and asked if she was the one who had cleaned the room. “Oh my god thank you!” the nurse told her.

“No no no” Horton said. “Thank you for what you are doing day in and day out.”

The project calls for 12 575-foot turbines to be built on land on Whealkate Bluff in Adams Township. After neighboring Stanton Township imposed a nine-month moratorium on permits for commercial solar and wind projects Circle Power moved four of the turbines which had been planned for Stanton Township into Adams.

With the purchase of additional land Circle Power will also be able to site turbines further away from homes to the north Circle Power partner Chris Moore said in an interview.

Adams Township which imposed a six-month moratorium reestablished its planning commission and is weighing a zoning ordinance. Moore said Circle Power’s counsel had written a letter to the township outlining what it saw as deficiencies in the zoning process though he did not go into specifics.

“We don’t think it’s being put in place properly… potentially nobody likes zoning but zoning that’s not done correctly is bad for everybody because you can’t rely on it” he said.

Elise Matz a member of the Circle Power Renewables staff said the project complied with the existing requirements of the township’s police powers ordinance. That includes a 3000-foot setback from the nearest non-participating property. It is also close to a mile from the nearest home in the township she said. Circle Power said the noise would not exceed 40 decibels at the nearest property line.

“This project is really appropriately scaled to the Keweenaw and is going to have a minimal impact on the folks of South Range and Adams Township” Matz said.

Circle Power sent a mailer to Adams Township residents touting the benefits of its program.

Circle Power said it would provide $15.9 million in property taxes over a 30-year period. Adams Township Schools would see the largest amount at $6.8 million. As the state government sets the formula for operational funding the money would be used to pay down debt Circle Power said. Houghton County would receive $6.1 million the Copper Country Intermediate School District $2 million and Adams Township $940000. The state would get the rest — $1.7 million going to the Michigan Educational Tax.

In a release the Guardians of the Keweenaw Ridge a citizens’ group formed in opposition to the project disputed the benefits pointing to a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study showing wind project revenues had not improved graduation rates or other student outcomes in Texas.

Residents have been skeptical of property tax benefits pointing to a Michigan Tax Tribunal ruling on a DTE Energy wind farm project last year that would result in lower required payments for alternative energy projects. However Moore said Circle Power is willing to guarantee revenues to the township Adams Township Schools the Copper Country Intermediate School District and Houghton County through a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreement. The agreement would set up a payment schedule for the duration of the project.

“Rather than rely on taxes or try and wiggle out of their tax commitments Circle is going in the opposite direction and is willing to commit to the $15.9 million number against any decreases in future tax revenue if the laws were to change” said Elise Matz part of the Circle Power Renewables staff.

An estimated $4 million would also be spent locally during construction Moore said.

However many of the short-term jobs could go to out-of-state workers the Guardians of the Keweenaw Ridge said. And the project will not be a large jobs driver long-term the Guardians said citing a presentation by Sarah Mills a researcher at the University of Michigan’s Graham Sustainability Institute.

At 3.5 cents per kilowatt hour the Scotia Wind project would have the lowest-cost renewable energy rate ever reported to the Michigan Public Service Commission which regulates utilities in the state Moore said. The lower rate UPPCO would have to pay for electricity would then be factored into MPSC’s decision-making when setting rates Matz said.

“If you have a really low cost per kilowatt hour that’s what’s being passed along through the ratemaking process and on your bill” she said. “It’s not just UPPCO saying that. Other folks will have an opportunity to get involved in the process and make sure that UPPCO’s done the math right and that pass-through is going to happen.”

The Guardians also disagreed with the notion that electricity rates would drop. Tax credits for wind turbine construction could eat any potential savings. And with almost 70% of UPPCO’s cost occuring in operating and maintaining transmission infrastructure the gains would be minimal the Guardians said.

“As one example DTE Energy now gets almost 10% of their energy from wind (including the Garden Peninsula)” the Guardians said. “However DTE Energy’s customer rates have not decreased.”

After a 9% increase was approved in 2019 DTE made a similar request in 2020; that was ultimately reduced to a 4.7% increase.

The project ran into another hurdle over the summer when the Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) denied Circle Power’s wetlands permit application. EGLE based the decision largely on findings by U.S. Fish & Wildlife which determined the project posed a risk to populations of bald eagle and northern long-eared bat a federally threatened species.

Circle Power has continued discussions with U.S. Fish & Wildlife about the project and plans to reapply for the permit with the revised location Moore said. Biologists have performed more than 1000 hours of surveys on the site.

“We’ve also reduced our wetlands impact with the new layout which we think is good” he said.

In a statement Guardians secretary James Mihelcic doubted the change of the project boundaries would reduce the impact to wildlife. He cited the range of wildlife found on the property which is enrolled in the commercial forest program: raptors moose wolves and grouse. He pointed to a National Audobon Society suit filed against another project in a similar wind corridor in California.

“Mitigation methods are proposed by wind developers to decrease impacts on local wildlife” he said. “However the location still remains a critical area of wildlife congregation.”

Moore said in Circle Power’s view the site is the only viable one for wind projects on the Keweenaw Peninsula. The 60-megawatt wind farm would use up the excess capacity on that transmission system he said.

“There really isn’t room to build any other projects on the Keweenaw Peninsula” he said. “It is not the first of many it’s the first of this is it.”

Moore also responded to concerns about disposal for the turbines after the project ends; Circle Power puts the lifespan of the project at 20 years or possibly longer. About 85% of the turbine can be recycled currently Moore said. Made of fiberglass the blades remain the biggest problem Moore said.

“It’s something that we’re working on but it’s also not something that in the grand scheme of things is a huge problem” he said.

Circle Power’s mailer also included simulated renderings of what the turbines would look like from various vantage points within the township. Six turbines would be visible from the Atlantic Mine substation while none would be seen from South Range Elementary School Jeffers High School or the South Range ballfield. Circle Power sent photos from the sites along with the location of the proposed turbines to a third-party engineering firm Saratoga Associates.

“They’re not going to be invisible” Moore said. “We’re not hiding them or anything like that. But they are going to be back away in the background.”

Adams Township will hold a public hearing on the proposed zoning ordinance at its township hall at 6 p.m. Tuesday. A draft of the ordinance can be found at upadamstownship.com.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYXVkaW9pbmtyYWRpby5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS9oYWxlc3Rvcm0tbHp6eS1oYWxlLW5ldy1hbGJ1bS1pcy1hLWJlYXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Halestorm Vocalist Lzzy Hale Says New Album is a 'Beast',"2021-01-29



Lzzy Hale says making the upcoming new album from Halestorm was “maddening” but in the end it’s a “beast”

It’s already been a while ride for Halestorm this year as the rock band’s tour bus burned down while the band was on tour earlier this month. Thankfully nobody was hurt according to a post on Halestorm’s official Instagram page but it was quite the scare.

In additon Halestorm were ecently forced to cancel their 2022 European “Evening With” tour which was scheduled to set off on Feb. 1 in Frankfurt Germany and run through March 13 in London United Kingdom. The cancelation was “due to the different restrictions in all of the countries” they were going to hit on the trek.

At least Halestorm and their fans have new music to look forward to in 2022. Lead vocalist Lzzy Hale has shared some news about the new album via social media including photos on Instagram of her with guitarist Joe Hottinger showing them celebrating the final mixes of the new set. “I’m so proud of this album. It was the most difficult maddening and rewarding process yet. Y’all ain’t ready for this beast” she stated.

In a separate (Dec. 18) Hale Instagram post Hale showed photo of her listening to the final album after it was fully mixed and mastered. “I’m so grateful to my entire team for their incredible hard work passion and patience” she said. “I’m also grateful for my bandmates that stepped up to make this album magic. I can’t wait to unleash this beast into the world.”

The upcoming Halestorm album will mark some firsts for the band; notably it will be the first time Halestorm uses two producers to make a record. This time around they with Nick Raskulinecz who also produced Halesotrm’s “ReAniMate 3.0: The CoVeRs eP” and “Vicious” as well as the Exies’ Scott Stevens for the vocals. The band also recently scored its sixth No. 1 at rock radio hit with “Back From The Dead.”

SALISBURY — Rowan County saw a light dusting of snow on Friday evening and Saturday morning but by late morning on Saturday roads were largely passable and Duke Energy was reporting zero outages in the county.

The snowfall was light and Rowan County Weather’s Steve Monday estimated about a half-inch fell in the western Rowan community of Atwell. But the storm also marks the third weekend in a row in 2022 there has been some snowfall and freezing temperatures with about 5 inches of total snowfall in January. January 2021 only saw a half-inch and there was no snow in January 2020.

This month has been unusual for the 21st century but Rowan County has recorded snowfalls that massively outpace this year’s total. In 1962 the snowiest January on record was recorded with Salisbury’s two weather stations recording 15.7 and 20.5 inches.

The totals topped a previous large snowfall in March of 1960 and started early in January. On Jan. 2 1962 the Post reported snow ice and fog with temperatures dropping to 25 degrees overnight. Local schools closed and the paper at the time unfortunately described the snow as “too slushy for good sleigh riding” but ideal for snowballing and making snowmen.

“Plenty of these activities were observed” the writer noted.

A week later on Jan. 9 the Post reported receiving three inches overnight with a sunny afternoon the following day. On Jan. 29 the Post reported the largest snowfall since the storm in March 1960 bringing January’s total to more than 15 inches and the fourth snowfall that month. March of 1960 recorded only 9.25 inches of snowfall.

There were a collection of other significant snowfalls in the mid-20th century: 8 inches in two days in January of 1955 8.5 inches in one day in February 1948 and 14 inches in one day in December 1930. Rowan County’s weather stations disagree on whether the years 1960 or 1927 saw the largest snowfall totals but 1927 easily saw the largest snowfall in a single day.

Between March 1 and March 2 1927 20 inches of snow landed on Rowan County. The roof of the local YMCA collapsed. In 1960 a Post writer described it as the yardstick for measuring all other snowfalls in the county. A campaign to bring a YMCA back to Rowan County began in 1955.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uZXdzb2JzZXJ2ZXIvbmFtZS9kZXJlY2stcm9iZXJ0cy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjc2MTA1ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dereck Roberts Obituary (1965 - 2022) - Raleigh NC - The News & Observer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/newsobserver/name/dereck-roberts-obituary?id=32761058 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uZXdzb2JzZXJ2ZXIvbmFtZS9kZXJlY2stcm9iZXJ0cy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjc2MTA1ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50L2FydGljbGUyNTc3ODczOTMuaHRtbNIBS2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLm5ld3NvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50L2FydGljbGUyNTc3ODczOTMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What would a wind farm off the NC coast look like from the beach?

The couple received the award at the CBC’s Annual Dinner.

The Milburns have developed a well-earn reputation for transforming the community by establishing businesses fixing dilapidated buildings and educating children.

“We are humbled to receive this honor. We have worked as a team on projects we completed in the City” said Tony during their acceptance speech. “We are excited to be a part of the amazing renaissance going on in this city.”

Upon receiving the award they modestly credited community associates who head some of their business interests:

Flow Property Management

• The CoWorking Space at Odd Fellows Hall a special events Center they also own

• The Globe named one of the Top 100 Bourbon Bars in the United States

• Community Montessori housed in the historic former Methodist Church at Sixth and Greenup

• The Pickle Factory Boutique Hotel

• and soon to arrive Wenzel Whiskey.

The Founders Award is given annually and usually to an individual who demonstrates meritorious service in improving the economic well-being of Covington. It is handed down in honor of the founders of the Covington Business Council.

CBC Executive Director Pat Frew says it made sense to honor both Tony and Amy Milburn in this case.

“Generating economic vitality is a team sport in Covington. It usually comes in the form of developers working with business tenants and the city to attract commerce in our bustling community. Our Award Committee in this instance wanted to recognize two collaborators who live under the same roof.

“Amy and Tony are synonymous with the word ‘generosity.’ Not just in the funds they provide through their private businesses and the Milburn Family Foundation but in the way they devote their time and talents to all these worthwhile projects which are grounded in the love they share for each other for their family their community born of their commitment to God” Frew concluded.

Dupont 25 stood in as Test skipper for the injured Charles Ollivon during the November series and is set to do so again for the upcoming Six Nations after last playing in December 11’s European Champions Cup win at Cardiff.

The world player of the year is one of five club teammates who were unable to join up with Les Bleus’ pre-tournament camp near Marseille this week after testing positive for the illness.

“We hope everyone will be fit to play this match” Toulouse forwards coach Jean Bouilhou told reporters on Thursday.

“We’re not necessarily counting on them but it lifts your spirits to say that we will be able to count on some of them” he added.

Earlier in the week fashion magazine GQ published an edition with Dupont who led Les Bleus to an impressive win over New Zealand in the autumn on the cover dressed in an oversized yellow designer brand bathrobe.

“I will never prioritise non-sporting things over rugby even if I know it’s part of the game and you have to make the most of it a little bit” Dupont told GQ.

“After the victory over the All Blacks last November we the players had I don’t know how many calls to do things but I was on holiday I rested I did nothing.

“It’s that state of mind that makes you good on the field” he added.

On February 5 Dupont is likely to start at scrum-half in his country’s opening Six Nations game with Italy eyeing a first trophy since 2010.

He is expected to start alongside fellow Toulouse playmaker Romain Ntamack with head coach Fabien Galthie keeping faith with the pair unlike his predecessors.

Galthie’s side host the next Rugby World Cup and have lost just once at home since the former captain took over three years ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNvbGR3aXJlLmNvbS9pcy1kdXBvbnQtc3RpbGwtaW4tYnVzaW5lc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is DuPont Still In Business? (Updated 2023),"DuPont DuPont de Nemours Incorporated has recently been brought back to the attention of the public through Mark Ruffalo’s historical film Dark Waters which follows the story of attorney Robert Bilott and his decades-long legal battle against the major chemical company.

While some parts of the story have been dramatized for the audience DuPont’s track record as a company is astonishing in the worst way.

After viewers learn the dark history of the chemical company the viewers are left wondering how a company could even survive after so many environmental and humanitarian problems.

Is DuPont Still In Business?

Yes DuPont is still in business although it has struggled slightly to survive independently from time to time due to its poor public reputation.

On August 31st of 2017 E. I. Dupont de Nemours Company and the Dow Chemical Company merged as part of a $130 billion merger.

The goal of the merger was to combine two businesses that dabbled in three different chemical industries.

Now the company has 130 brands under the DuPont umbrella including Zytel Vespel GreenVista Duolite and BetaClean.

When you go to the company’s current About Us tab you’ll read about the company’s goals towards keeping waters safe and how it wants to make the modern world more sustainable.

After decades of destroying the environment DuPont has created a Sustainability Strategy.

Their environmentally-friendly strategy can be divided into three categories: innovation adjusting operations and a focus on humanity’s well-being.

DuPont wants to create ideas that help the problems that the planet and the people living on it are struggling with most.

It is also looking to change the way it operates to help improve the safety of its communities and employees.

DuPont also claims that it is putting a larger focus on the health concerns that arise in the communities it is located in and within its own company.

The company seems to be taking environmental concerns such as climate change and water stewardship much more seriously than they have in the past.

DuPont wants to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas it is releasing into the air and also begin to use more renewable energy in its fight against climate change.

This chemical company is now looking to better understand the effect that it has had on water sources and how it can help create cleaner water for the communities that it operates in.

Long History With Unlawful Air Pollution

In the 1970s it was discovered that DuPont’s product Freon was destroying the ozone layer and leading to more people getting skin cancer.

Freon was commonly found in aerosol cans and refrigerants.

The chemical experts at DuPont were found to be downplaying the dangerous nature of chlorofluorocarbons such as Freon.

Despite finding out that its experts had been lying to consumers DuPont didn’t want to stop creating the product because it would have to cut 700000 employees from their jobs.

It wasn’t until a decade later that DuPont would be willing to admit that there was any problem with its product.

Freon would finally be phased out of production by 1988 but the company’s proposed replacements for Freon were just as bad as the original product.

That same year DuPont was taken to court in Oklahoma for violating the Clean Air Act at one of its oil refineries.

The company was forced to pay a $250000 civil penalty and would have to put $1.5 million on pollution controls for the troublesome facility.

In 2003 the company would once again break the Clean Air Act but this time it was for releasing airborne chemicals at its fluoro products plant in Kentucky.

Only two years later DuPont would pay out $2.3 million for Clean Air Act charges in Tennessee after its Tennessee facility was found leaking refrigerants into the air.

In 2007 the company would have to pay $66 million in Clean Air Act penalties for facilities in Ohio Kentucky Virginia and Louisiana.

In this same case it would have to pay an additional $2 million for a chemical plant that the company ran for another company called Lucite.

For generations DuPont would just pay off its mistakes rather than learn from them and continue to pollute the air without a care.

Struggling To Hide Chemical Spillages

DuPont has never been forthcoming about the mistakes that it has made as a company often choosing to hide the mistakes that it made rather than warn the public.

This habit started in 1989 when evidence of its Savannah River nuclear weapons plant having serious structural flaws and health concerns was brought to the public eye.

Although the United States Energy Department tried to say that the company did make the problems known and that it was the government that kept the concerns secret several former officials claim that they were never informed of such problems.

The plant was eventually handed over to Westinghouse later that year.

The 1990s were not looking much brighter for the company which was now dealing with a Benlate spill.

Benlate was a popular fungicide at the time but the spill was such an intense concentration and high amount that it ended up causing widespread plant damage in the farming town surrounding the chemical plant.

The company was hit with hundreds of lawsuits and was forced to pay $500 million in compensation.

DuPont continued to get lawsuits pertaining to the problem it had caused and decided to attempt to fight off the rest.

During these lawsuits evidence that the company had known about the Benlate spill for years came to light.

Instead of costing the company less money than it had hoped Dupont was forced to pay an additional $115 million for concealing evidence.

With the new evidence that had come to light DuPont was responsible for more toxic chemical releases than any other company in the 1980s.

Despite all its legal struggles the company had yet to learn its lesson.

In 2006 Dupont had to pay $1.6 million for the contamination of the wetlands surrounding their DuPont Newport Superfund Site.

Occupational Health And Safety Risks at Dupont

DuPont may have been dealing with environmental problems since the 1970s but it had had problems with occupational health and safety since the 1920s.

Trouble began when eight employees died and hundreds of them were poisoned by tetraethyl lead which was meant for gasoline.

In the 1970s researchers found an alarmingly high number of DuPont employees with bladder cancer.

Since the 1930s there was evidence that beta-naphthylamine caused cancer.

Despite the knowledge available to them for decades DuPont went on to create beta-naphthylamine until 1955 with no care for the health of its workers.

The company then switched to creating benzidine which is another chemical known for causing cancer.

DuPont often knew about problems at its workplace long before it was ever brought to court.

In 1987 there was a New Jersey Superior Court that found there were multiple officials and company doctors that deliberately tried to hide the medical records of six veteran maintenance workers who all had asbestos-related diseases that were linked to their working environment.

That same year DuPont had to pay $11100 as part of a settlement of OSHA charges for similar recordkeeping problems at plants in Dallas Texas and Niagara Falls New York.

In 1999 they would once again get hit with OSHA charges for not keeping proper records.

In this case DuPont had failed to record more than 100 different injuries and illnesses that had occurred at their Seaford location in Delaware.

Only four years prior DuPont had agreed to pay $1.6 in OSHA charges regarding an explosion and fire that occurred at a refinery in Louisiana and killed an employee.

In 2010 an employee was killed when a hose ruptured and released a large quantity of phosgene gas.

Only a year later dangerous conditions led to the death of one of its welders.

Discrimination Against Employees And Applicants

DuPont has a history of not caring for its employees’ well-being but it also has a history of favoring certain types of employees and excluding other potential employees based on things that they have no control over.

The company has gone to some inexcusable lengths in order to find the perfect employees for its needs and remove employees it longer saw as functional.

In the 1980s some New York Times articles by Richard Severo were released about the poor practices of multiple chemical companies with DuPont being at the center of all the corporate controversy.

One way that DuPont chose who it was going to hire was through genetic screening.

Many of the most popular chemical companies had begun testing employees to determine which ones might have a genetic makeup that would make them more susceptible to different toxic chemicals and carcinogens.

Out of all the companies that Severo researched DuPont was the only company to give blood tests to black job applicants in an attempt to see which of them were carriers of the trait that causes sickle-cell anemia.

In 2004 DuPont discriminated against a disabled employee Laura Barrios.

Barrios had a physical disability that affected her ability to walk.

The company claimed that her disability got in the way of her duties and feared that her disability would make it too difficult for her to leave in case of an emergency.

After the court assessed Barrios’s physical capabilities it saw that she would have little to no problem getting out of the building.

If it had been such a concern for the company at the time it could have taken a look at its workplace and made adjustments to make it easier for employees like Barrios to get around.

Barrios was awarded $591000 for the bias case.

Its Attempt To Spread Around The World

During the 1980s DuPont was looking to spread around the globe and wanted to create a plant in Goa India.

DuPont’s history of chemical dumping and spilling had made the company infamous and the local community of Goa wanted nothing to do with the chemical company fearing for the health of the community and its environment.

Although DuPont had heard about the strong opposition that the local community had it began working on the foundation of the plant anyway.

By the 1990s protesters were showing up to the plant site in swarms that made it difficult for construction to continue smoothly.

The plant was going to produce synthetic nylon and had cost the company $217 million to create.

Despite India’s hesitancy to allow foreign companies to build factories in the country DuPont was able to get the plant started with the help of local company Thapar.

The Goa Foundation had filed a writ that stated that the Goa council had gone against the Land Acquisition Act which stated that land was only allowed to be purchased the way that DuPont went about it for public use.

The company had not gotten the necessary legal clearance required for starting a business in the area.

By January 23rd of 1995 tensions between law enforcement and the local activists were becoming higher.

One day a local police officer opened fire on the protesting group and left one protester named Nilesh Naik dead and multiple others injured.

Despite DuPont claiming that they were “shaken up” by the problem it had no plans to stop its Goa expansion at the time.

Eventually DuPont and Thapar were given so much trouble from the Goans that the company decided it would be best to move its operations to Tamil Nadu but it was faced with opposition there too.

Having A Movie Based On One Of Its Scandals

One of the biggest reasons that people are looking back at DuPont as a company is the new Netflix movie Dark Waters which stars Mark Ruffalo as Robert Bilott.

Bilott fought against the chemical company for years despite once working for the company through his law firm.

While some details are in the movie for entertainment purposes only the story of the movie is mostly true.

The only difference between Mark Ruffalo’s performance as Robert Bilott and the real Robert Bilott is that Bilott has never been known to enjoy a celebratory Mai Tai or alcohol in general.

DuPont really did purchase 66 acres of land from Jim Tennant after he came down with a mysterious illness from working at the chemical company for so long.

It then used that plot of land for chemical dumping and silently tested for perfluorooctanoic acid despite knowing what it could do to the human body.

Nearly a decade before the company would deny any culpability and blame the Tennant family for their health problems the company found evidence that the chemical dumping could have a serious effect on the Tennant family their livestock and the local water source.

Robert Bilott was inspired to go against his former employer in court when Wilbur Tennant refused to take the financial compensation for his silence.

Tennant was much more concerned about his local community and loved ones being poisoned than any financial loss or gain.

Although Dark Waters portrays Bilott’s law firm as being angry with the idea of him going up against a former client the firm was actually quite proud of his work despite not always believing that he would come out on top in the cases.

Calmer Waters For DuPont

In the digital age it has become much easier to hold companies like DuPont accountable for their actions.

Many companies like Dupont keep in mind how easy it is for information to spread around the internet and have chosen to be more ethical and transparent to avoid completely ruining their images any further.

DuPont may have a history of polluting the air and waters surrounding its factories it has begun to see the errors in its ways and is looking to change how it does business.

Like most modern companies it has pledged to create a diverse and inclusive workforce.

The company has recently won awards for being named one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality one of America’s Top Corporations for Women’s Business Enterprise and was named to Bloomberg’s Gender-Equality Index of 2020.

Dupont seems to be finally learning from the mistakes it had been making for decades.

Whether it is just to appear better in the public eye or if it truly wants to make amends DuPont isn’t the same company it was when Dark Waters took place.

INDIANAPOLIS — Police say an investigation into a man wanted for an armed robbery led to three arrests and the seizure of a half-pound of methamphetamine as well as a grenade guns and other drugs.

An investigation was opened into Mathew Eaton who IMPD said qualified as a serious violent felon and had an armed robbery warrant.

Detectives were told that Eaton had multiple firearms and a hand grenade that he was threatening to use if he was stopped by police according to IMPD.

The IMPD Southwest District Violence Crimes Task Force and Violence Reduction Team went to Delta Hotel at 5860 Fortune Circle on Jan. 26 to look into an incident where a man identified as Daniel Wade allegedly pointed a gun at hotel employees.

While they were there detectives learned Eaton was in the hotel room with Wade when he reportedly pointed the gun at the employees. However they both had left the hotel prior to officers arriving.

The next day officers found Eaton while he was driving and followed his vehicle. The SWAT team stopped Eaton's vehicle near West Washington Street and Interstate 465.

Eaton Wade and a third suspect Billy Shofner were arrested.

IMPD said officers saw a firearm and what they suspected to be methamphetamine inside the vehicles and searched it.

During the search they found:

Two loaded handguns

One loaded shotgun

One loaded .22 long rifle

A half-pound of methamphetamine

20 grams of fentanyl/heroin

135 grams of spice

20 schedule II pills

Two pill presses

Gun magazines

Ammunition

A grenade (no powder)

$623

IMPD said the vehicle Eaton was driving was also reported stolen.

Eaton was arrested for a robbery warrant as well as possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon dealing methamphetamine possession of methamphetamine and possession of a controlled substance.

Shofner and Wade were arrested for possession of a handgun without a license by a felon dealing methamphetamine possession of methamphetamine and possession of a controlled substance.

IMPD said Wade was also arrested on two domestic battery warrants and for pointing a firearm and intimidation from the incident on the previous day.

Major Matt Thomas applauded the public and IMPD for their help in this case.

“This investigation resulted from information provided by members of our community and the laser-focus IMPD Southwest District officers and detectives have on addressing contributors to violent crime” Thomas said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9kaWFzcG9yYS9hbnRpc2VtaXRpc20vYXJ0aWNsZS02OTUwMjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Neo-Nazi movements thrive in the Digital Age,"International Holocaust Remembrance Day marked last week falls each year on January 27 the day the Red Amy liberated Auschwitz in 1945 and commemorates the 6 million Jews along with countless members of other minorities exterminated by the Nazis and their helpers.

It is our duty to remember but we must also pay heed to the current situation because Nazism is yet to be defeated. Its ideology has endured since Hitler’s fall and until our days now under the rubric of neo-Nazism.

This movement has spread and developed through the years adapting itself in every generation since. Today neo-Nazism acts and spreads primarily through the digital sphere gaining renewed strength.

The world has seen many hate crimes and terrorist attacks carried out by the followers of this ideology. Among the most recent were the Tree of Life – Or L’Simcha Congregation synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in October 2018 the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand in March 2019 and the Poway synagogue shooting in Southern California in April 2019.

All these were carried out by far-right extremists influenced by the fast-growing ideology. Neo-Nazism has existed since shortly after the defeat of the Third Reich. A Nazi-themed anti-vaccination placard is displayed during a demonstration this past week in Brussels against the Belgian government’s restrictions to contain the pandemic. (credit: JOHANNA GERON/REUTERS)

One of the early neo-Nazi groups was founded by George Lincoln Rockwell an American who had served as a US Navy officer in the Battle of the Atlantic against the Germans.

Rockwell founded the World Union of Free Enterprise National Socialists in 1959 and renamed it the American Nazi Party in 1960.

Rick Eaton director of research at the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center and co-director of its Digital Terrorism and Hate Project asked to explain Rockwell’s seemingly contradictory actions responded: “What else would get him so much attention this fast.” Back then Western European countries had laws against these kinds of groups the use of Nazi symbols and racist activities which delayed their resurgence for years Eaton said.

The restrictions loosed up in these countries in the ’70s and ’80s opening the door for neo-Nazi organizations to emerge throughout Europe he continued.

However Nabil Sanaullah communications and press officer at the European Network Against Racism told The Media Line that in Europe the movement’s roots are deeply rooted in the past.

Those roots lie in Europe’s colonial past which was “underpinned by the very same foundation of white supremacy which continues to impact ‘racialized’ communities today” he said.

“When Hitler died his Nazi beliefs did not die with him as the notion of racial superiority is ingrained into our societies” and these white supremacy-ideology groups adopted the German tyrant’s philosophy as it matched their own Sanaullah said.

Neo-Nazi groups are spreading around the world.

Eaton said “You have them in North and South America Europe Australia and South Africa. You even have them in Russia even in a country that suffered so much at the hands of the Nazis.”

Sanaullah added that in countries such as Greece and Hungary neo-Nazi movements have “a strong antisemitic basis of support.”

It is hard to tell how many of these organizations exist and how many supporters the movement has. “What we do know is that nowadays most of the people involved in it are young. The vast majority is probably under 30” Eaton said.

“Sometime around 2017 a whole new generation came along composed of internet-savvy activists who connected through internet sites and communication apps like Telegram and they started attracting younger people to the movement” he added.

Today the phenomenon is rather decentralized.

“These groups tend to argue with each other a lot; everyone wants to be the leader. There are some groups that get together there are some attempts to form alliances there is communication between groups here and in Europe and other places. But there is no organization that is even remotely close to being an umbrella type organization” Eaton said.

Emily Thompson associate director of the research department at the Simon Wiesenthal Center told The Media Line that access to content and the ease of connecting with other people with the same ideology is reaching new heights which bolsters the popularity of these organizations.

“If you’re an individual who is interested in these kinds of groups you will easily find them. And even if you’re not many times it all starts by ‘liking’ a meme or a joke that demeans minorities which could set the ground for a cycle of content encouraging people to think more radically and get influenced by these organizations’ ideology” Thompson said.

“Once you get into groups like these in Telegram there is just an endless stream of far-right and neo-Nazi groups that you can join and then there are more encrypted chat platforms” she added.

“The newest recruitment wave is taking place on the internet. These groups take a lot of time advertising themselves; they make graphic videos and all types of content to try and encourage people to join” Thompson said.

Eaton said the keyboard warriors are highly prized by these groups. “They understand that spreading the message any way you can is good for their movement and ideals” he explained.

Thompson added that most people arrested in the United States for hate crimes had in their possession books or manifestos that promote these ideologies among them Hitler’s Mein Kampf and the late neo-Nazi leader James Mason’s 1992 book Siege.

Mason was an admirer of cult leader Charles Manson and an ideologue for the Atomwaffen Division neo-Nazi terrorist organization.

Thompson said that through Telegram and other digital platforms these groups “share manuals for explosives manufacture ways to get weapons defense tactics and shooting tutorials.”

Eaton noted that these organizations have managed to survive many obstacles as they adapt rapidly to new situations and tailor their messages to exploit current issues.

“Neo-Nazis are very resilient; they will use whatever issue is confronting the region where they are located. So if it’s immigration if it’s crime drug dealing or any other matter they are very good at refocusing wherever there is an issue that will resonate with the people that they are trying to reach” he said.

In Europe for instance Sanaullah explained that neo-Nazi movements are “setting the tone of the debate on immigration particularly related to Muslim migrants.”

The experts added that many governments especially in North America and Western Europe are taking the threat very seriously.

In the United States for instance there are initiatives promoted by the Justice Department where programs have been created to deal with online extremism Eaton said. And some of the most dangerous groups such as the US-based Atomwaffen Division also known as the National Socialist Order have been nearly dismantled by imprisoning many of its members for committing hate crimes.

Sanaullah noted that in Europe there is a political commitment from the institutions of the EU to tackle all forms of hate speech and hatred crimes that can be used as tactics of oppression by far-right groups. “In various efforts the European Commission has developed few policies and targeted actions to prevent and counter right-wing extremism.”

This is not the case in Eastern Europe Eaton pointed out.

“I feel that when you have a right-wing government they don’t want to be seen as cracking down too hard on the extreme right unless they really get out of hand and then they are forced to do something. Certainly in Hungary and Poland they are allowing things to go on because in many ways they are part of it” Eaton said for example in their opposition to immigration.

“Unfortunately some mainstream political parties often legitimize racist and xenophobic discourses put forward by far-right and neo-fascist groups instead of strongly rejecting them” Sanaullah added.

The Wiesenthal Center experts suggested that the real solution lies in education parental responsibility and social activities.

Many people recruited by neo-Nazis feel isolated and are looking for a place to belong Thompson explained.

“I think society needs to make sure that these needs are met in good ways so that these people are not driven to turn to these organizations to satisfy their social needs” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5cmFjdXNlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDEvNzM4MDAwLWhvbWUtaW4tc3lyYWN1c2Utc2VlLTE0Ni1ob21lLXNhbGVzLWluLW9ub25kYWdhLWNvdW50eS5odG1s0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3lyYWN1c2UuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMS83MzgwMDAtaG9tZS1pbi1zeXJhY3VzZS1zZWUtMTQ2LWhvbWUtc2FsZXMtaW4tb25vbmRhZ2EtY291bnR5Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$738000 home in Syracuse: See 146 home sales in Onondaga County,"Here are 146 home sales in Onondaga County recorded between January 17 and January 21 at the county clerk’s office.

A new team in Salford have today launched their operation to tackle ‘cuckooing’ in the city following the murder of Leigh Smith.

Cuckooing is a practice whereby criminal gangs take over a vulnerable person’s home in order to sell or store drugs.

Leigh Smith was one such victim of the ‘brutal’ practice after he was stabbed to death in Eccles in June 2021.

READ MORE: The staggering drugs empire of £7000 a week cuckooing gang led by 17-year-old gangster turned murderer

His teenage killers Jacob Cookson age 18 and 17-year-old Logan Eaton were sentenced yesterday.

Cookson will serve at least 19 years behind bars with Eaton facing a minimum 17-year stretch.

Now after the murder of the 48-year-old dad Salford Connect is tackling cuckooing head-on — with police appealing for information from potential victims and their neighbours to find more people in need.

The team is a partnership dedicated to protecting those at risk of criminal exploitation with agencies from the police Salford City Council and the NHS.

Already 12 people have been supported under the Operation Firestop banner.

(Image: GMP)

It has allowed those to start life afresh outside of the city after speaking out about their fear and anxieties about the conditions they were subjected to.

Offenders typically would coerce their victims into allowing them in their homes before gradually taking it over.

(Image: GMP)

Cuckooing victims also usually are subjected to violence intimidation and abuse.

Detective Superintendent Chris Packer Salford's lead for safeguarding and vulnerability said: ""Salford Connect is a really important multi-agency response to the issues of criminal exploitation in the city as we are working with a range of different partners to understand how to identify the signs of this type of criminality and how we can best support vulnerable people who may be victims of it.

""The tragic death of Leigh Smith really brought to the surface how brutal and ultimately fatal cuckooing can be and through Operation Firestop we have already been able to identify 12 people who were being preyed upon due to their vulnerabilities that we have now successfully safeguarded and been given the chance to turn their lives around elsewhere outside of Salford.

(Image: GMP)

""When it's happening it may appear to neighbours to sound like a disturbance or nuisance in the community; but actually when groups of people are routinely gathered in stairwells or causing unwanted noise in a block of flats it's possible that what is actually going on is cuckooing and that a vulnerable person's property is being targeted by drug dealers and criminal exploiters.

""This causes those targeted to feel intimidated uncomfortable and scared and we know that they may find it difficult to come forward as victims are often drug users exploited by dealers; however those that are preyed upon should know we understand how awful this crime is we understand their vulnerabilities and we understand they are victims - we will support you.""

Anyone with information or concerns should contact police online - if able - via www.gmp.police.uk or call 101. Always call 999 in an emergency.

Details can be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

EBAY,eBay,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL3NlbGxpbmctdW5pdGVkLXVwZ3JhZGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Idiocy: Selling United Airlines Business Class Upgrades On eBay…,"A word of wisdom: don’t sell your United Airlines PlusPoints (upgrades). Don’t buy them either. It’s one of the quickest ways to ensure your MileagePlus account will be shut down and your status and miles forfeited. One chef may be about to learn this the hard way.

The Lunacy Of Selling (And Buying) United Airlines Upgrades On eBay

I search for travel-related items on eBay from time to time and a few days ago a sponsored listing popped up in my feed: $440 for 40 Plus Points.

With some amusement I clicked through. I’ve seen listings like this for years: its always the same: a 1K or Global Services members selling “advice” on upgrades then giving you the upgrade for “free.” He’s even willing to cut his “consulting fee” in half for domestic flights where half the number of PlusPoints are required in order to upgrade a flight.

Not that ignorance is a defense when it comes to United Airlines shutting down accounts for bartering or selling upgrades but when sellers play this “advice” game it means they know that it is against MileagePlus program rules to sell upgrades.

And yet they do it.

But this particular listing takes it a step even further. The seller even includes his own website on the eBay listing and invites you to text him with questions.

Chef J you look like a nice guy but you’re making a huge mistake…

And so are you reader if you even think about buying upgrades from him or any other seller on eBay or Craigslist.

Chef J warns you “When dealing with United if they ask you can say that you are getting an upgrade from a friend.”

(emphasis his)

But if United determines that a Premier member is selling miles or upgrades it will not only cancel the account of the seller it might very well close yours too and void your open ticket(s). At the very least it will take away your upgrades.

So be wise: don’t buy upgrades on eBay.

And it shocks me this guy has not been caught. It’s so blatant and it has obviously gone on for years since the guy refers to these as “GPUs” in one part of his listing (United switched from Global Premier Upgrades to PlusPoints in 2019).

CONCLUSION

As it turns out for those who would really want to own the top-of-the-line Lucid Air not all is lost as basically new cars are available on eBay.

We found three cars all of which start at well over $200000 which is significantly more than the MSRP of $169000.

Let's take a look:

""The Dream edition was fully sold out and you cannot buy a new one. I had reserved my car in 2020 and finally got it only 2 weeks ago.

""I am offering an extremely rare 2022 Lucid Air Dream Edition 1111 HP performance model. This is number #240 of about 300 currently in the world and #240 of 520 that will EVER be produced.

That's pretty interesting. So far we have not seen the Range version of the Dream Edition on eBay - all three listed above are Performance versions.

Lucid is expected to start customer deliveries of the more regular Grand Touring version of the Air model very soon. It will start at an MSRP of $139000 and offer similar range. Acceleration will be a bit slower but still brisk quick.

Well that didn't take long. Lucid's first Air Dream Edition customer deliveries kicked off on October 30th 2021 with the inaugural Lucid Rally and now the 1111 horsepower luxury EVs are starting to pop up for sale online. There are four Dream Editions currently available to purchase on eBay Motors. The cheapest is offered for $35k over MSRP while the most expensive adds a $70000 premium to the DE's $169000 manufacturer price. They all have low mileage but some more than others.

$206000

This one comes with the Dream Edition-exclusive Eureka Gold paint and 21-inch Aero wheels. It's the Performance model so range is ""only"" 471 miles rather than the Range edition's headline 520 miles and it's fitted with the Santa Monica interior. The ad doesn't mention whether the Air is being stored or driven until it makes its way to its next owner but it's located in Oregon.

$210000

This one's for sale in Orlando and has approximately 700 miles on the clock. Unique among this earliest selection of second-hand Dream Editions the seller says that they're currently driving the car and that mileage will increase the longer the ad is up. It's car #111 off the production line with Eureka Gold paint and the 21-inch Aero wheels which are exclusive to the Dream Edition. The current owner says that they're ""thoroughly enjoying it and not looking for a quick/desperate sale"" and highlights the Air's rapid charging speed in their ad.

$225000

This Air Dream Edition is #34 off the production line and is located in Oklahoma. Like the previous cars it comes in Eureka Gold with the 21-inch Aero wheels. It also has the Santa Monica interior package and has just been treated to a clear bra window tinting and ceramic paint protection coating. Like the other cars on this list it's a Performance edition with 471 miles of range.

$239000

Yours for MSRP plus $70000 Dream Edition #240 is unique as the only car here presented with Stellar White paint. Like the others it's a Performance edition with the 21-inch wheels but unlike the others it has very low miles (just 17) if in fact it's been driven at all since delivery. This seller's really on their game touting the fact that the Dream Edition has been sold out for months and your only hope of getting one at this point is the second hand market. It's got the Santa Monica interior and the ad was posted the same day that it was delivered to its current caretaker. Intended to be flipped for maximum profit from the get-go it has all the carpet seat and screen covers used during shipping still in place. A Stellar White Dream Edition recently popped up at Ford's Dearborn Michigan facility and this could be that car.

The British Veterinary Association wrote to Ebay and Etsy after they discovered the cruel kits available for sale from international retailers.

The BVA has been running a campaign to outlaw the practice and to educate pet owners that cropping or straightening the ears of their pets is cruel.

The British Veterinary Association has been running a campaign to stop the sale of DIY dog ear cropping kits as the procedure is painful for the animal and entirely unnecessary

BVA President Justine Shotton wrote the letter to express her members' concerns 'about the easy availability of ear straightening or correcting accessories'.

Dr Shotton said: 'We took action after being made aware by a few vets about the availability of ear cropping kits on eBay UK. Our research also found a number of listings for ear straightening accessories being sold via several other major online websites.

'The swift and positive action by the two major retailers is a small but significant animal welfare win for our #CutTheCrop campaign.

'While the Government has promised action to close the legal loophole that allows cropped dogs to be brought into the country from abroad the availability of such accessories online remains hard to tackle.'"

(January 29th),"Team of the Week

Our Pick: Akanji (Dortmund — CB — 85)

SBCs

Objectives and Misc.

Welcome to the Locker Room. Here we can talk about all of FIFA 22 's Ultimate Team mode news once a week. That includes a list of the Team of the Week cards including our chosen pick as well as the newest SBCs and the objectives for the week.It is quite the 19th week in the world of Ultimate Team. Big cards just keep rolling out and there is plenty of good value to be had either on the market or in the objective players that are starting to drop. The team of the week is nice and clean with Kimmich and Varatti being the stand out pair. The former a Bayern Munich CDM has dominant technical ability as well as high defensive numbers. It is actually a bit of an odd card in that it's hard to pin down how to use him but I would actually suggest bumping him into CM as a slow possession moving box-to-box player or a Tarquista. Putting someone like Zakaria just behind him and pairing Kimmich with a leaner and faster CM someone like Nkunku or NumbersUp Reyna will help keep him balanced. He obviously has a Headliners card that is a step above but it is also double the price. Veratti is a much simpler card to deal with because he doesn't have the physicality to tempt you into putting him into CDM. Keep him in a central position and just let his technical qualities shine by ensuring the rest of your midfield is balanced.The Featured Player this week is also our pick of the week. Akanji is also another Bundesliga centre-back after last weeks pick of St. Juste. On the plus side though you could pair the two together to make a nearly unbeatable combination. Akanji has enough in those three key departments — pace physicality and defending — that an Anchor chemistry style basically gives him mid-90s. There isn't much more to say other than the fact he has surprisingly good dribbling and to watch out for his relatively small 6'2"" stature.We have picked the currently available SBCs and priced them as per FUTbin 's amazing listings. Varane has this 92-rated Flashback card that is nearly a million coins. If you have the money though I mean nothing is stopping you from doing this is it? He has long been one of the best centre-backs in FIFA so this card is no different with great stats in every crevice. While for many the excitement will be about Varane for us it is all about Dest  the Barcelona RB. He might not be with the Catalans for too long but this 88-rated card will forever live on. It's about 100k but holy moly it is worth so much more. Pace power good defensive numbers good passing. This card has to be the first on your agenda particularly seeing as he can reach 93-rated with the right chemistry styles.The Silver Star is Gerrit Holtman . To earn him you have to get six assists eight goals and three wins in the Silver Lounge FUT friendly. Seria A team Venezia's right-winger Verde has a pretty splendid 97-rated card that requires you to head to the TOTY friendly and play a few games. You must score in 11 separate matches with four-star skilled players score a volley win four and score three using Serie A players.

Let us know your pick outs! Is anybody taking your fancy? Agree with our Player Pick from the TOTW?

Credited with shaping the modern-day pop scene Australia has served as the port for a number of artists who have pushed the boundaries of rock. Melbourne has swiftly become the hot spot for budding musicians to prosper and grow as an artistic community. Better still many of them have been women.

In recent years Melbourne has grown into something bubblier and more eclectic swiftly becoming the cosmopolitan hubbub where society and singularity go hand in hand. In other words it has become the Australian Dublin or Manchester depending on how you look at it. Priding itself on diversity and integrity the city has fashioned a newer trendier voice for artists to go behind.

Take Julia Jacklin for instance a burgeoning songwriter determined to fashion a new lexicon from an art-craft that stems as much from her personal life experience as it does from her personal geography. Her music is sombre and cerebral much as Courtney Barnett‘s is raw rollicking and frequently vivid.

Indeed Barnett was happy to welcome the title of raucous rock and roller not least because it gives her a chance to plug in her guitar and wail. “I love playing loud and aggressive and disjointed music” Barnett noted adding: “And I love that songs can have different lives. So I’m sure they’ll get a bit faster get a bit more energy get a bit more raucous. But what I wanted the recorded version to sound like was keeping in check with that sense of calmness”.

Other female voices that have begun to emerge include Stella Donnelly Camp Cope Sarah Blasko all of whom can stand proudly beside Melbourne favourite Kylie Minogue. Pencilled by many as the live music capital of Australia the city holds a number of live venues many of them enigmatic but all of them distinctive.

The Cherry Bar certainly made an impression on Noel Gallagher who considered purchasing the place before praising blues exports Jet. “I’m glad Jet are from Melbourne — it would have been shit if they were from Sydney because I don’t really like Sydney that much” the Oasis guitarist said. “There’s a very nice harbour but a certain lack of soul about it. I’d rather live here”.

And then there’s Heartbreaker another trendy bar that focuses on the guitar riff ahead of the grooves commonly heard on the dance floor. For those aching for a more electronic fused outlet Beneath Driver Lane offers an alternative avenue from which audience members can let their hair down and dance.

The Carlton Club has decided to go all out and embrace the opportunity of an all-female lineup for their first-ever live event. Solo electronic artist Kids At Midnight will curate an event the Love Safari an show at The Carlton Club that will see the likes of The Girl Fridas Aurelia Roz Yuen and Kids At Midnight. The dissertation of this particular event is that it will celebrate the best of female artists the country has to offer.

Australian singer-songwriter Sarah Blasko is swiftly emerging as one of the more interesting electronic-pop artists of her generation but like many others before her it’s art led by heart not commerce. “I haven’t had any real training” she modestly said.“Just life the training of life. I’ve been doing it for a while. I’m old. And I love performing live. That’s actually my favourite part of playing music. I love recording but performing is where I started. I didn’t do a lot of my own recording to begin with—I just got up on stage and performed. It’s what I fell in love with”.

She won’t be the only one falling in love with life or Melbourne by the sounds of things. And the city should be applauded for everything it is doing to encourage more women to take out their guitars and sing. Art must be measured on its propensity to be enjoyed yet it should also be measured based on the vitality of its foundations. What it holds in stature has been rewarded by the variety of acts in its grasp. Dublin brought guitar bands U2 and The Frames into the conversation Manchester gifted the world a convoy of esoteric groups like 10cc and Buzzcocks and now Melbourne looks like it will be continuing the narrative to the next logical step pop is determined to take. Fittingly the majority of the acts seem to be women.

The city certainly helped Gotye to find his natural voice as an artist. Reflecting on his success he denied using a formula to gain incredible success: “There are so many great songs—some of which get the attention in the pop sphere and some of which are only heard by a small number of people. It’s not a perfect song by any means; I don’t think there is a perfect song.”

He’s referring of course to ‘Somebody That I Used To Know’ a choppy indie song that many derived as a Sting composition when they first heard it. The song was released ten years ago at a time when indie was dominated by males alone. Back then the role of a female singer was to play the role of a jilted lover as was heard in the Gotye epic.

But Barnett and Blasko have shown that women are more than capable of writing cutting-edge pop laced with attitude and adrenaline. It’s thanks to Melbourne music pouring from the stages and back onto the streets. Speculating on how the city will evolve is bound to be pointless but given the sincerity of the music the diversity of the acts and best of all for the quality of the work.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZS9saWZlc3R5bGUvaG93LWlyZWxhbmRzLWdyb3dpbmctZXNwb3J0cy1zY2VuZS1pcy1idWlsZGluZy1hLWxhc3RpbmctbGVnYWN5LTEyNDg4MjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Ireland's growing Esports scene is building a lasting legacy,"Ireland is not only a hot bed for gamers but also home to some of the biggest gaming publishers in the world.

Electronic Arts (EA) have a studio in Galway while Riot Games and Activision/Blizzard both have studios in Dublin.

The consumer market in Ireland has always been strong but the competitive side of gaming has been slower to develop here. The United States South Korea China Sweden and Denmark all lead the way. However Ireland has been making strides to change that in recent years.

Trevor Keane co-founder of Epic Global Agency told BreakingNews.ie: ""Ireland is a growing market if you look at the last few years we have gone from a grassroots scene to now having teams like Munster Rugby Gaming (MRG) and Nativz based in Dublin who both compete in League of Legends.""

Epic Global Agency helps Esport players get their foot in the door as well as create commercial strategies for teams.

Having infrastructure in place which fosters talent is crucial and sadly that is one of the main areas where Ireland is falling behind.

“We are trying to create a pathway for Irish gamers. We are looking to do an Irish league based on Valorant which would then feed into the UK league.

“That is what needs to happen more and more create the infrastructure in Ireland that will feed into other ecosystems"" he says.

There are around two million gamers in Ireland across all spectrums and it is estimated there around 700000 Esports enthusiasts.

Another issue which Keane highlights is the lack of coverage of Esports in general compared to other sports.

""We haven't seen the same coverage of Esports in the national media like you would with other teams. You don't see Irish players or teams on the news when they win.

Academy systems

""In the UK you have the likes of The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (Ukie) who are a gaming body and you have Digital Schoolhouse which is a pathway into the sport.""

Esports is closely linked to STEM learning in the UK so people are exposed to it at a very young age. Gaming can often be a tool to help people learn skills such as teamwork and communication.

While rugby and soccer have academy systems to nurture young talent Esports is no different and while individuals can succeed on their own having those systems in place will help Irish Esports in the long run.

That was something Enda Lynch head of enterprise at Munster rugby was aware of when he decided set up an Esports team as a way to expand the Munster brand.

The idea stemmed from needing to create other revenue streams beyond just success on the rugby pitch or ticket sales. After going to a network event in the US with major sporting brands like the News York Mets and Yankees the idea of an Esports team came about.

""I came back from that event enthused and I started looking into our own data. It is the same for all live sports TV audiences are ageing and younger people digest sport very differently.

""We wanted to add longevity to the brand and try and capture a younger more tech-savvy demographic.""

The question was what game to focus on? But also how to build a team? They settled on the most popular Esports game League of Legends which is as a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game.

Teams of five face off against each other to earn kills and take over the other teams base.

While some of the biggest sporting brands like PSG and Barcelona have pumped money into their Esports teams Lynch was aware that to get the respect of gamers you need to earn your stripes.

""We set the team up during the pandemic and we said we are not going to come in with money overnight that Munster don't have. We have to graduate up through the leagues and gradually build our sponsorship and commercial base.""

The ultimate goal for MRG is to have a residential programme where they have their players on a campus like they would with their rugby team.

The 2 Johnnies playing with Munster Rugby Gaming

Due to Covid-19 they have had to slow down their plans but it played into an approach of building up their team and fanbase at a steady rate.

They compete in the Northern League of Legends Championship (NLC) which consists of teams from the UK Ireland Denmark Finland Norway Sweden and Iceland.

Organic growth

While others teams have come and gone from buying their way into Division 1 and not setting a foundation MRG made a conscious decision to stay in Division 2 and build organically.

As Lynch put it:

We are not in it for the boom or bust we have commitments to player salaries and we want to do things the right way.

One of the most important elements of Esports beyond pure skill is the mental component. Players are competing as a team with a huge amount of pressure on them.

MRG brought on board Esports psychologist Kate O'Keefe who has worked with some of the best League of Legends players in the world.

One of the bigger issues in competitive gaming is what is known as 'titling' where a player goes off script when things go wrong and it negatively effects their performance and their teams.

""Already we have identified two players that have issues taking feedback and she is working on that with them. It fits into our ethos as we want all players that come to us to leave better players"" he says.

Even though they are keen on branching out to other games Lynch says they are a ""family-friendly"" brand and stray away from first-person shooter games like Call of Duty or Valorant which have more toxic communities.

As Lynch says: ""We have had players in the past that didn't fit with our ethos so we didn't renew their contract. It is that simple.""

A screenshot of MRG playing League of Legends

Their team itself is a melting pot with a mix of nationalities and personalities. As Lynch says: ""We have our lead player Ronan 'Chemera' Stewart and he is the highest rated player playing under the Irish flag.

Communication can be difficult with some many nationalities but having a player and coach from the same country mean they can bounce off each other if they hit a roadblock.

Unlike other realistic titles like PUBG the title is known for its cartoonish graphics and fast-paced gameplay.

Having said that the start of Season 11 in November introduced the largest map in the game to date called Storm Point.

Players have been drooling over how good it looks and runs compared to maps like World’s Edge and Kings Canyon.

According to Apex Legends principal designer Rodney Reece the tropical island of Storm Point is designed to ‘address bad third-party encounters optimal loot flow and combat engagement for a better gameplay experience’.

But now Apex Legends players are expressing (12345678910) their disappointment with Storm Point saying that the new map feels empty and boring and that there are no good points of interest.

way too much open space building designs are bad too many open floor plans without enough interior features to break line of site/force CQC engagements loot too spread out wildlife is HORRIBLE you either have to avoid entire sections of the map just because the damn prowlers or spiders will attack you and make you waste ammo/giver away your position or you move through that area and waste ammo and give away your position.

Its so unbelievably * boring… 3rd partying is worse than ever due to the increased number of POIs leading to fewer squad wipes upon landing. Camping is worse in the final ring. The ring in general got upgraded from minor raid boss to major raid boss.. its seriously just run run run run see team kill team die immediately to third party. If that third party doesn’t kill you don’t worry there will be more. I’ve never had so many teams show up to a single location simultaneously on any other map. One of course.. its why many hate this game.. Two.. sometimes but 3 or 4? How is that even happening?

Many say that the map is simply too big for 20 squads and that EA should add more players to the round to retain the fast-paced gameplay Apex Legends is known for.

Even some Pro players feel the same. Here is what a Twitch streamer known as ImperialHal has to say.

I like the map but at the same point I don’t” he confesses. “In terms of loot it feels fine but the areas of the map feel uneven. There are just a lot of spots on the map where it’s like hard… there’s a lot of power positions on this map compared to other positions that are just dogs**t compared to it.

We hope EA listens to its player base and makes some changes to Storm Point so it does not feel empty or boring for Apex Legends players.

In the meantime do let us know if you find Storm Point interesting or boring in the comment section down below.

The peptide is a lifesaving drug for people with type 1 diabetes and it can improve the health of people with type 2 diabetes. In the century since it was first used as a therapy researchers have learned much about how insulin works developed processes for making large quantities of it and engineered analogs that work faster or for longer periods. As insulin embarks on its second century researchers continue to find ways to improve its performance. Read on to learn about innovations such as glucose-responsive insulin which can keep blood sugar in check and reduce the risk of hypoglycemic episodes.

Before the discovery of insulin type 1 diabetes was a death sentence. That prognosis started to change on Jan. 11 1922 when 14-year-old Leonard Thompson became the first person with diabetes to receive an injection of a pancreatic extract from dogs. We now know that extract contained insulin.

That first extract wasn’t very pure so although Leonard’s blood sugar decreased the overall effect was disappointing. About 2 weeks later Leonard received an injection of a purer extract and the results were more promising. That same month six other people with diabetes also received injections that reduced their blood sugar levels. Those trials at the University of Toronto marked the beginning of a lifesaving treatment for type 1 diabetes.

In the 100 years since Leonard received his first dose insulin has become well known. Scientists purified identified and characterized the peptide; elucidated its role in glucose metabolism; developed biotechnology processes for producing large quantities of it; and engineered analogs that can work faster or for longer periods.

Yet even with all these advances academic and industry researchers continue to look for ways to improve insulin and thus improve outcomes for people with diabetes. “There is as much to be done chemically with insulin today as there’s ever been in its history” says Richard D. DiMarchi a chemistry professor at Indiana University Bloomington who was previously a vice president at Eli Lilly and Company and Novo Nordisk two of the three major producers of insulin. “While this is a miraculous substance it is an imperfect and one might say lousy drug by conventional standards.”

Researchers especially want to develop insulin that can turn itself on and off in response to glucose in the blood. That glucose responsiveness can be imparted by formulating the insulin with materials engineered to release it in proportion to the amount of glucose or through modifications to the insulin itself.

Insulin Timeline

Insulin basics

Insulin is a peptide hormone that regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates fats and proteins. β Cells in the pancreas secrete insulin in response to glucose in the blood. Insulin which has an A chain and a B chain held together by disulfide bonds exists in an equilibrium of monomers dimers trimers hexamers and dodecamers says Michael A. Weiss an insulin expert at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Whereas the main storage form of insulin in β cells and in most drug formulations is a hexamer coordinated with zinc the active form in the blood is the monomer.

Insulin’s binding to its receptor on the surface of cells initiates a signaling cascade that results in the insertion of glucose transporters into cell membranes so that they import glucose. Recent cryo-electron microscopy structures show that as many as four insulin molecules bind to the insulin receptor dimer (eLife 2019 DOI: 10.7554/eLife.48630). Multiple insulin molecules trigger a large conformational change in the insulin receptor and stabilize the active conformation to initiate downstream signaling says Eunhee Choi a cell biologist at Columbia University who was part of the team that acquired the structures.

Diabetes is a metabolic disease in which the body either no longer makes insulin or can’t properly use the insulin that it does make. In type 1 diabetes the body destroys β cells in the pancreas so it doesn’t produce insulin. In type 2 diabetes the pancreas still makes insulin but cells develop resistance to it. All people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin. Many people with type 2 diabetes also need insulin.

What makes insulin a “lousy drug” is its narrow therapeutic index. The therapeutic index is the difference between an effective dose and a toxic dose—and in the case of insulin either too much or too little can be dangerous. If a person takes too little insulin they don’t metabolize glucose effectively. That can lead to long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease nerve damage and kidney damage. But if they take too much insulin they run the risk of hypoglycemia an emergency condition that can lead to coma and death if not reversed in time.

“When you talk to a lot of diabetics they’ll choose to keep their blood glucose higher than would be ideal because of how scary hypo events are” says Matthew Webber a biomedical engineer at the University of Notre Dame who’s working on materials to improve insulin delivery. “They’re making a gamble that they’d rather have cardiovascular disease and risk of stroke and other sorts of things in 20 years than have a hypo event tonight.”

Companies have developed insulin analogs that work faster or last longer than natural human insulin. These changes are achieved by modifying the amino acid sequence or by attaching side chains. But none of these analogs is perfect.

“There’s clearly room for improvement because every insulin that’s marketed today is capable of inflicting a life-threatening hypoglycemic event” DiMarchi says. He was involved in the discovery and development of the first approved insulin analog lispro which acts more quickly than native insulin and is marketed by Lilly under the brand name Humalog.

Faster and slower

Insulin is typically injected into the fatty tissue under the skin. Before it can start working it needs to get from there to the bloodstream. Even rapid-acting insulin takes about 15 min to start working and continues to work for 3–4 hours after administration says Eric Appel a materials scientist at Stanford University who’s working on ways to get insulin to act faster and turn off more quickly.

One challenge to speeding up insulin response times is that insulin has to dissociate from hexamers to monomers its active form.

Although monomeric insulin would be absorbed quickly it is too unstable for direct use as a drug. “You simply cannot make a drug product of it and ship it around the world” Appel says. The insulin molecule has a disordered portion that predisposes the peptide to aggregate into amyloid fibrils. In the hexameric form the floppy bits that initiate aggregation are sequestered. “It has to be formulated as a hexamer but the dissociation of the hexamer is what makes it so slow” to act he says.

Appel wants to eliminate the dissociation step by stabilizing monomeric insulin in the vial. “As much as protein stability sounds boring in this particular case it’s an example where it is absolutely the challenge that keeps drugs from working as well as they could” he says.

He has identified a polymeric additive that prevents aggregation by blocking protein adsorption to interfaces such as the air glass rubber and plastic in vials pen injectors or pump systems. The interfaces become an even bigger problem if the vial or delivery device is shaken because the interfaces keep breaking up and re-forming. Because the additive doesn’t interact specifically with the protein it can be used for any protein therapeutic Appel says.

He has started a company called Surf Bio to commercialize the new additive. The company has started nonclinical toxicology studies. Appel expects it will take 5 years to get through Phase 3 trials and fully commercialize the new ultrafast monomeric insulin drug candidate and the additive that enables it.

Indiana University’s Weiss is also working on ways to stabilize insulin against amyloid formation. To do that his team is exploring ways to make heat-stable insulins in which the A and B chains are covalently connected by short peptide linkers.

The tether needs to be long enough to allow receptor binding but too short to allow for amyloid formation which requires a conformational change in the insulin according to Weiss. “You can make active insulin molecules that are totally refractory to forming amyloid—even if you boil them” he says.

Weiss founded the company Thermalin more than a decade ago to develop novel insulin molecules such as the heat-stable ones and others that are optimized to enable the miniaturization of devices for the automated delivery of insulin.

Longer-lasting insulins are also under development. Novo Nordisk and Lilly are working on slow-acting insulins that could be taken once a week. Such products also called basal insulins could be used in combination with a mealtime insulin by people with type 1 diabetes or on its own by people with type 2 diabetes.

Novo Nordisk’s weekly insulin called icodec is in Phase 3 clinical trials according to Peter Kurtzhals the firm’s chief scientific adviser. Icodec has three substitutions in insulin’s amino acid sequence and a 20-carbon fatty diacid side chain. The backbone substitutions reduce the rate that cells take up insulin. The fatty diacid gives icodec a strong affinity for albumin which increases the time the insulin spends in circulation. Icodec has a circulating half-life of nearly a week Kurtzhals says.

Lilly’s once-weekly insulin is a single-chain variant—meaning the A and B chains are connected by a covalent tether—linked to part of a human antibody says Ruth Gimeno vice president for diabetes research and clinical investigation at Lilly. It has a circulating half-life of 17 days and the concentration in serum varies by only 10% which gives people added flexibility in when they take each dose. It’s intended for people with type 2 diabetes.

An insulin that can be taken once weekly will encourage people with type 2 diabetes to adopt insulin therapy earlier and to stick to it leading to better outcomes Gimeno said at Lilly’s investor community meeting in December.

Self-activating

One of the best ways to avoid hypoglycemic events would be to develop insulins that can respond to glucose. Researchers are taking multiple approaches to create such designer insulins.

One approach is to encapsulate insulin in glucose-responsive materials. These insulin storage depots have the advantage of lasting for a long time says Danny Hung-Chieh Chou of Stanford University who is working on various forms of glucose-responsive insulin.

You have to do some advanced chemistry to equip the insulin molecule with those chemical features. Peter Kurtzhals chief scientific adviser Novo Nordisk

Another advantage of depots is that they can incorporate any already-approved insulin analog which could ease the approval process Webber says. But the insulin is also only a fraction of the material in the formulation. “That raises costs and causes all kinds of other potential pitfalls in terms of manufacturing” he says. Plus once the insulin is released from the depot there’s no way to get it back so a person can still become hypoglycemic.

Zhen Gu a materials scientist at Zhejiang University and his coworkers are developing a glucose-responsive microneedle patch that can deliver insulin across the skin. Insulin and phenylboronic acid are embedded in the polymeric microneedles. When glucose forms a complex with the phenylboronic acid the microneedles swell and release the insulin. Gu and his colleagues have used such patches to control blood glucose levels in diabetic minipigs (Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2020 DOI: 10.1038/s41551-019-0508-y). A patch about the size of a coin can control the blood glucose of a 25 kg minipig for about a day Gu says.

Gu believes that the patch could ease some of the timing constraints around insulin injections. People with diabetes must inject themselves before meals—and then eat soon enough to prevent hypoglycemia. People would still apply Gu’s patch before meals but they would have more flexibility in the timing of the meals. He and his colleagues have started a company called Zenomics to develop and commercialize the patches.

The second general approach to creating glucose-responsive insulins is to add a glucose-sensing moiety directly to insulin. This has proved to be challenging but researchers are optimistic that it will eventually work.

Chou is trying to impart glucose responsiveness by inducing conformational changes in insulin through a combination of amino acid changes and chemical modifications. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reported in the past few years show that insulin changes conformation when it binds to the insulin receptor Chou says. Glucose responsiveness could be achieved by switching between conformations that bind more strongly or weakly to the insulin receptor. Initially Chou says researchers would focus on creating linear responses to changes in glucose levels. But to better mimic the pancreas’s activity insulin would respond nonlinearly Chou says.

Merck & Co. had a glucose-responsive insulin reach Phase 1 clinical trials. Merck acquired this program when it bought SmartCells which explored the concept of adding saccharide units that bind to the mannose receptor. Merck developed the compound that reached the clinic. The molecule can be removed from the blood via a mechanism that doesn’t involve activating the insulin receptor and driving glucose levels too low. When glucose levels are low insulin that might otherwise induce hypoglycemia is cleared through the mannose receptor. And the lower that glucose levels get the faster that the mannose pathway works.

“We really thought that the big unmet need was to open up the therapeutic index which is not as readily addressable by modulating release from a depot” says David E. Kelley a retired leader of diabetes and obesity drug discovery at Merck. “It is addressable by modulating clearance in a manner that accelerates as you approach hypoglycemia.”

But the addition of the carbohydrates reduced the potency of the insulin so people had to inject higher doses to get the desired effect Kelley says.

Ultimately Merck discontinued the program. “It was a business decision about where Merck wanted to invest” Kelley says. He hopes that others will be able to build on the science. He still finds the tactic of accelerating insulin clearance attractive because it would increase the range of doses that insulin can be safely given.

Lilly and Novo Nordisk continue to work on glucose-responsive insulins. Neither company’s work is at a stage where the firm is ready to reveal molecular details about its lead molecules. But representatives are willing to talk about why they see the need for such designer insulins.

Novo Nordisk acquired the start-up Ziylo in 2018 for its glucose-responsive insulin platform. Now the company has parallel projects focused on internally developed glucose-responsive technology and the Ziylo technology. “We have not settled on a single technology” Kurtzhals says.

The goal is to equip insulin with a glucose-binding element that would modulate insulin’s binding affinity for its receptor. Ideally the effect would be reversible so that insulin would adopt its active conformation when blood glucose levels are high and would be deactivated when blood glucose levels are low Kurtzhals says. It also needs to be specific to glucose so that the insulin can’t be activated by other molecules in the blood.

“You have to do some advanced chemistry to equip the insulin molecule with those chemical features” Kurtzhals says. And that chemistry needs to be cost effective. “You can’t have chemistry that is so complex that it will never be useful on an industrial scale” Kurtzhals says.

Building glucose responsiveness into insulin is technically challenging Lilly’s Gimeno agrees. “You need to go from zero activity to 100% activity over a roughly threefold change in glucose levels. And you need to somehow build it into a molecule” she says. “That’s actually something that hasn’t been done with any other therapeutic.”

Like Novo Nordisk Lilly bought a start-up—Protomer Technologies—for its glucose-responsive platform. Gimeno won’t go into detail about the technology. “Right now we’re just focusing on getting a molecule into the clinic as quickly as possible” she says.

Other prospects

Whether insulin acts faster slower or in response to glucose researchers would like to deliver insulin orally instead of via injection. But bioavailability—the amount of drug that gets to the bloodstream—has proved to be a major hurdle.

Novo Nordisk reported a clinical proof-of-concept trial (Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2019 DOI: 10.1016/S2213-8587(18)30372-3). But the bioavailability was only about 2%. That’s too low to be commercially viable Kurtzhals says.

We are celebrating the 100th anniversary of insulin with another wave of insulin innovation. Ruth Gimeno vice president for diabetes research and clinical investigation Eli Lilly and Company

Because less than 10% of insulin makes it into circulation when delivered orally Lilly isn’t pursuing oral insulin Gimeno says.

But there’s still hope for an oral formulation. Robert S. Langer and coworkers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are developing ingestible self-orienting devices with microneedles to inject insulin directly into the stomach lining. In a study with pigs the bioavailability of insulin delivered that way was more than 50% (Nat. Biotechnol. 2021 DOI: 10.1038/s41587-021-01024-0). Langer is collaborating with researchers at Novo Nordisk to develop the devices.

Future advances in insulin therapy could also involve combining it with other hormones. One example is amylin which also plays a role in glucose regulation. β Cells produce amylin in addition to insulin so people with type 1 diabetes lack that hormone too. Ideally the two hormones would be given together.

Amylin Pharmaceuticals now part of AstraZeneca developed an amylin analog called pramlintide but it “was so unstable at regular insulin formulation conditions that it couldn’t be mixed with insulin” Stanford’s Appel says. “The two hormones had to be dosed separately.” Because the pancreas releases the two hormones at the same time and at a defined ratio dosing them separately makes it difficult to mimic what happens with a functional pancreas. The new protein-stabilizing additive makes it possible to administer insulin and pramlintide together and the rapid response time of monomeric insulin may enable the dual-hormone drug to properly mimic normal function of the pancreas.

And other pancreatic cells release the hormone glucagon which raises the concentration of glucose in the blood. Glucagon is often used as a rescue drug to counteract hypoglycemia. Some researchers such as Gu and Webber are working on ways to deliver insulin and glucagon together in a glucose-dependent manner.

“Coformulations are an important next frontier in recapitulating this complex metabolic control that our bodies have” Appel says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NuYy5jb20vbmV3LWhvbWUtZm9yLWh1bWFuZS1zb2NpZXR5LW9mLWNoYXJsb3R0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Humane Society of Charlotte plots a new home,"“It started off as an idea and now there are walls” says Emily Cook marketing and communications manager at Humane Society of Charlotte. After years of dreaming and planning the nonprofit is on schedule to open a larger shelter this spring.



Its current campus is owned by the City of Charlotte and has served as the organization’s home since the early 1990s. It includes several different buildings totaling about 10000 square feet. The new building will more than double the size. The nonprofit has raised more than $14.5 million of its $15 million goal.



Animals at the new building will have their own indoor climate-controlled low-stress kennels which Cook refers to as “small hotel rooms.” It will also feature expanded indoor adoption counseling and interaction areas a cat café kitten condos and kennels an education court and other improvements.



The society impacts about 20000 animals annually but hopes to increase that number to 30000 with the larger facility Cook says. During the pandemic it has seen an increase in adoption numbers. Last year a record 3431 animals were adopted versus 2999 a year earlier.

The group also raised about $3.3 million last year for its operations in addition to funds for the new facility.



The added space will benefit the animals and create more space for the group’s 65 employees plus lots of volunteers. “Our staff is really excited to all be together” Cook says.



“There has been a lot of very thoughtful and mindful consideration that has gone into the design of this building” she says. An opening is slated for April or May.",,,,,,

Credit cards are one way for people to boost their credit score with their everyday purchases. However qualifying for a credit card often requires a good credit score so it can be difficult to start building your credit. However fintech companies have been working on innovative solutions to help build your credit score outside of traditional methods. Extra Card has created a debit card that allows people build credit without a credit check or a high credit score to qualify. Below Select looks at how Extra Card works and the different features it offers.

How can Extra be a debit card that improves your credit score?

Extra was founded by Max Hellerstein Cyrus Summerlin and Biren Shah in 2020. Extra works kind of like a charge card. With a charge card cardholders are unable to carry a balance from month-to-month and are required to pay their balances off in full after an interval of time usually every 30 days. With Extra cardholders make a purchase and Extra pays off the merchant at the time of transaction. However Extra connects to your checking account so one day after you make a purchase Extra takes the money from your bank account for that transaction. At the end of the month Extra then reports your card transactions to the credit bureaus Equifax and Experian. Extra does not currently report to Transunion. Extra is in communication with Transunion about its information being added to Transunion's credit reporting says Max Hellerstein Co-Founder and CEO of Extra Card. By reporting cardholder's payments to Equifax and Experian the Extra Card can have a positive impact on your credit score as reported by those two bureaus.

Extra Card (Rewards + Credit Building) Rewards Up to 1% rewards points on all purchases

Welcome bonus None

Annual fee $25 a month or $199 upfront for the year.

Foreign transaction fee N/A — cannot be used internationally

Credit needed None Pros Does not require a security deposit like other credit cards for building credit

No credit check or minimum credit score required Cons Costs $199 annually

Only reports to two credit bureaus Equifax and Experian View More

Using an Extra Card can impact your credit utilization ratio too. The credit utilization ratio is the ratio of credit you're using to the total amount of credit you've been extended. Your credit utilization ratio impacts the 'amount owed' category of your FICO score. The 'amount owed' category comprises 30% of your credit score. Experts recommend keeping your credit utilization ratio under 30% or even 10% if you can. Since the card is paid off daily your credit utilization ratio will reset each day says Hellerstein. When your credit utilization ratio is reset frequently you're more likely to have a low utilization ratio. Having a low utilization ratio also has a positive impact on your credit score. The Extra Card charges no APR or interest because you have to pay off your balance daily. And unlike a credit card Extra won't let you spend more than you have in your bank account so you won't have to worry about overspending and potentially going into debt. In order to qualify for an Extra Card you don't need a credit score either. Extra doesn't perform credit checks but potential cardholders must meet these requirements: Applicants must be 18 years of age or older

You must have an SSN or ITIN number

Applicants must have a US address where you can receive your Extra Card (P.O. boxes are not valid)

Have a checking account at one of 10000 select U.S. banks

Have an iOS device (iPhone or iPad) or an Android device running version 10 or later According to Hellerstein 99% of applicants are approved for the card because all transactions on the card are backed by cash. When cardholders sign up for Extra they are given a spending limit based on the real-time balance of the bank account they choose to connect says Hellerstein.

Fees and rewards

Extra charges either an annual or monthly fee for cardholders. For Extra Credit Building you'll pay $8 a month but if you're willing to pay for the entire year upfront you'll get a slight discount and pay $84. For Extra Credit Building and Rewards you'll pay $12 a month or $108 for the entire year. For the higher price you'll gain access to the Extra Rewards program. Cardholders will earn 5 rewards points for every $1 they spend. Five rewards points are worth up to 1 cent so the redemption value is a only 0.2 cents per point. Essentially you're getting 1% back on all purchases if you redeem your points for max value. Extra has a rewards store available through the Extra App but the offerings in the store vary. According to Hellerstein recent popular items in the store include an electric toothbrush card games gift cards and AirPods. Since Extra is a debit card focused on building credit it's unsurprising that it offers few rewards and little flexibility in how cardholders can redeem their points. The Extra Card cannot be used internationally so there is no foreign transaction fee.

Alternatives to the Extra Card

Extra's fees can be quite a hefty price to pay for trying to raise your credit score. You might consider alternatives like a secured credit card which requires that you put down a deposit that acts as collateral if you don't pay your bills. Typically your credit line is equal to the amount of your deposit. Secured cards are much easier to be approved for if you have bad or no credit. When Select analyzed various secured cards to determine which cards were the best for people with no credit or bad credit and who wanted to improve their scores it ranked the Discover it® Secured Credit Card as the winner. With the Discover it® Secured Credit Card cardholders only need to put down a minimum $200 deposit for a credit line equal to that amount. Starting seven months after account opening Discover will evaluate your credit card account to determine if you can transition to an unsecured line of credit. If you don't want to put down a deposit you might consider the Petal® 1 ""No Annual Fee"" Visa® Credit Card which is catered to people with non-prime credit looking to improve their scores.

Petal® 1 ""No Annual Fee"" Visa® Credit Card Learn More Rewards 2% to 10% cash back at select merchants

Welcome bonus None

Annual fee $0

Intro APR N/A

Regular APR 25.24% - 34.74% variable

Balance transfer fee N/A

Foreign transaction fee None

Credit needed Fair/No Credit Terms apply.

The Petal 1 Card has no annual fee no welcome bonus and earns between 2% - 10% cash back at select merchants. With the Petal 1 Card you'll have to make your monthly payments each month in full or risk having to pay interest. Unlike the Extra card the Petal 1 Card reports to all three credit bureaus has no annual fee or foreign transaction fee (unlike Extra the Petal 1 can be used abroad). Additionally unlike the Extra Card the Petal 1 Card is a credit card so you'll have an entire month to pay off your bill.

Bottom line

The Extra Card can be a useful tool for people who aren't eligible for most credit cards but are looking to boost their credit scores. However the card does have an $8 monthly fee or an $84 annual fee so you might be better off getting a secured credit card with no annual fee in order to build your credit. Secured cards will require a security deposit but you'll typically receive the deposit back and will be eligible for an unsecured card after making your payments on time and in full for a few months. Extra Card also has downsides: Your card history is not reported to all three credit bureaus and it can't be used in foreign countries.

GIC Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund has signed a deal with digital infrastructure company Equinix to build and operate two data centres in Seoul.

The two centres developed by the joint venture are expected to provide more than 45 megawatts (MW) of power capacity to serve cloud service providers and other clients.

“To address demand for cloud and digital infrastructure we have continued to invest in the [Asia-Pacific] region” Charles Meyers Equinix chief executive said.

According to IDC Korea the cloud infrastructure market is expected to reach an average annual growth rate of 15% over the next five years reaching $1.86 billion in sales by 2025.

“More and more organisations are embracing a digital-first strategy to scale their operations enhance the experiences of their customers and unlock the value of technologies like 5G IoT artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)” Meyers said.

“Korea and the broader Asia-Pacific market are both enablers and beneficiaries as organisations prioritise digital transformation.”

Hyperscale Architecture

The data centres use hyperscale architecture so they can be expanded as increased demand is added to the system.

“With more hyperscale providers expanding in Korea to support businesses’ digital infrastructure needs the cloud computing market in the country is expected to flourish” Meyers added.

US-based Equinix entered the Korean market in 2019. Its customers can connect their corporate IT infrastructure to global hyperscale providers including Alibaba Cloud Amazon Web Service Google Cloud Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.

Meyers said Equinix has operated with 100% renewable energy in Korea since 2020. “Equinix is also the first in the data centre industry to commit to reaching global climate-neutrality by 2030.”

Under the terms of Equinix’s joint venture agreement GIC will own an 80% equity interest in the joint venture and Equinix will own the remainder.

The joint venture is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 pending regulatory approval and other conditions.

At the end of last year Equinix suddenly informed clients of their MA2 IBX data centre in Manchester that they intended to close the facility. Such moves typically create an unwanted extra expense for UK broadband ISPs and full fibre (FTTP) builders among others. Not that consumers would notice.

The closure of a data centre which often comes as a shock to customers can create a “major surprise expense” for those affected as one disgruntled client of the aforementioned centre told us because they end up having to rebuild into a different building (exceptions may exist for managed clients). In the case of MA2 Equinix already has several alternative centres in Manchester (e.g. MA1 MA3 and MA4).

NOTE: Equinix also has various data centres in London (e.g. LD3 LD5 LD6 LD8 LD9 plus new ones at LD4 LD7 LD10).

Closures like the one mentioned above don’t usually occur due to a lack of demand either and if anything there seem to be far more centres currently being built than shut. For example Equinix only recently announced plans to build a new £61m International Business Exchange (IBX) data centre in the Agecroft Commerce Park in Salford which is to be called MA5 (due to be completed in Q2 2022).

All of this begs the question why close such centres in the first place? According to the letter that Equinix sent to its clients the company has been evaluating their “real estate portfolio“ which includes “determining which assets are strategic to our business … and the cost/benefit analysis of continuing to operate specific sites.” Apparently MA2 “no longer meets our criteria for continued operation.”

The same letter notes that Equinix’s lease on MA2 is due to expire soon and they will stop operating it from 30th June 2023.

A Spokesperson for Equinix told ISPreview.co.uk: “As stewards of some of the most important digital infrastructure in the world we regularly review our IBX data centre footprint to ensure it is aligned with both our customers’ needs to interconnect with vibrant digital ecosystems as well as our long-term strategic business goals including striving for sustainability excellence. We believe highly scalable and resilient campus environments are the best way to curate these digital ecosystems and when appropriate we make the decision to close legacy sites and work with customers to migrate their operations to optimal locations. After a thorough evaluation it has been determined that the expiration of the lease on MA2 in 2022 provides an opportunity to close the site and that it is in the best interest of customers located at MA2 to migrate to an alternative IBX data centre facility where they will gain access to a wider selection of interconnectivity options business partners and best-in-class IBX data centre facilities and services.”

Much as we said earlier Equinix are not the only data centre operator to hit customers with such an announcement. Meridian House in Docklands is another while Telehouse Metro went at the end of 2020. Oracle is also reported to be considering the closure of its Linlithgow data centre in Scotland and all of this is before we consider smaller DCs which are harder to track.

The suspicion from some quarters is that some of these closures particularly when they impact smaller DCs may have been fuelled by demand from more profitable housing developments. But in other cases it could simply reflect a wider transition toward the cloud or the need to scale-up into bigger or more cost-effective premises. The only upside is that most DCs do seem to give plenty of time to adapt (often measured in years).

None of this will cause too much of an impact for the major network operators (e.g. Openreach Virgin Media CityFibre etc.) because many of those have their own DCs (or exchanges) but smaller players can be much more exposed to such changes. Ultimately ISPs and network builders have no choice but to adapt to such closures but thankfully the drama rarely impacts consumers (unless something has gone very.. wrong).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFuaW52ZXN0b3IubmV0L2FydGljbGUvd2Vla2x5LWludmVzdG9yLXJvdW5kdXAtdGVtYXNlay1hY3F1aXJlcy1lbGVtZW50LW1hdGVyaWFscy1mb3ItbW9yZS10aGFuLTctYmlsbC80NzU1NTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weekly investor roundup: Temasek acquires Element Materials for more than $7 billion; new IPO rules will apply to ...,"Singapore state-owned investor Temasek acquires Element Materials Technology from UK's Bridgepoint Group for more than $7 billion; China’s forthcoming rules on overseas IPOs will apply to Chinese companies that want to list in Hong Kong.

China’s forthcoming rules on overseas IPOs will apply to Chinese companies that want to list in Hong Kong the China Securities Regulatory Commission tells CNBC.

In an exclusive interview with CNBC the commission’s director-general of the international affairs department Shen Bing spoke about what the draft rules will mean for Chinese companies that are planning to list in the US and other markets following last summer’s crackdown.

Shen said the rules will apply not only to Chinese companies wanting to offer H-shares in Hong Kong but also a category called “red chips” which previously did not need the CSRC’s approval.

H-shares refers to stocks issued by mainland China companies that trade in Hong Kong and red chips are Hong Kong-trade shares of companies that conduct most of their business in the mainland but are incorporated outside mainland China.

CHINA

Foreign banks to submit details of Chinese companies’ offshore listings to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on January 31.

The Commission proposed a rule change in which foreign banks working on offshore listings held by Chinese companies will need to submit an annual list of these activities.

Fees charged by banks in the US and Hong Kong for managing these listings were previously private information. Banking analysts are calling the move ‘unprecedented’.

The CSRC hopes to increase accountability overseas for its private companies by reporting wrongdoing or malpractice to the offshore regulatory authority of the offending bank.

The fees collected for public Chinese listings by banks in the United States have been lucrative garnering over US$2 billion since 2016 - many banks believe this new rule will eat heavily into their profits.

SINGAPORE

Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and US digital infrastructure firm Equinix are forming a $525 million joint venture to develop and operate two data centres in Seoul South Korea.

The data centres are expected to provide more than 45 megawatts of capacity to serve the core workload deployment needs of hyperscale companies which include the world’s largest cloud service providers according to Equinix in a statement on January 27.

GIC reportedly owns 80% of the joint venture and the California-based Equinix owns 20%. This will be their third data centre joint venture since their $1 billion Europe-focused partnership in 2019 which was followed by another $1 billion joint venture in 2020 which focused on Japan.

PHOTO: LINDA ROBERTSON

When making profits for people no longer interested Kerrie Young she took a leap of faith into the public sector. Now she is in charge of the lower South Island’s public housing stock. She talks to business reporter Riley Kennedy about the change and her outlook for the region’s housing.

Kerrie Young was sick of making profits for people. So she stopped.

Australian-born and raised Ms Young was a property market economist by trade specialising in property development in high-population growth areas on the Gold Coast.

Five and a-half years later she has recently become Kainga Ora’s regional director for South Canterbury Otago and Southland.

Under Ms Young’s watch the Crown agency owns and manages nearly 2500 houses across the region from the Rangitata River south of which 1400 are in Dunedin and Mosgiel 32 in Central Otago and Queenstown Lakes 40 in Gore and the remainder in Invercargill.

And it is Ms Young’s job to increase those numbers.

Before moving to New Zealand she was based on the Gold Coast operating her own property consultancy business and was president of the Urban Development Institute of Australia for her area in Queensland.

‘‘Supply and demand has been my bread and butter for a long time’’ she said.

Between those two roles she was doing a lot of work for not-for-profits and Crown agencies including on local council economic development plans.

Ms Young got to a point in her life after her two daughters had left home — ‘‘and got the mortgage sorted’’ — when she realised she enjoyed that type of work much more.

‘‘I thought I have a choice now and I want to get up every day enjoying what I’m doing’’ she said.

In 2016 she wound up her business and moved to Melbourne to work for Common Equity Housing Ltd — a cooperative housing not-for-profit aimed at providing affordable housing.

But not long after that Housing New Zealand was recruiting for development managers for the construction of new state houses.

The government department was having trouble finding staff in New Zealand so was recruiting overseas.

Ms Young was approached to apply for the job and was flown to Auckland for an interview.

At the time Housing New Zealand had been given $2 billion from the Government to build more state houses — ‘‘that was when I realised that this was what I wanted to do’’.

‘‘Here I am five and a-half years later and am absolutely loving it’’ she said.

In her first role at Housing NZ she was doing construction development at one point having 33 projects under her watch.

Two years later and feeling she still had more to offer she was approached for a role at the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment managing large-scale land projects.

That role was then moved into Kiwibuild which at the time was a initiative under the new Labour Government aiming to build 100000 houses.

‘‘It was a great ambition but very hard to achieve.’’

One of the big problems the initiative faced was sourcing land to build on and it was Ms Young’s job to find it.

She worked with councils particularly in high-growth areas such as Hamilton Tauranga and Auckland finding ways to unlock those constraints.

But when Kainga Ora was created in 2019 — which combined Housing NZ Kiwibuild and Homes Land Community (HLC) — her role was absorbed into the new entity.

Ms Young spent two years working as the entity’s director of strategic urban partnerships based in Auckland.

The opportunity to move to Dunedin to be the regional director had previously come up early last year. She considered applying but thought she still had too much to achieve in Auckland.

But during last year’s lockdown in Auckland the role came up again. One of Ms Young’s daughters lives in Luggate with her husband and two children. Being separated from them was the most difficult part of the past two years of the pandemic she said.

‘‘It was like fate came and knocked on my door.’’ So she applied for it and left Auckland in October last year — ‘‘I couldn’t wait to leave’’.

Before moving to Dunedin she had spent some time in the lower South Island.

Her daughter studied fashion at Otago Polytechnic and before that she would bring her family over from the Gold Coast to spend winter holidays on the slopes in Queenstown.

‘‘I remember thinking it would be so cool to live in this area . . . now I am.’’

Switching from the private sector to the public sector was a ‘‘complete shock and a completely different ball game’’ she said.

In the public sector particularly around decision-making there were so many more factors to consider.

‘‘We have to consult with people internally at Kainga Ora and also externally with the wider community.’’

Whereas a private developer probably only needed to keep the bank and investors happy.

‘‘Making people profit every day just wasn’t getting me out of bed in the morning.’’

Ms Young wanted to use her ‘‘drive and energy’’ to make sure people in her community were taken care of.

After taking time off over the summer to think about her new role Ms Young had come up with her vision for the entity in the lower South Island.

The first was increasing the public housing stock throughout the region because the waiting list for people wanting to get into homes was always growing and there was not enough stock to keep up with it.

‘‘We know there are people who aren’t even on the waiting list who need a home as well’’ she said.

Ms Young wanted to work with local councils to see how Kainga Ora could help effect change in housing affordability.

‘‘I want to see how we can work to make sure there is affordable homes in the community because we know there isn’t now’’ she said.

Now she had got settled into her new role Dunedin and wider Otago were home and she had no plans to move any time soon.

‘‘I love it here I really do and I don’t want to leave or have any plans to.’’

Asked on Australia Day whether she missed her home country Ms Young admitted she had forgotten about it.

Online retail giants Etsy and Ebay have removed 'barbaric' dog ear cropping kits from their websites after they sparked outrage from vets and campaigners.

The British Veterinary Association (BVA) wrote to the firms after they discovered the cruel kits - which come with a scalpel forceps ten blades and a pair of special scissors - were on sale from international retailers.

Cropping also known as docking is where a young dog's ear lobes are cut away.

It is illegal in the UK under the Animal Welfare Act unless it is carried out for medical reasons.

But some owners have been known to cut puppies' ears to make them look ""tougher"".

The BVA has been running a campaign to outlaw the practice and to educate pet owners that cropping or straightening the ears of their pets is cruel.

President Justine Shotton wrote a letter to express her members' concerns 'about the easy availability of ear straightening or correcting accessories'.

Dr Shotton said: ""We took action after being made aware by a few vets about the availability of ear cropping kits on eBay UK. Our research also found a number of listings for ear straightening accessories being sold via several other major online websites.

""While the Government has promised action to close the legal loophole that allows cropped dogs to be brought into the country from abroad the availability of such accessories online remains hard to tackle.""

It comes after Amazon launched a probe when the kits were found to have been sold on its site.

A spokesperson for the RSPCA demanded action when the cruel kits were spotted on sale for as little as £31 in 2020.

The charity said ear cropping should be banned across the world.

The spokesman said at the time: “We’re extremely concerned at how easy it is to buy home cropping kits online and we’ll be writing to the retailers selling them to urge them to remove them.

Thousands in Massachusetts are without power Sunday night after a powerful winter storm battered the eastern part of the state with snow and strong winds on Saturday.

The National Weather Service declared the storm a blizzard for some areas of eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island Saturday evening.

“Wind gusts reached hurricane force on Cape Ann Cape Cod and Nantucket during the storm” the service said in an announcement.

It also noted that snowfall totals were 1 to 2 feet “across the region.”

Wind gusts during the #MAsnow storm are expected to cause power outages particularly in Eastern MA and Cape/Islands.

Wind gusts up to 65-75 mph were recorded across Cape Cod the islands and Cape Ann which the service said increases the risk of tree damage and power outages.

“The greatest risk could be across Cape Cod the islands and coastal Plymouth county as heavy wet snow combines with these strong/damaging winds” service forecasters said Saturday morning. “In addition these very strong winds combined with snowfall rates of 2-4 [inches] per hour at times will yield blizzard conditions across RI and eastern MA with [visibility] near zero at times. Even after the snow tapers off early this evening there will continue to be considerable blowing and drifting snow.”

Sunday evening Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency tweeted to thank the Barnstable County REPC staff who assisted in the “continued work coordinating with communities across [Cape Cod]” as the area still faced power outages.

Eversource said it is working to restore the power to those already impacted by the storm and urged customers to report outages immediately. At 4 p.m. Sunday Eversource said they expect “restoration to be substantially complete” by 11:59 p.m. on Monday for all customers but most customers “will be restored sooner.”

Snow also wasn't the only problem. These areas also had to deal with flooding strong winds and power lines going down.

In Scituate late Saturday afternoon there were two power trucks stuck in the snow in the same area near Oceanside Drive. First it was a National Grid truck that couldn't get out of the snow.

Two hours later an Eversource truck got stuck in the same spot.

Matt Grozier has lived near Oceanside Drive for more than 20 years. He says this storm packed a punch but knows it could've been worse.

""The sea wall changes have made a massive difference"" said Grozier. ""Five years ago before they added two feet to the sea wall we probably would've seen another foot of water in the yard.""

Scituate Town Administrator James Boudreau say the focus on Saturday night will be restoring power and managing the nighttime storm surge.

""Right now we have about 1200 homes without power in Scituate proper which is about 14%"" Boudreau said. ""The power companies are telling us they'll have crews in tonight. Hopefully they'll have everybody restored by the end of the day tomorrow but it's really going to depend upon the weather.""

Boudreau said the conditions have improved since the start of the day.

""The winds have let up a little bit. We're hoping that the worst has gone by. We have gusts touching 90 miles per hour so it's been pretty much a crazy show down here.""

He also thinks the upcoming storm surge around 9 p.m. won't be as bad as it was this morning.

""We think it's going to be minor to moderate. The winds are kind of shifting around a little bit so that will help. There's going to be race to get it all cleaned up before it starts to freeze.""

Despite the weather no major injuries were reported in Scituate on Saturday.

Town leaders say it could take days to fully assess the damage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzQ4MjgxOC9hZnRlci10aGUtYmxpenphcmQtdGhlLWVhc3QtY29hc3QtZGlncy1vdXQtdW5kZXItc3Vubnktc2t5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After the blizzard the East Coast digs out under sunny sky,"BOSTON (AP) — The sun shone down on much of the East Coast on Sunday a day after a vicious nor’easter brought blizzard conditions to many areas and left more than 100000 customers without power for a stretch that could last into Monday.

Winds that had gusted to more than 80 mph on Saturday died down on Sunday and temperatures climbed into the upper teens and 20s as people emerged from their homes to dig out.

The storm dumped snow from Virginia to Maine but Massachusetts bore the brunt of the fury with the neighboring towns of Sharon and Stoughton getting more than 30 inches (76 centimeters) of snow before the storm moved out.

More than 100000 lost power at the height of the storm mostly in Massachusetts. The outages in Massachusetts had dropped to about 40000 by Sunday afternoon mostly on hard hit Cape Cod. No other states reported widespread outages.

Utility Eversource said Sunday it had 1700 crews working to restore electricity in Massachusetts and customers will have their power back on “by the end of the day Monday with most before then.”

“We know how challenging it is for our customers to be without power especially in this frigid weather” Eversource Vice President for Electric Operations Bill Ritchie said in a statement.

In and around New York City snow totals ranged from a few inches in some areas north and west of the city to more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) in Islip on Long Island according to the National Weather Service. Warren Rhode Island got more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) and Norwich Connecticut finished with 22 inches (56 centimeters). Some areas of Maine and New Hampshire also received more than a foot.

Winds gusted as high as 83 mph (134 kph) on Cape Cod. It scoured the ground bare in some spots and piled the snow into huge drifts in others. Coastal towns flooded with wind and waves battering North Weymouth south of Boston flooding streets with a slurry of frigid water according to video posted on social media. Other videos showed a street underwater on Nantucket and waves crashing against the windows of a building in Plymouth.

A Rhode Island couple got married as planned Saturday during the blizzard according to broadcast reports. Sally Faulkner and Adam Irujo had been planning a wedding for 14 months so they went through with the nuptials on the steps of the Providence Public Library in front of a few family and friends.

Forecasters watched closely for new snowfall records especially in Boston. The Boston area’s modern snowfall record for a winter storm is 27.6 inches (70 centimeters) set in 2003.

The city tied its record for biggest single-day snowfall on Saturday with 23.6 inches (60 centimeters) the National Weather Service said.

Like most major winter storms in New England it drew comparisons to the infamous Blizzard of ’78 which paralyzed the region for days.

“I was around for the Blizzard of ’78 and this one was worse. The wind was tremendous” Joe Brescia 72 said Sunday tears streaming down his face from the bitter cold as he shoveled his sidewalk in Warwick Rhode Island.

Bao Ha 26 didn’t think it was that bad until he went outside to shovel Sunday morning.

“It’s funny it didn’t look so bad when I looked out the window this morning” he said as he shoveled the sidewalk in front of his home in Waltham outside Boston which according to the National Weather Service got 16 inches (40 centimeters) of snow. “But it’s light so it’s easy to shovel.”

Climate change particularly the warming ocean probably influenced the strength of the storm atmospheric researchers said.

Much warmer ocean waters “are certainly playing a role in the strengthening of the storm system and increased moisture available for the storm” said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. “But it isn’t the only thing.”

The storm had two saving graces: Dry snow less capable of snapping trees and tearing down power lines and its timing on a weekend when schools were closed and few people were commuting.

Parts of 10 states were under blizzard warnings at some point: Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island Connecticut New York and New Jersey along with much of the Delmarva Peninsula in Delaware Maryland and Virginia.

The National Weather Service considers a storm a blizzard if it has snowfall or blowing snow as well as winds of at least 35 mph (56 kph) that reduce visibility to a quarter-mile or less for at least three hours. In many areas Saturday’s storm met those criteria.

The pressing need for more computer science graduates combined with tech companies’ pledges to build more racially and ethnically diverse workforces are teeing up a new solution: Empower two-year colleges to offer computer science bachelor’s degrees.

Seattle-based Amazon has stepped up to help the effort. The tech giant recently committed $3 million to Washington state colleges and programs supporting their students.

“We see an opportunity for real growth through the community colleges” said Victor Reinoso global director of Amazon in the Community. “We want to reach the talent where it is and not all of it is in traditional four-year state or private colleges.”

Two-year colleges in general attract a more diverse student body than many universities — about half of Washington’s community and technical college enrollees are students of color.

And computer science could use more diversity. Looking at the 1883 Washington state computer science grads from the 2018-19 school year only 5.6% were Hispanic students 3.8% were African American and less than 1% were Native American.

Last year state lawmakers passed new rules to increase access to the sought-after computer science degrees. Those arguing in favor included the University of Washington and Bellevue College — potential competitors for students — as well as Amazon Microsoft Tableau Facebook community groups and others.

In a survey of available tech jobs in Washington state — including software developers quality assurance analysts and web developers — 48% of listings asked for the applicant to have attained a bachelor’s degree though not specifically in computer science according to a recent Chmura analysis.

The reality is that existing computer science programs can’t keep up with growing workforce demand. From 2010 to 2019 the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded to Washington graduates in computer fields more than tripled but the state still imported four times more graduates than it produced because of employer demand.

“It’s important for us to demonstrate that community college can be a solution” said Shouan Pan chancellor of Seattle Colleges which is comprised of North Seattle Seattle Central and South Seattle colleges.

Other local pathways to tech jobs include four-year degrees from private universities; free programs like Ada Developers Academy Apprenti and Reskill Americans; and more than a dozen coding bootcamps.

Community colleges are more affordable and accessible than many options. The per-quarter cost for an in-state student at the UW is $4026 while a Seattle Colleges student in the bachelor’s degree track would pay $2322. If the student is a graduate of Seattle Public Schools college tuition could be free for the first two years.

The $3 million from Amazon is being equally dispersed among three organizations:

Seattle Colleges Foundation which will help the colleges create the new bachelor’s degree track. The three colleges currently offer two-year associate of science degrees while North Seattle also offers an associate degree with a computer science emphasis.

Washington State Opportunity Scholarship a program matching private donations with state dollars will use its gift to support students pursuing bachelor’s degrees in STEM and healthcare.

The Washington State Board of Community and Technical Colleges which oversees the state’s 34 community and technical colleges and will use the money to help develop the four-year degree program.

For more than a decade Washington’s colleges have offered four-year “applied” science degrees in fields including information technology robotics and AI health care programs and education. In 2016 Bellevue College received permission to become the first community college in the state to offer a bachelor’s degree in computer science.

Seattle Colleges hopes to begin offering the degree starting this fall with an initial cohort of 30 students at North Seattle. The state board expects about a dozen more colleges to offer the degree beginning in 2023.

It’s going to be a challenge but Bellevue College’s early success offers a path forward. The college just east of Seattle receives 130 to 140 applications to its computer science program each year and is accepting 72 students divided into three cohorts with plans to increase the number of students as they’re able to grow their faculty.

One of Pan’s concerns is focused on attracting skilled computer science faculty who are willing to earn college salaries.

“We just can’t match the industry and what these folks would be making” he said.

Fatma Cemile Serçe computer science program chair at Bellevue College said it’s doable.

“The diversity of students that we serve and the fact that we’re providing opportunities for them to achieve better lives is a big draw for faculty” Serçe said. “People want to make a difference and being part of a public higher ed program is a great way to do that.”

Another important question is whether employers will hire the college grads. Again Bellevue College’s experience provides a reason to be hopeful. The college has awarded 86 computer science degrees and reports that 70% are employed in their field.

“We’ve found that they are competitive with graduates from universities and many are employed as full-time software developers in big software companies such as Amazon Microsoft Oracle T-Mobile Expedia Group etc.” Serçe said.

The annual salary for an entry-level role as a computer systems administrator starts around $68500 while a beginning computer programmer can earn $81800 per year according to data analyzed by Chmura and shared by the Spokane Workforce Council.

For its part Amazon said it would be glad to recruit at the colleges. Reinoso said the tech giant could also support mentoring opportunities and work with students to make sure they’re prepared for Amazon’s application process.

Reinoso also left the door open to additional financial support and the possibility of partnering with community colleges outside of Amazon’s home state.

“We do think” he said “that there’s an opportunity nationally for this kind of thing to get replicated.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkueWFob28uY29tL2x1ZnRoYW5zYS11cGdyYWRpbmctcHJlbWl1bS1lY29ub215LXNlYXRzLTEzMjkwMDU0NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lufthansa is upgrading its premium economy seats as the cabin soars in popularity among travelers — meet ZIMprivacy,"The Lufthansa Groups' ZIMprivacy premium economy seats.

People are looking to live a simpler lifestyle – and they're opting for smaller houses and smaller vehicles that could offer that. For those who want to experience both the benefits of a tiny home and the freedom associated with RVs White House Camper's Honda N-Van Compo might just be the ideal candidate.

The west enjoys a large variety of options for those looking to go RVing and they usually tend to stay in the big department. But when it comes to compact vans that pack a lot of features the Japanese really know how to downsize.And we often see that with their Kei car and the campers based on them which are a class of campers entirely unique to Japan. These vehicles' versatility and clever packaging solutions are what impresses everyone. They're a great alternative for folks who want to experience the #vanlife lifestyle but don't have the budget to maintain the big conventional vehicle associated with outdoor exploration.And this mini-camper conversion from Japan-based White House Camper seems to fit the description. The vehicle is based on Honda's tiny N-Van Kei car which was introduced in 2018 for the Japanese market. It's powered by a 660cc engine that produces just about 53 hp in its naturally aspirated form and 63 hp with turbo.It measures 11.1 ft (3.3 meters) in length which makes it about 1.7 ft (about half a meter) shorter than a Mazda MX-5 Miata . That's truly the definition of ""small."" But surprisingly this tiny camper can fit a lot inside.Not only that but with the pup-up tent added by White House Camper the space can be expanded. According to the manufacturer two adults can sleep inside the tent. Thanks to the two mesh windows travelers can enjoy the breeze and the natural light that fills up the interior.When not in use the bed can be removed for extra headroom (you'd get about 70.8 inches/180 cm in total). The N-Van Compo comes in three flavors that reflect a different layout namely the Style-One Style-Two and Cabin.Style One has everything placed at the rear of the vehicle. That includes the kitchen area which comes with a sink a foldable table and a freshwater tank. On top of the sink there's also a microwave and plenty of storage space. Bed mats can be positioned from the rear to the driver's seat to fit one adult with extra room to spare.Those that choose Style Two are in for a layout in which the kitchen area is placed at the rear on the right side. In this way on the opposite side several shelves are installed where the cookware can be put away. Features include an outlet that can be used for charging devices the same foldable table a sink and a comfortable mat for sleeping.The Cabin layout uses every inch of space. This time the driver's seat can be rotated to provide more room that can be utilized either for expanding the sleeping or the kitchen areas. The package also includes a refrigerator and a screen door that keeps insects away.As for the exterior there's not much that White House has done other than mounting a bike rack. The rack can be folded if it's not needed. The manufacturer also provided some options to expand the space once again.Travelers can choose to install a side awning and open the door completely in order to create their own terrace shaded from the sun or rain. They can also opt to add another room to the camper that attaches to the side awning and comes with mesh windows on every side.The price for this N-Van Compo starts at ¥2234100 which is about $19383. It can go up though depending on the interior style chosen and the features added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vc2t5cmltLWJlc3QtcGxheWVyLWhvbWVzLWV2ZXItcmFua2VkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Skyrim: The 10 Best Player Homes Ever Ranked,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vc2t5cmltLWJlc3QtcGxheWVyLWhvbWVzLWV2ZXItcmFua2VkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Renewable power and electric vehicles are getting cheaper the grid is getting greener and oil and gas companies are getting nervous. That's why the fossil fuel giants are looking towards petrochemicals and plastics in particular as their next major growth market. ""Plastics is the Plan B for the fossil fuel industry"" said Judith Enck Founder and President of the nonprofit advocacy group Beyond Plastics. Plastics which are made from fossil fuels are set to drive nearly half of oil demand growth by midcentury according to the International Energy Agency. That outpaces even hard-to-decarbonize sectors like aviation and shipping. ""Every company who is currently engaged in producing plastic if you look at their capital budgets for the next two to three years they're all talking about expansion plans"" said Ramesh Ramachandran CEO of No Plastic Waste an initiative from the Minderoo Foundation that's working to create a market-based approach to a circular plastics economy. Yet much of the developed world is already awash in plastics. So fossil fuel and petrochemical companies are relying on emerging economies in Asia and Africa to drive growth.

Plastic floods the developing world

Alan Gelder of Wood Mackenzie forecasts that every year through 2050 there will be 10 million metric tons of growth in the market for petrochemicals which are used to make plastics and other products. He says much of that will be shipped overseas. ""We're not expecting demand growth in the U.S. but it could be where the places where facilities get built to satisfy global demand growth.""

Alongside Middle Eastern oil giants like Qatar Saudi Arabia and the UAE the United States is a leading producer and exporter of plastic feedstocks and polymers. Asia in general and China specifically are the largest importers of these plastic building blocks. But Enck doubts consumers actually want more plastic ""So what is driving this is just this glut of fracked gas and the fossil fuel industry teaming up with the chemical industry to just crank out more and more plastic."" Indeed an Ipsos survey of over 19000 adults found that 71% of consumers worldwide want to ban single-use plastics. As unpopular as they may be today however plastics became ubiquitous for a reason. ""Petrochemicals are fantastically good at what they do in terms of lightweight flexibility durability versatility"" Gelder said. And thanks in part to fossil fuel subsidies they're also generally the cheapest option available. The problem is that most plastic ends up languishing in landfills or as litter on the land or sea. Only 9% of all plastic ever made has been recycled because generally making virgin plastic is the cheapest option. China used to profitably recycle much of the world's plastic but stopped accepting plastic waste imports in 2018 since much of it was too contaminated to be repurposed. So now that waste is being diverted to poorer nations that don't have the infrastructure to process or recycle it. Africa saw a fourfold increase in plastic waste imports in 2019 the year after China closed its doors. Plastic also flooded into India Malaysia Thailand Indonesia and Vietnam which have since implemented their own import restrictions. But the U.S. is still sending its waste there anyway.

Harmful effects

Meanwhile the domestic petrochemical buildout often has harmful effects on the communities where these plants are located as factory pollutants can effect the surrounding air water and soil. ""So this now makes plastics and plastic production a very serious environmental justice issue"" Enck said ""Because this petrochemical buildout is happening in low income communities and communities of color mostly in Texas Louisiana Ohio and Pennsylvania."" Sharon Lavigne understands these issues well. She lives in St. James Parish Louisiana which lies along a stretch of the Mississippi River often referred to as ""Cancer Alley."" It's home to over 150 petrochemical facilities and refineries and the increased air pollution in the area has been linked to higher levels of cancer in poor communities.

""I found out it was the plants that was poisoning us making us sick and with cancer mostly cancer"" Lavigne said. ""And then I found out that when they come in here they don't hire anybody from Saint James."" In 2018 she founded Rise St. James with the goal of stopping the petrochemical expansion. The organization successfully halted construction of a $1.25 billion plastics plant by Wanhua Chemical and is currently fighting to prevent Formosa Plastics from building a plant in the 5th district where Lavigne lives. However it looks like that project will proceed. The 5th district is 91% Black. ""One time they wanted to build a plant in the white district and a parish council voted it down. They said no"" Lavigne said. But when similar plants were proposed in the 5th district she said they were approved. Overall climate-focused think tank Carbon Tracker estimates that the externalities of plastics production are between $800 to $1400 per metric ton of plastic produced a cost that includes CO2 emissions air pollution waste management and ocean cleanup efforts.

Jordan Peterson a Canadian academic and philosopher popular among the alt-right has come in for heavy criticism following an appearance on Tuesday on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.

On the show Mr Peterson made basic errors speaking about global heating and declared “there’s no such thing as climate."" And in responding to outrage from scores of climate scientists he has noted that his information came in part from a climate-denier who has accepted funding from right-wing billionaires and oil interests.

The fracas began on the show the top podcast in the nation with an estimated audience of 11 million listeners when the Canadian psychology professor argued that the complexity of the world rendered modelling climate change impossible.

“Another problem that bedevils climate modelling too which is that as you stretch out the models across time the errors increase radically. And so maybe you can predict out a week or three weeks or a month or a year but the farther out you predict the more your model is in error” he said. “And that’s a huge problem when you’re trying to model over 100 years because the errors compound just like interest.”

Actual climate experts quickly condemned these statements as a “word salad of nonsense” based on a basic error conflating infinitely variable weather with straightforwardly predictable climate.

Responding to the criticisms Mr Peterson cited the book Hot Talk Cold Science: Global Warming’s Unfinished Debate by S Fred Singer on Twitter on Thursday.

Singer who died in 2020 was the founder of the Science and Environment Policy Project a climate-sceptic advocacy group that received funding from the Heartland Institute a think tank backed by oil interests ExxonMobil and the Koch family as Desmog reports.

Singer held a number of deeply fringe views on climate society calling human climate emissions “trivial” and criticising the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change considered the world’s foremost authority on climate science which makes peer-reviewed findings based on the work of the best climate scientists around the globe.

“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has to provide proof for significant human-caused climate change; yet their climate models have never been validated and are rapidly diverging from actual observations” Singer wrote in an article in 2016.

In fact as climate scientists have noted models have been accurately predicting the climate crisis for decades on end.

“For what it’s worth we have been projecting future warming since the first climate models in the late 1960s/early 1970s” wrote climate scientist and IPCC contributor Zeke Hausfather on Twitter this week. “We can look back to see how well they have performed. It turns out our models generally did a good job.”

“Back in the early 1970s scientists were building simple climate models and they hypothesised that rising greenhouse gas emissions would warm the planet” added Dr Simon Evans policy editor at Carbon Brief in DeSmog. “Well the results are in and those scientists were right. Not only that those models – and other more recent ones – have been pretty accurate in estimating how much warming we would get.”

Jordan Peterson’s statements are “making the ancient climate sceptic error of mixing up weather and climate” Professor Steve Sherwood of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales told The Guardian.

“[Peterson’s] argument is like saying we can’t predict whether a pot of water on a flame will boil because we decide in advance what variables to put in our model and can’t predict each bubble” he said.

The Independent has reached out to Jordan Peterson for comment. The Joe Rogan podcast on Spotify has increasingly come in for criticism on all sides due to its frequent airing of fringe opinions on Covid and other vital topics inspiring rock legend Neil Young to boycott the platform and remove his music until the coronavirus misinformation was removed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlZGVzdHJpYW4udHYvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9qb3JkYW4tcGV0ZXJzb24tY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jordan Peterson Has Admitted His Source From *That* Clip Was An Exxon-Funded Climate Denier,"Canadian clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson has revealed that the academic inspiration behind his climate ramblings on Joe Rogan‘s podcast this past week was from none other than S Fred Singer.

Singer was a physicist whose work was funded by oil giant ExxonMobil. He was also supported by the Koch family who infamously own mineral and fuel extraction company Kick Inustries. Singer passed away in 2020.

First let’s do a cheeky little recap of why we’ve gathered you all here today.

Earlier this week Peterson appeared as a guest on the Joe Rogan Experience. One topic covered in the four-hour and thirteen-minute-long episode was climate change. Oh boy here we fkn go.

One clip from the climate convo went absolutely viral in the days following the episode. We promise it’s not a Saturday Night Live sketch and is in fact real.

Feel free to punish yourself with the following 49 seconds of video and audio chaos below.

Holy moly. I don’t think I can do this. First words out of Peterson’s mouth in the Joe Rogan interview are complete self parody. I can’t even dunk on it. pic.twitter.com/hIDYPi0KDc — bad_stats 🕜💵🖨️🕣 (@thebadstats) January 25 2022

“Another problem that bedevils climate modelling too which is that as you stretch out the models across time the errors increase radically” Peterson says.

“And so maybe you can predict out a week or three weeks or a month or a year but the farther out you predict the more your model is in error.

“And that’s a huge problem when you’re trying to model over 100 years because the errors compound just like interest.”

Unsurprisingly actual climate scientists came out swinging to set the record straight.

One such academic was Professor John Abraham from the University of St Thomas in Minnesota who labelled the chat as “a word salad of nonsense spoken by people who have no sense when it comes to climate”.

“It’s as if someone with zero expertise and knowledge made comments about something he knows little about” he said as per The Guardian.

However there has been a recent development to this spicy tale courtesy of Peterson’s Twitter account yesterday where he tweeted a link to Singer’s book.

DeSmog has published an extensive report on Singer’s continual habit of pocketing dollarydoos from fossil fuel corporations and other climate denying interest groups.

One particularly damning section from the article alleges Singer got USD $5000 a month from the Heartland Institute – a right-wing climate-denying American think-tank which has taken donations from the Koch family and Exxon-Mobil.

He was also a speaker at the 2012 Heartland conference where sponsors snagged $67 mil from Exxon and Koch among others.

Singer also wrote an article arguing that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is still yet to “provide proof for significant human-caused climate change”.

You can read DeSmog’s the full article here.

This isn’t the first time Peterson has twisted himself into a logical pretzel on the world stage.

Australian comedian Jim Jefferies weaved Peterson into his web during an interview on his show.

If you venture onto social media at all the Boston-born Taunton-raised Desir is hard to miss. Now an established real estate agent with Keller Williams those who knew him growing up aren't surprised by his success.

""From the beginning he was nothing but a hard worker and team player and likable young man"" said Doug Alves his basketball coach at Taunton High School.

Alves who now coaches for Bridgewater-Raynham has kept his connection with Desir. Desir was seller's agent for him and his wife in 2020 and brokered the deal for the new-construction home the Alveses closed on in August.

""He's become a lifelong friend"" Alves said Friday ""and someone who I would say is definitely a leader in the community with the many hats that he wears.""

Those hats include his real estate business both commercial and residential a new role in Keller Williams' Sports Entertainment division a clothing brand handling marketing for his family's foundation mentoring young people and playing amateur soccer with the Taunton Spirit.

What ties it all together is Desir's personality. Savvy social media skills get you only so far if people can tell you're not being your authentic self.

""People want to work with people that they know or they like and they can trust"" Desir said in a recent interview. ""I hear it often 'I love what you do.' I'm just being myself.""

Desir spent his early years in Roslindale before his family moved to Taunton in 2005. He admits that it was a ""culture shock"" for an 11-year-old city kid.

""I didn't really have a choice but it worked out"" Desir said.

The Desirs lived in a two-family home in Boston and his parents decided it was time to buy a house.

""At the time for any Haitian family the dream was to buy a house and have that for your family"" he said.

His interest in business developed through high school. He took marketing and entrepreneurship classes at THS and was vice president of DECA a club that encourages entrepreneurship. He graduated THS in 2011 moving on to Bridgewater State where he earned a degree in accounting and finance.

Working retail at Champs Sports at the Silver City Galleria gave him an early crash course in customer service. He then moved into banking. He said he has fond memories of working at Taunton Federal Credit Union. A job at a different bank didn't mesh so well but he was recruited back to TFCU as an admin for the credit union's real estate branch.

""It all came full circle"" Desir said.

It was a short step from the world of real estate financing at the credit union to his first job as a real estate agent with Kelly Lewis Realty. Since 2017 he's been with Keller Williams.

Desir's online presence certainly includes that he's a real estate agent. But more than that he's showing off what he likes best about Taunton and the surrounding area. He works with Ben Eaton at Benjamin Eaton Creative to craft videos and photos.

One recent video in his ""Bordering Boston Food Tour"" is Los Jefes on Broadway. Desir looks like a natural on camera but he'll tell you that he started out hating doing video.

""It's turned into a big part of how I develop new business"" he said.

He gets some inspiration for his online presence from Ryan Serhant. If you're addicted to realty TV with a real estate twist you've probably heard of Serhant. He's on ""Million Dollar Listing New York"" on Bravo for instance. Desir has met with him personally and considers him a mentor.

Family has been an important part of Desir's life. Among his siblings he is to this day the most ""Tauntonian"" of them he says. His mother Maggie lives in Taunton. Also nearby is his sister Sarah in Randolph. Farther afield are sisters Liz and Gabby who live in Maryland.

The siblings formed a foundation to honor their father Serge Desir. He died in 2014 but the foundation aims to keep alive his work by offering scholarships to Haitian-American students.

Desir the son hasn't yet started a family. He's in a long-term relationship with Cortney Marais who owns Hairitage Salon in Taunton. He said he hopes a Serge Desir III might be in the cards at some point.

Alves his former basketball coach laughs when recalling how Desir experienced a growth spurt in college zooming up from the 5-foot-8 that had him used primarily at point guard. That would've come in handy back in high school.

Desir's physical growth spurt ended years ago but his development as a businessman and community-builder might have just begun.

For years early on he was known almost exclusively for getting laughs. With the exception of his first film role — a forgotten slasher flick called He Knows You’re Alone — Hanks spent his first several years in the business in comedic roles. Then in 2000’s Cast Away he made audiences emotional over a volleyball. Thankfully Wilson’s real-life fate is much more lucrative than what happens in that hit movie.

Tom Hanks | 20th Century Fox

Wilson is 1 of Tom Hanks’ most famous co-stars

Cast Away stars Hanks as Chuck Noland a FedEx employee who winds up stranded on a deserted island after a company plane crashes. His only company are the many packages that wash ashore. And while some of the items Chuck finds are useful perhaps the most vital turns out to be a Wilson brand volleyball. After Chuck injures himself he grabs the ball in a fit of rage and throws it leaving a bloody handprint.

As the isolation of his circumstances sets in Chuck ultimately turns that bloody stain into a face for Wilson. In order to stave off loneliness he begins talking to Wilson as if it is his closest friend. After four years on the island Chuck gets more than a little attached to Wilson. And one of the most heart-wrenching moments of Cast Away — for which Hanks received an Oscar nomination — comes when Wilson is lost at sea during Chuck’s escape from the island.

The iconic volleyball was auctioned off for a huge sum

In the film that’s the last audiences see of Wilson. But in real life the volleyball became an iconic bit of movie memorabilia. After all it’s not often a piece of sporting equipment plays a key dramatic role in a major Hollywood release. And according to the BBC the Wilson volleyball used in Cast Away sold at auction for $308000. Considering the item’s tattered appearance its sale price is even more impressive.

Prop House the auction house behind the sale said the volleyball was “heavily distressed with paint applied to create a worn dirtied appearance.” Moreover the dark brown and red face remains intact with the top torn open and replaced with tobacco stalks. In Cast Away Hanks’ character gives Wilson this makeover to simulate hair and make his friend seem more human. Here’s hoping Chuck can rest in peace knowing Wilson went to a good home.

Tom Hanks considers ‘Cast Away’ among his best movies

Given how much of its runtime Hanks spends alone (or with Wilson) Cast Away is definitely one of the actor’s most memorable movies. And in an appearance on The Bill Simmons Podcast he included it among his three favorite moviemaking experiences.

“We had just bold adventures when we were making that movie. [On Cast Away] we were out in the middle of the ocean just trying to grab shots. We were off in Fiji on two different occasions… There was nothing but adventures every single day every single night.”

In addition Hanks included another classic from his filmography 1992’s A League of Their Own in his top three. And he gave a nod to Cloud Atlas the wildly ambitious and commercially disappointing 2012 sci-fi film from directors Lana and Lilly Wachowski.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vaGlwaG9wZHguY29tL25ld3MvaWQuNjc2NDUvdGl0bGUueW91bmctZG9scGgtc3VzcGVjdGVkLWtpbGxlcnMtZ2l2ZW4tMS13ZWVrLXVsdGltYXR1bS1hZnRlci1zdHJ1Z2dsaW5nLXRvLWZpbmQtbGF3eWVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Young Dolph Murder Suspects Given 1-Week To Find Lawyers,"Young Dolph’s alleged killers face a dilemma in the early stages of their trial.

The 2022 Farmers Insurance Open purse is $8.4 million which is a $900000 increase over 2021.

How much money does the 2022 Farmers Insurance Open winner get?

The PGA Tour almost always pays 18 percent of the total purse to the winner so the 2022 Farmers Insurance Open winner's share is $1512000 as the first-place payout.

Patrick Reed won $1188000 as the 2021 Farmers Insurance Open winner's share from a $7.5 million purse. Marc Leishman earned the same PGA Tour first-place payout from the same size purse in 2020.

In this event every player finishing the event earns official prize money with 79th-place finisher earning $15708. Every player also earns FedEx Cup points with the winner receiving 500 points.

The Farmers Insurance Open does not have the biggest purse in professional golf. That belongs to The Players Championship which has a $20 million purse. The US Open is second best with a $12.5 million purse.

However the tournament with the highest first-place payout in all of professional golf now belongs to the European Tour. The winner of the season-ending 2022 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour will win $3000000 making it the biggest first-place payout in all of golf.",,,,,,

Explorer 1 was the first U.S. satellite. It was launched just four months after Russia’s Sputnik 1 went up on October 4 1957. People around the globe heard Sputnik’s unassuming beep beep for 21 days as this first-ever satellite orbited Earth. And they were riveted. It was over our heads! Such a thing had never been known before. Just a month after the launch of Sputnik 1 Russia launched Sputnik 2. It carried a living animal a dog named Laika. So the U.S. was determined to launch its own satellite into orbit. And it did with Explorer 1 on January 31 1958.

This first U.S. satellite was a critical milestone in the earliest days of the 20th century’s space race. And Explorer 1 the third human-made object in space also made a momentous discovery. It made the earliest detection of the Van Allen radiation belts that surround Earth. More about the Van Allen Belts below.

Explorer 1 weighed just 30 pounds (14 kilograms) and was under 7 feet (203 cm) long. It took 114.8 minutes to complete one orbit of Earth – that’s 12.54 orbits a day. Its orbit dipped as low as 220 miles (354 km) and reached a maximum altitude of 1563 miles (2515 km). One scientific instrument onboard a cosmic ray detector took measurements of radiation as the spacecraft orbited Earth. The data it provided led James Van Allen the mission’s lead scientist and his team to conclude that they had discovered charged particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field. Data from other satellites eventually confirmed their finding. These zones of trapped charge particles now bear Van Allen’s name.

It helped spur the space race

Explorer 1’s impact was enormous; it helped spur on what was to become an all-out space race.

Russia had launched Sputnik 1 the world’s first artificial satellite on October 4 1957. The U.S. quickly launched Explorer 1 in response. William Hayward Pickering led a team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that designed and built Explorer 1 in under three months. Pickering was JPL’s director for 22 years until his retirement in 1976.

Explorer 1 flew into space on a Jupiter-C rocket from the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency under the guidance of renowned rocket scientist Wernher von Braun. He had worked for the Nazis during World War II but afterward began working for the United States. During the Apollo program von Braun was the chief architect of the Saturn V the gargantuan rocket that ultimately sent people to the moon.

There were several science instruments aboard Explorer 1: temperature gauges micrometeorite sensors and a cosmic-ray detector. The latter made scientific history by detecting the radiation belts that surrounded Earth. These are zones of charged particles – mostly electrons and protons – that Earth’s magnetic field captures from the solar wind.

Explorer 1 and the Van Allen belts

James Van Allen led a team at the University of Iowa that built Explorer 1’s cosmic ray detector. As the rocket ascended Explorer 1 detected expected count rates from cosmic rays. But in orbit between periods of expected cosmic ray count rates the puzzled scientists saw periods of very high counts and zero counts. Adding to the confusion was difficulty in picking up satellite transmissions and tracking the satellite’s orbital path.

Van Allen’s graduate student Carl McIlwain suggested that the zero counts could be due to a very high concentration of charged particles that caused the detector to saturate and therefore record zero counts. McIlwain tested and confirmed this idea in a lab by subjecting a similar detector to an intense source of X-rays. That led the scientists to realize they had discovered a belt of charged particles trapped by the Earth’s magnetic field a hypothesis that other scientists Kristian Birkeland and Carl Stoermer had proposed some time back.

Another satellite Explorer 3 launched only two months later (after Explorer 2 failed). It was almost identical to Explorer 1 but had a tape recorder that was able to replay the cosmic-ray detector data back to the ground providing radiation readings over each orbit.

Using this higher-quality data the scientists confirmed the presence of a radiation belt. They’re now known as the Van Allen radiation belts.

Probing the Van Allen belts

Subsequent space missions have returned data that better characterizes the Van Allen Belts. There are two main belts. The inner Van Allen Belt typically extends from 620 miles (1000 kilometers) to 7500 miles (12000 kilometers) above the Earth but may vary based on solar activity. The outer belt can vary even more in shape and size usually extending in altitude from 8100 to 37300 miles (13000 to 60000 km).

In February 2013 NASA announced the discovery of a third radiation belt. This one was a transient phenomenon tied to solar activity. NASA deployed satellites named the Van Allen probes to study the radiation belts which discovered the new temporary belt.

We now know that radiation belts are quite common. Other planets in our solar system – such as Jupiter Saturn and Uranus – also have radiation belts similar to Earth’s. Generally speaking space radiation poses a risk both to astronauts and to spacecraft. But NASA and other space agencies have found ways to cope with the radiation. As this article in Forbes points out:

Charged particles [like those in the Van Allen belts] are damaging to human bodies. But the amount of damage done can range from none to lethal depending on the energy those particles deposit the density of those particles and the length of time you spend being exposed to them.

So how do astronauts survive a passage through the Van Allen belts? They travel through quickly minimizing their exposure to the radiation.

Explorer 1’s fate

Explorer 1 transmitted data for about four months till its batteries died on May 21 1958. But it remained in orbit around Earth for 12 years. It circled Earth 58376 times before burning up upon reentry into the atmosphere on March 31 1970.

Check out this 1958 documentary about the Explorer 1 satellite (28 minutes).

Bottom line: Explorer 1 was the first satellite launched by the United States. It flew into Earth orbit on a Jupiter-C rocket on January 31 1958. It gave the U.S. a big boost in the early days of the U.S.-Soviet space race. This pioneering satellite also carried a scientific instrument that detected what we now know as the Van Allen Belts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9qYW1lcy13ZWJiLXNwYWNlLXRlbGVzY29wZS1maXJzdC10YXJnZXQtc3RhctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The James Webb Space Telescope's 1st target star is in the Big Dipper. Here's where to see it.,"The James Webb Space Telescope's first target a star named HD 84406 is located in the constellation Ursa Major near the Big Dipper.

The James Webb Space Telescope is setting its eyes towards the Big Dipper.

Although the spacecraft is still months away from beginning its official scientific observations one particularly bright star named HD 84406 will soon be the object of JWST's attention.

""Star light star bright … the first star Webb will see is HD 84406 a sun-like star about 260 light years away"" NASA officials tweeted on Friday (Jan. 28) via JWST's official Twitter account.

HD 84406 is located in the constellation Ursa Major which means ""Big Bear"" in Latin. The Big Dipper asterism (or star pattern) is actually part of this constellation and it's the tail of this furry beast. The star has a visual magnitude of about 6.9 which is too dim to see with the naked eye. To see the star you'll need a telescope or high-power binoculars. Here's our guide for the best telescopes for 2022 and our guide for the best binoculars may help you find the right pair to hunt Webb's star.

Now that JWST has reached its final destination in space the mission team is getting the next-generation space telescope prepped for observations. A bright point like HD 84406 provides a helpful target by which the team can align JWST's honeycomb-shaped mirrors and to start gathering engineering data according to the tweet.

""HD 84406 will be too bright to study with Webb once the telescope starts to come into focus. But for now it is the perfect target to begin our search for photons a search that will lead us to the distant universe"" according to a NASA blog post published on Thursday (Jan. 27) written by Jonathan Gardner Webb deputy senior project scientist from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Alexandra Lockwood project scientist for Webb science communications at Space Telescope Science Institute.

In addition to JWST placing itself in its observational perch this week has marked another important development for JWST. According to the blog post the team has also turned on JWST's High-Gain Antenna and it can now downlink observations via the Deep Space Network's Ka radio band a channel that ""provides a much higher data rate"" to download science images and data for astronomers to analyze.

Or follow us on Google News

New York City has committed to going all electric with its school buses by 2035. The first electric school buses are hitting the city’s streets now and they are pioneering a new model for transitioning their fleet. Instead of buying buses Logan Bus Company which provides transportation services for the city is having 5 older diesel buses converted to electric.

The technical term for this conversion is a repower. Repowers involve converting an existing diesel bus by removing the internal combustion engine components and replacing them with an electric drivetrain motor and batteries. In New York City’s case a company called Unique Electric Solutions (UES) is doing the repower. To our knowledge UES is the first company to repower a school bus since early efforts by Blue Bird in the 1990s with the ancient lead-acid technology of 30 years ago. The first diesel to electric school bus repower of modern times occurred in 2017 when UES repowered two buses for Suffolk Transportation Services. Four years later those buses are still on the road.

These repowered school buses in New York also might be the first of an oncoming tidal wave of repowered diesel to electric buses. The companies SEA Electric and Midwest Transit Equipment just announced an effort to repower 10000 buses over the next five years. If these companies succeed in converting all of these buses from diesel to electric it would increase the number of electric school buses on the road today by a factor of 10.

How Do Repowers Work?

UES Vice President Mike Backman walked me through his company’s repower process. Before a repower can occur a route and needs assessment must be conducted. All school bus manufacturers work with districts to see how far the route is and what its terrain is like. If a district’s route is relatively short and flat this initial assessment will size a battery accordingly and save a school district money since batteries are the most expensive part of a vehicle. For repowers the batteries typically come in modular sizes of 50 kWh meaning a school district can add more battery packs to a repowered bus to increase range. Ranges typically vary from 70-100 miles.

Repowers also include a bus assessment. “Buses are all different” Backman explained “some are better suited than others for repowers.” There is a sweet spot in age and condition for school bus repowers. Brand new buses and vehicles can be repowered but at that point it almost feels like you might as well have built the bus electric to begin with. Still companies are doing it. Lightning E-motors for example takes brand new Ford Transits and converts them to electric transit vans. On the other hand if a vehicle is too old or worn down it runs the risk of putting sparkling new electric components into a shell that is near retirement. The sweet spot age for repowers runs from 3 to 12 years old (depending upon weather and geography).

After the vehicle assessment comes the conversion process and this is where the repower shifts into full gear (poor pun intended — ESBs often don’t have transmissions). “All of the dirty stuff gets taken out including the engine the diesel fuel tanks and fuel lines the turbo charger transmission the tailpipe muffler etc.” Backman said. “Basically all of those will come out and in their place we’ll put a single clean electric motor with only a handful of moving parts along with electronics cabling batteries and a driver dashboard.”

The once-diesel bus becomes electric. The final step is quality control and safety check. These buses carry precious cargo and this task is of course crucial. After that the bus is ready to go into action.

Potential Upsides to Repowers

Speed of conversion: Repowers take only a matter of weeks which is substantially less than getting into line for a new electric bus although current parts shortages plaguing the automotive industry are also affecting repowers.

Cost: The cost of repowers is extremely compelling and targets the biggest barrier to adoption of electric school buses. Repowering buses from diesel to electric costs less than half of most new electric school buses. A typical repower costs between $125000 and $175000 depending on battery size compared to a new electric school bus which typically runs between $350000 and $400000. Traditional diesel school buses are usually in the $125000 to $150000 range.

Repowers Make Some Districts & Private Operators Nervous

Some districts and private operators I’ve talked with are nervous about the idea of repowers for liability reasons. They worry that substituting the original diesel components of a bus increases the likelihood that something could mechanically go wrong while buses are transporting our most vulnerable population — students.

Companies like UES respond that retrofits have been happening for years they’ve just been diesel propane or CNG retrofits rather than electric ones. And they say that diesel to electric repowers remove only the drivetrain components without touching other existing systems. Repowers remove the majority of mechanical parts that cause breakdowns and so there is the expectation that they will be subject to less mechanical issues in general compared to diesel buses like all electric vehicles. And they reduce other dangers like harmful diesel fumes.

Another concern with repowers is the longevity of the old chassis. If you’re converting a 5- to 12-year-old diesel bus into an electric bus it may not make sense to have a new drivetrain that can outlast the old body and chassis.

Repowers are still on the bleeding edge of electric school bus technology so we won’t have extensive data on longevity of these vehicles for some time. But there are reasons for optimism. Repowering a vehicle removes many maintenance-prone components. Companies predict these electric drivetrains may last long enough to be reinstalled into yet other repowered vehicles after the bus chassis/body itself expires.

First NYC Buses Benefiting from Managed Charging

AMPLY is part of a wave of charge management companies figuring out how to make it easy for districts to electrify their fleets. These companies are pioneering a model where they front the upfront costs of installing charging stations and protect districts from the variability of electricity prices which can change dramatically depending on what time of day you charge your bus. When contracting with a charge management company districts pay consistent costs for electric fuel over the period of their contract that are cheaper than fossil fuels. In New York City AMPLY will cover the costs of installing chargers and Logan Bus Company will pay by the kWh of electricity they use or by the mile. This model is similar to the Power Purchase Agreements in the solar industry that started a decade or so ago where companies installed solar on customers’ roofs for free and then customers paid them back through normal electricity costs over time.

In this NYC project these first 5 electric buses will also provide power back to the grid during peak times of electricity usage. Using electricity stored in the buses has a great potential to help local utilities reduce their reliance on fossil fuel power plants which ramp up during times of heavy demand. A Thomas Built Bus was able to provide 3 megawatts back to the grid in a pilot in Massachusetts this past summer proving the vast potential for school buses to provide this service. Vehicle-to-Grid charging with electric school buses is still in its infancy and it’s exciting that AMPLY will share the data it collects from the project so we can all learn more.

The first electric buses to hit NYC’s streets will thus benefit from significant innovation. They’ll be converted from running on dirty diesel to clean electrons. They’ll cost less than half the price of a new electric school bus and they’ll benefit from managed charging where the school district won’t have to pay high upfront charger installation costs and won’t have to worry about uncertain variable electricity rates. They’ll also help power the grid during times of peak demand. The team on this project is attempting to solve some of the major barriers to school bus electrification and if they’re successful could speed up electric school bus adoption everywhere.

The fight for leadership in the Eastern Conference remains very close. The difference between the Miami Heat (current leaders) and the 7th best team in the East the Charlotte Hornets is only 4 wins (very different from the Western Conference where the Suns are 14 games ahead of the 7th the Clippers). That is why the Milwaukee Bucks currently in 4th place only need a couple of wins to be leaders.

In the case of the Denver Nuggets they continue to defend their 6th place in the Western Conference the last one that ensures a place in the Playoffs without having to play the Play-in. For now they have a good difference over the 7th with a balance of 27-21 against the Los Angeles Clippers 25-26. In fact the Nuggets are just one win away from the Dallas Mavericks and by winning this game they could tie them in the 5th place.

This would be the case in Milwaukee and Denver teams that play just twice a year since the Bucks moved out of the Western Conference in 1980. The only time they met in the postseason was in 1978 which was a semifinal round the Nuggets won in six games.

And yet Sunday’s 136-100 Nuggets victory was a highlight game one the league loves. It featured the two winners of the last three most valuable player awards in Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokić international stars and the two most efficient offensive players in the 75-year history of the league.

The two front-runners for the MVP this season did not disappoint.

BOX SCORE: Nuggets 136 Bucks 100

Antetokounmpo who will start his sixth straight all-star game in a few weeks scored 29 points had nine rebounds and two assists in 31 minutes. The two assists were his fewest in a game since Dec. 6.

Jokić who will head to his fourth straight all-star game nearly had a triple-double with 18 points 15 assists and nine rebounds in 28 minutes.

As a team Denver continued its recent surge with the victory that was its fifth straight and 10th in 13 games. Milwaukee fell to 31-21 overall and 19-5 when its Big Three of Antetokounmpo Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday play.

“I think it was a lot (of factors) -- we played bad"" Holiday said. ""Taking nothing away from them they played great but we played bad. I feel like we did all around. We didn’t really give ourselves a chance to win today.”

Middleton scored nine points on 4 of 8 shooting. The last time he didn’t reach double figures was Dec. 13 in Boston when he suffered a knee injury. Holiday finished with 14 points on 6 of 9 shooting and had eight assists. Grayson Allen and Bobby Portis has 11 points apiece.

Turnovers and sharp ball movement by Denver did Milwaukee in as the Nuggets scored 27 points off 15 Bucks turnovers and recorded a season-high 39 assists on their 53 made field goals.

“At the end of the day we kind of gave them what they wanted which was to get everybody involved” Antetokounmpo said. “Nikola he gets going by passing the ball. He doesn’t get going by scoring the ball. So like I feel like we had to personally in my opinion play straight up make him just go one-on-one all night long and everybody take that individual pride and guard your own man. We didn’t do that. They had (23) threes. They shot the ball very well.”

On how his team handled the Nuggets’ ball movement Budenholzer had a simple assessment: “Not well.”

Even with the bench players on the floor for the final minutes the Nuggets shot 60.2%.

“It’s gotta be significantly better and we gotta face it and own it” Budenholzer said of a recent stretch of opponents hitting a high rate of shots from deep. “Shooting 50% 60% from the field 50-plus from the three-point line. Credit to Denver first they played great but a lot to be desired from our defense.”

Marquette University alumnus Markus Howard hit 3 threes in the final minutes to help Denver finish 23-for-43 (53.5%) from beyond the arc.

Aaron Gordon was a force for the Nuggets with a team-high 24 points in 28 minutes. He made 10 of his 17 shots including 4 of 8 from beyond the three-point line. Monté Morris had 18 points and seven assists and Will Barton added 15 points and five assists for Denver.

“I feel like tonight we kind of wanted to make everybody else but Jokić make a play or beat us – they did a hell of a job” Holiday said. “It’s a lot of threes. It’s a lot of good looks for ‘em. So it’s something we’ve got to back on and probably re-evaluate.”

Budenholzer pulled his starters with 5 minutes 55 seconds left in the game. His team was trailing 118-93 and hadn't made a dent in a 22-point deficit to open the quarter. Instead the Denver bench led by former Bucks guard Bryn Forbes extended the lead to as many as 26 in the quarter. Milwaukee made just two field goals in the first six minutes of the fourth.

Forbes who played in his sixth game with the Nuggets had 14 off the bench. Denver outscored Milwaukee’s reserves 59-26. Nah'Shon Hyland had 13 points and six assists off the bench for Denver.

Gordon scored 11 points in the third quarter to help the Nuggets push an eight-point halftime advantage to a 103-81 lead heading into the fourth. The Nuggets made 16 of their 20 shots (80%) including six of their nine three-pointers to outpace the Bucks quickly. Denver opened the quarter on a 19-7 stretch over the first six minutes to go up 84-64 and though the Bucks would cut it to 72-86 a couple minutes later they couldn’t sustain any momentum on either side of the court. Antetokounmpo was held to two points on 1-for-5 shooting.

Led by crisp ball movement that resulted in 20 assists on 24 field goals Denver took a 65-57 lead into the half. Eleven of those made field goals were three-pointers. The Nuggets led by as many as 12 late in the half before Antetokounmpo scored seven straight points in the final 82 seconds.

Antetokounmpo scored 15 of his 22 first-half points in the second quarter and made 7 of 11 free throws in the half. Holiday had 12 points and five assists while Middleton was held to two points on 1 of 4 shooting. Jokić had nine points and assists five rebounds and four steals while Gordon led the Nuggets with 13 points. Morris and Hyland added 11 points apiece for Denver.

Denver was also able to take advantage of Milwaukee’s mistakes scoring 13 points off nine Bucks turnovers.

Jokić had eight of his assists in the first quarter alone as the Nuggets took a 33-30 lead. A 12-2 run late in the quarter erased a 21-17 Bucks lead. Denver used the three-point line to lead throughout the second quarter making five of their 10 attempts from deep. Milwaukee never got closer than four points in the quarter as Antetokounmpo and Holiday accounted for 25 of their team’s 27 points. Jordan Nwora was the only other Bucks player to score in the second quarter.",,,,,,

The Ford water pump class action lawsuit was filed by Kimberley Carter Keith Halliday and Deonarine Phagoo all who argue the defective water pumps cause catastrophic engine failures.

The plaintiffs allege the water pumps leak coolant into other engine parts which damages engine components.

The Ontario Superior Court of Justice certified the water pump class action against both Ford Motor Company and Ford Motor Company of Canada Limited. However many claims against Ford were not allowed to continue.

First the judge made revisions to the class definition and to other common issues. Then numerous claims were not certified including claims in negligence for negligent manufacturing failure to warn and for the ""cost of repairing a dangerous product that presents a real and substantial danger.""

The judge also refused to certify contract and unjust enrichment claims and Ford Credit Canada Limited was removed as a defendant.

The judge did certify a class action for negligence in design but only if the water pump failed and the vehicle suffered damage or if the vehicle suffered damage and the customer suffered an injury.

Despite loads of shortcomings that we’ll touch on later the bite-the-back-of-your-hand pretty GT was the first Aston Martin developed under the watchful eye of the Ford Motor Company and the car that saved Aston Martin from yet another bankruptcy.

The origin story of the DB7 begins with British engineering company TWR. Its founder British racing driver Tom Walkinshaw fielded the Jaguar XJS in the European Touring Car Championship and he always wanted to modernize this car to create a successor for the V12-engined grand tourer.Peter Stevens the gentleman who designed the McLaren F1 alongside Gordon Murray was originally approached for this project. But Stevens had other things on his plate back then which brings us to another big name in the automotive industry. Tom Walkinshaw approached a then-young Ian Callum and the newcomer obviously said that he was in.During this period Jaguar was owned by the Ford Motor Company as well. The Leaping Cat of Coventry was barely making ends meet which is why the XJS-replacing XJ41/42 project was completely scrapped. Tom Walkinshaw took a liking to the XJ41 coupe tasking Ian Callum to pen a beautiful shell for the stillborn grand touring car. Jaguar’s executives and bean counters rejected the design study which brings us to arguably the most important gentleman in the DB7’s origin story: Walter Leopold Arthur Hayes.The former journalist and later public relations executive at Ford cemented the Blue Oval’s relationship with Colin Chapman of Lotus fame. He also convinced engine specialist Cosworth to develop the iconic DFV that dominated every Formula 1 Grand Prix in 1969 and 1973. As a matter of fact DFV racecars won a total of 155 Grands Prix from 1967 and 1985.Hayes saw the potential in the XJ41 coupe's makeover later known as the F-Type together with the XJ42 convertible which is why he approached TWR with a simple task: redesign the car to look more like an Aston Martin But even with Ford’s backing Aston Martin couldn’t spend too many dollars (or pounds sterling) on the DB7. This explains the “Ford Parts Bin Special” in the headline consisting of Scorpio interior door mirror switches and Tibbe disc tumbler locks with an eight-disc layout rather than Ford’s six discs.Mazda was in cahoots with Ford back then hence the 323 taillights 323 door handles and MX-5 turn signals. The wing mirrors on the other hand were curiously sourced from the Citroen CX. Jaguar also used the eight-disc locks mentioned earlier and you shouldn’t be surprised by that because the XK shares its XJS-derived platform with the Aston Martin DB7.Presented at the 1993 Geneva Motor Show and dubbed the most beautiful car of that era the DB7 entered production in 1994 at the TWR Bloxham factory where the Jaguar XJ220 used to be made. The straight-six engine an AJ6-derived lump gifted with an Eaton supercharger for extra oomph was famously described as having less power than a parish council.Motoring journalists weren’t exactly impressed by the handling and build quality either. But against all odds the DB7 changed Aston Martin’s fortunes for the better due to its relatively accessible price tag and superlative looks. It was approximately half the price of the Virage-Volante-Vantage trio the British automaker's V8-powered flagships of the 1990s.Aston Martin improved its grand tourer for the 1997 model year with the Series 2 then phased out the blown straight-six engine by mid-1999 in favor of the V12 Vantage. AM01 is the codename of the engine that Aston Martin used through 2020 under many other codenames a Cosworth-developed mill that wouldn’t have been possible without FoMoCo’s backing.The V12 GT and automatic transmission-equipped V12 GTA arrived in 2002 with much-needed suspension improvements and a mesh front grille that looks much better than the original design. The DB7’s production came to a grinding halt with the Zagato and DB AR1 special editions which were both designed by the coachbuilder in collaboration with Henrik Fisker.A little over 7100 units of the DB7 rolled off the assembly line from 1994 through 2004 the year the Callum-penned DB9 entered the scene.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldDExMDU0OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter N.

The United Aviate Academy is the first flight school owned by a major U.S. airline. United welcomed its first class of students which is made up of 80% women or people of color.

""Our pilots are the best in the industry and have set a high standard of excellence"" United CEO Scott Kirby said in a press release. ""Recruiting and training even more people who have that same level of talent motivation and skill is the right thing to do and will make us an even better airline.""

The academy provides an important source for recruitment as the industry faces a potential shortage of around 34000 pilots globally by 2025 according to analytics firm Oliver Wyman. The shortage will result from an aging pilot population and career changes for furloughed pilots who couldn't wait for the airlines to rehire them.

Lauren will make an undisclosed capital investment in the asset manager’s Franklin Venture Partners unit which focuses on mid- and late-stage private companies.

More from WWD

Franklin Ventures will look to put the money to work at consumer technology firms with a particular focus on companies led by women. In addition to marching toward greater gender equality Lauren said it would get a chance to “collaborate with others to develop and deploy new technologies.”

Lauren has taken a similar approach of investing and partnering to build in a new area before. In 2020 the company made a minority investment in sustainable material start-up Natural Fiber Welding Inc. which is working on turning natural fibers such as cotton waste into high-performance materials.

By working with Franklin Ventures on consumer technology the company opens itself to a world of innovation where the players are often peeking over the horizon and looking at what comes next.

“The powerful combination of honoring our heritage while embracing innovation has guided our brand and business for decades” said Patrice Louvet Ralph Lauren’s president and chief executive officer. “Participating in opportunities like this one with Franklin Venture Partners is one example of how we are pursuing new pathways for innovation and we are excited to support the growth of these companies and benefit from insights and technology that can help guide our company and our industry’s future.”

Ralph Lauren helped define and lead an age of fashion that was characterized by big department store presentations and flashy magazine ads.

But now that the game has changed — and is continuing to change at a blinding pace — Lauren is making sure to stay out front from sustainability to the metaverse.

Last month Lauren launched an all-digital Roblox exclusive collection — and used it as another opportunity to connect the brand’s past with its future.

The collection drew inspiration from the signature Polo Sport line from the 1990s and was available at the Ralph Lauren Winter Escape virtual holiday destination.

SAFFORD – The Gila Valley Arts Council is proud to present the iconic folk music group The Brothers Four on Wednesday on Feb. 9 starting at 7 p.m. at the David M. Player Center for the Arts on the campus of Safford High School.

Now in their 60th year of performing and recording The Brothers Four continue to delight millions of fans worldwide with their smooth musical sounds. Folk songs from America Ireland Scotland Africa Japan and China round out a repertoire of acoustic tunes old and new.

Since the early 1960s The Brothers Four have played thousands of college concerts sung for U.S. presidents at the White House appeared at countless Community Concerts performed with symphony orchestras and jazz stars and toured dozens of foreign countries. They are truly “America’s Musical Ambassadors to the World.”

Musical million-sellers for The Brothers Four include such releases as “Greenfields” “Seven Daffodils” “Try to Remember” “Across the Wide Missouri” Their hit recording of “The Green Leaves of Summer” from the motion picture “The Alamo” was nominated for an Academy Award and they performed the song at the awards presentation for the network telecast.

The Brothers Four were global pioneers in the musical movement which came to be known as the “folk revival” and of the few groups from those times still performing today they remain one of the best known and most popular. Their all-acoustic presentation consists of guitars banjo upright bass and of course the trademark rich blend of their four voices. An evening with this quartet is an unforgettable time of pure acoustic music and entertainment.

The full-time lineup of The Brothers Four — as solid as ever — includes Mike McCoy Karl Olsen Mark Pearson and Bob Flick.

Mike McCoy is a veteran folk performer and singer/songwriter. He is a native of Washington State has performed with The Brothers Four on special recording projects and occasional stage presentations since the late 1960s. He joined the Brothers Four full-time in 2004.

Washington native Karl Olsen is a folk performer choral director writer and arranger. Karl is the latest addition to the group having joined in 2008 blending his sparkling vocal and guitar skills smoothly into the sound of The Brothers Four.

Washington State’s Mark Pearson is a guitarist banjo player extraordinaire and singer/songwriter who has been a strong and consistent part of the Group’s signature sound since he originally joined in the late 1960s.

Bob Flick is a Founding Member of the Brothers Four. He is a Seattle native bass player group leader and singer/songwriter.

GRMN,Garmin,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbmdsZXRyYWNrcy5jb20vbXRiLWdlYXIvaGF2ZW50LXdlLWJlZW4taGVyZS1iZWZvcmUtcmV2aWV3aW5nLXRoZS1icnl0b24tcmlkZXItczUwMC1ncHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Think We've Been Here Before. Reviewing the Bryton Rider S500 GPS,"Bryton recently cranked out the first device in a new “S” series of premium GPS units dubbed the Rider S500. While the unit adds a few MTB-focused features not included in their previous color-screen models many of the upgrades seem to be geared toward playing nice with other devices like indoor smart trainers and radar units for road biking.

Physical specs

The Bryton Rider S500 is a mid-size GPS unit with a 240x320px color screen (2.4″ diagonal) that weighs 87.3g. The bezel around the top and bottom of the screen is especially large compared to other units I’ve tested like the Garmin Edge 530 resulting in a noticeably smaller screen size despite similar resolution and overall unit dimensions. Bryton seems to be using some of that extra space for a bigger — or at least longer-lasting — battery than some of their previous models claiming 24 hours of runtime for the S500. That claim seems about right based on my testing; I clocked about 12 hours of ride time over three rides on a single charge with 49% battery life to spare.

The Rider S500 needs just four physical buttons — two on each side — to operate the device which helps flatten the learning curve a bit compared to others with more buttons. Navigating menus and functions is relatively painless though for certain tasks like customizing data screens the free Bryton smartphone companion app is invaluable.

In addition to the buttons the device also features a touch screen that’s surprisingly responsive. Previous units from Bryton felt laggy and almost every other cycling GPS screen I’ve tried hasn’t been great at registering touch inputs especially compared to smartphone screens. Swiping between data screens is no problem even when wearing gloves though naked fingers work best for really delicate operations like panning and zooming the map.

One of the main feature upgrades the S500 brings to the Bryton line is an ambient light sensor that adjusts the screen’s brightness. I found it works pretty well and ensures the screen is readable in full sun and on night rides alike. Even subtle changes like a passing cloud or transitioning from shady singletrack to an open area adjusts the backlight and brightness.

The device is charged using a standard USB-C connector.

Technically these are all quarter-turn mounts though none of them are compatible. Fortunately the Rider S500 includes hardware for Bryton and Garmin mounts.

Mounts

I’m about to go on a mini-rant about GPS mounts so bear with me here. Really this applies to anything in the cycling world that’s bar-mounted from GPS units to cameras and lights.

Can we all please just use the same mounts?

I get it no one wants to invent a thing that all their competitors latch onto and copy and the licensing fees are likely pretty sweet for the inventor. Garmin seems to have invented the quarter-turn mount system then Wahoo rotated the thing 90° for some unknown reason (though I have a guess). Later Bryton came along and kept the same orientation as the Garmin mount but made the locking tabs fatter so there’s no swapping between the two.

You and I the consumers are caught in the middle of all of this nonsense and end up with a drawer full of mounts every time we upgrade to a competitor’s GPS. End rant.

Fortunately all is not lost because Bryton now includes a Garmin-compatible mount in the S500 box along with a tiny screwdriver for making the swap.

Trail features

The Bryton Rider S500 does all the usual stuff tracking speed distance elevation grade and the like. Pre-loaded basemaps include not just roads but also trails and now markers for points of interest like bike shops water fountains etc.

Easily the most disappointing thing about the Bryton Rider S500 is the fact that the digital breadcrumb display showing where you’ve already ridden is really really hard to see. I rely on this standard cycling GPS feature heavily and an informal poll among riding friends reveals they do as well. It’s as if the Bryton designers have only ever used GPS in a car where no one really needs a breadcrumb. The difference as riders know is that most bike rides start and end in the same place and mountain bike rides in particular often involve a lariat or figure 8 or some other configuration where the rider ends up somewhere they’ve already been. Or as is occasionally the case mountain bikers get lost and need to backtrack or find a shortcut. On the Bryton Rider S500 the line showing where you’ve been is one pixel wide and is a blue-ish green color that’s nearly impossible to see. In fact I didn’t even realize it was there until after my first few rides. Unfortunately I couldn’t find a way to change the color or thickness of the line.

If you do want to retrace your route back to the start you can swipe up on the map screen choose ‘Courses’ then ‘Route’ then ‘Retrace Route.’ Navigating a retrace shows a bold thick line that’s much easier to identify.

Garmin Edge 530 (right) with a 2.6″ diagonal screen for comparison. Despite its slightly larger screen the Edge 530 is roughly the same size as the Bryton Rider S500 thanks to narrower bezels.

There are a number of options for navigation with the Rider S500 though some of the more complex use cases like automatic reroutes and voice navigation require a connected smartphone that is in turn connected to the internet. There’s a new Live Track feature as well which is a nice safety feature for solo forest rides though it too requires a smartphone connection.

It’s possible to grab routes and GPX data from third party services like Strava or by emailing a file to your phone and opening it in the Bryton app. Navigating saved routes is possible using the GPS alone which is what most mountain bikers will want to do.

Bryton made the Rider S500 compatible with countless devices including their own heart rate and wheel-based speed sensors. I was even pleasantly surprised to find that my Garmin GPS watch can share its heart rate data with the S500 flawlessly. That’s proof I suppose that it is possible for everyone to get along after all.

One cool feature (or possibly just a failsafe measure) is the S500’s ability to resume tracking after the device has been turned off. Often a dead GPS means a lost ride file at worst or an incomplete one at best. During testing I had the S500 set to turn itself off after a period of inactivity which usually coincided with post-ride drinks at the local pizza joint. Pitchers drained I was able to turn the power back on and resume the ride as if nothing happened.

By pairing the Bryton Rider S500 to your smartphone and the Bryton app you can get text and call notifications on the unit though understandably there’s no way to respond directly. The Bryton app stores details about your rides and the interface is pretty basic compared to others like Strava or even the Garmin app. Curiously I couldn’t find a way to share any of my rides via the Bryton app. I ultimately plugged the unit into my computer and grabbed the .fit file I needed. While the app should keep a record of every ride the device is only able to store data from the most recent rides or about 300 hours of ride time according to the spec sheet.

Accuracy

I didn’t conduct a full-on track test with the Bryton Rider S500 so I can’t speak in depth about its accuracy. The GPS helpfully has a setting to adjust the polling frequency between once every four seconds or once per second. I tested on the once per second setting for maximum accuracy and detail.

On an incredibly tight and twisty trail that’s known to be almost exactly two miles long the Rider S500 reported a distance of 1.44 miles. To put that in perspective I’ve had GPS units record anywhere from 1.0 miles to 1.7 miles for this trail so that’s not a bad result.

Bottom line

The Bryton Rider S500 raises the bar for the brand though sadly the experience falls a bit short for me due to the hard-to-see in-ride breadcrumbs. That’s a shame too given how well the GPS works with other devices and how responsive the touchscreen is even when wearing gloves. Priced at $299 (available at Amazon) the Rider S500 costs the same as the similarly fully-featured (though not touch screen) Garmin Edge 530.

Summary Buy Garmin Venu 2 Plus Good Extensive tracking capability

Huge accessory ecosystem

Solid build quality Bad No LTE version available

More a sports watch than a smartwatch

No ECG Garmin Venu 2 Plus Garmin Venu 2 Plus: All deals

Design and display The Garmin watches in the mid- to upper price range are well-made there is no question about that. Thanks to incremental upgrades the Venu 2 Plus is a little bit more solid and chic than its predecessors. What I liked: Solid and lightweight build.

Great AMOLED display.

Good wearing comfort. What I disliked: Bezel offers very little protection for the display. The Venu 2 Plus features an excellent build quality as usual as per other Garmin devices. The lightweight case tips the scales at just 51 grams and features a stainless steel back and fiber-reinforced polymer at the sides. The bezel is also made of stainless steel and is flush with the Gorilla Glass 3 display. This makes the front look very minimalistic and smooth but it also increases the risk of scratching the screen. I would recommend a screen protector in any case. Garmin Venu 2 Plus Screen Protector (3 pack) The round 1.3-inch AMOLED display has a resolution count of 416 x 416 pixels. The screen is sufficiently bright and absolutely legible under all light conditions at least that's what I discovered during my time spent with it. The always-on display is deactivated by default. Turning the wrist reliably turns on the screen. Apart from the touchscreen the Garmin Venu 2 Plus now has a trio of buttons on the right side for various functions. The buttons are made of plastic and feature a clean press. I never had problems with accidental activation during sports not even when the back of the hand touched the buttons during push-ups and the like. The Venu 2 Plus got a new button. The function of the middle button is freely selectable / © NextPit A silicone wristband is included with the Garmin Venu 2 Plus. It is suitable for wrist circumferences that range from 12.5 to 19.0 cm and feels very comfortable to wear. I did not have any problems with skin irritations during the review period.

Ease-of-use and smartwatch features The Venu 2 Plus uses the same operating concept as the first Venu and also many other Garmin watches before it. The way it works still serves it well in 2022 but the Venu 2 Plus looks a bit old-fashioned compared to Apple and Samsung. What I liked: Robust and flexible operating concept.

Now compatible with Siri Bixby and Google Assistant. What I disliked: Smartwatch features that hail from 2019. The operating concept of the Garmin Venu 2 Plus is quickly understood even for a new user. When vertical the user swipes through a series of so-called ""glances"". These are small widgets such as data from past workouts and sleep patterns notifications or the Spotify music control for instance. The widgets shown here and their order can be customized according to your preference. You begin a workout with a short press on the upper button. The Venu 2 Plus first displays your personal workout favorites and you can access the complete list with but a tap. A long press on the upper button leads to a configurable dialog of quick settings and features for example to adjust the display brightness find your smartphone control music playback or have a live reading of your heart rate. If you swipe up or down from the home screen you get to various widgets / © NextPit The lower button is the back button and always takes you back by one level. A long press on the button launches the watch settings. Most of these settings can also be found far much more conveniently via the Garmin Connect app on your smartphone. You can assign a specific function for the new center button for both tap and the long press actions. You can also choose between music control save current position alarm clock stopwatch timer brightness Garmin Pay call list dialer contacts volume or no function at all. Apart from the buttons and touchscreen the Garmin Venu 2 Plus now also supports voice assistants: namely Bixby Google Assistant and Siri. Depending on the voice assistant a few settings on the smartphone are required for this to work properly. This worked well with Siri in the review. However the integrated speaker is relatively weak whenever the surrounding sound is loud. In turn this will affect the response from the watch. Phone calls via the watch are also more suitable when you are in a quiet environment. Nevertheless my conversation partners could understand me excellently via the watch even while I was washing up in the kitchen. Notifications are less communicative though: The Venu 2 Plus displays all notifications from the smartphone or only text messages or calls. However it is not possible to reply via the watch or only via the voice assistant. Thanks to the speakers (and microphone) you can also make calls using the Garmin Venu 2 Plus. The speaker (fortunately) is not enough to fill a subway car with sound. / © NextPit Finally there is Garmin Pay which allows you to pay via the watch itself. As with its predecessors the Venu 2 Plus also has a fall detection feature that can not only alert your emergency contacts but it will also call them. It is a shame that Garmin does not offer the Venu 2 Plus with an LTE option.

Tracking & Training Tracking and planning training sessions happen to be Garmin's main discipline  and the Venu 2 Plus knows which side its bread is buttered on even if it does not follow the ECG trend in 2022. What I liked: Unbelievable number of tracking options.

Huge range of accessories from Garmin.

Precise optical heart rate monitor. What I disliked: No ECG function. Outdoor sports & GPS Sports and outdoor activities are Garmin's signature disciplines. Whether you run hike bike or swim Garmin has an extensive range of accessories for the Venu 2 Plus. There are optional waterproof chest straps as well as speed and cadence sensors for cycling or temperature sensors. And of course the Venu 2 Plus also offers an integrated GPS sensor to precisely measure your outdoor activities. Acquiring a GPS signal was really quick. The localization was complete before I had finished lacing up my running shoes indoors. Garmin HRM Premium Heart Rate Monitor Chest Strap Black Garmin Temperature Sensor for the Fenix Outdoor Watch Garmin 010-12843-00 Speed Sensor 2 Black Garmin Cadence Sensor And even while running the GPS sensor delivers precise data regardless of where you are. Even when you are on small forest trails the results are still coherent. For example if I run the same route several times the individual paths are a few meters apart at worst. In the screenshot below you can see a path recorded simultaneously using the Garmin Venu 2 Plus and the Fitbit Sense. Where the two trails meet on the Venu 2 Plus I actually walked across the same intersection in the woods twice. The Garmin Venu 2 Plus offers detailed evaluations of the runs (left). However the advanced running metrics such as vertical movement when running are only available on the Forerunner and Fenix models with the appropriate chest strap. On the right you can see the GPS recording of the Venu 2 Plus and the Fitbit Sense in direct comparison. / © NextPit Heart rate measurement while running works great as it does for all sports with very little wrist involvement. The Garmin Venu 2 Plus detected an average pulse of 158 beats per minute after a 24-minute test run. With a Sigma heart rate belt I measured an average of 160 and the Fitbit Sense came in at 156 beats per minute. As is typical for optical heart rate sensors the Garmin Venu 2 Plus also has a hard time with high pulse ranges. The Sigma watch measured a pulse of 178 at its peak while Garmin came in at a maximum of 170. Indoor sports & fitness Let's continue with the pulse rate during indoor sports. As soon as the wrists are heavily strained or bent its precision decreases. If the workout contains a lot of push-ups or dumbbell training the Venu 2 Plus drifts a bit further away from the chest strap and records heart rates that are typically too low. During a dumbbell workout for the arms and shoulders with rather lighter weights the Garmin watch achieves exactly the same average heart rate as the Sigma chest strap. The Fitbit Sense also detected a too low result with 109 versus 113 twice. The difference becomes greater for chest and back training with body weight or heavier dumbbells although the Garmin Venu 2 Plus always performs better than the Sense in this area. 7636 kilograms in 46 sets: If you divide the sets at the push of a button the Venu 2 Plus will reward you with a detailed training evaluation. / © NextPit However aside from the pulse rates the Venu 2 Plus also offers detailed workout tracking for exercises and weights. You can divide the sets during the workout by pressing a button and taking note of the weights. The Venu 2 Plus counts the number of repetitions in a relatively reliable manner and even automatically recognizes most standard exercises. You can correct the number of repetitions directly during the workout and the exercises in the app afterwards. Here you also get an automatic evaluation of which muscle groups you have trained. Training plans from A to Z Last but not least you can not only track your training with the Venu 2 Plus but also plan it in advance. For example there are training plans for running for which you can enter distance and optionally also time goals or a competition date. You can then select a trainer or the corresponding training philosophy and the Garmin Connect app generates your running plan. Various professional athletes and Olympians are the ones behind these running plans. When you put together a running plan you first enter the most important key data. You can then choose between different training philosophies which the respective trainers will present in a video. Ready? Then the runs end up in your calendar. / © NextPit There are also predefined workouts for general fitness training which range from full-body workouts to Pilates and yoga to the obligatory ""Hollywood"" body plan. The workouts can be filtered by type (HIIT strength yoga cardio Pilates) difficulty muscle groups goals and duration. You can then put together a complete workout plan from the individual units and even create your own workouts to go with it. The Venu 2 Plus offers numerous ready-made workouts that you can use to create a training plan. Alternatively you can also put together your own workouts. The catalog of exercises is endless and offers crazy ideas - one-armed push-ups on a medicine ball? phew You can store maximum weights for the standard exercises and track your progress. / © NextPit You can then send the workouts of your choice to the smartwatch and start them at any time you like. I find it somewhat unfortunate that there are currently only complete training plans for cyclists and runners but not for yoga. You have to piece together your own calendar here. Unfortunately there are no aids such as repeated workouts (i.e. Leg Day every Monday). Sleep & Recovery When it comes to sleep tracking the Garmin Venu 2 Plus offers standard fare. It determines the total sleep duration and the associated sleep phases. You can also see your breathing rate and blood oxygen saturation during the night. This may indicate snoring and sleep apnea. Slept well? Then you fill up your ""Body Battery"". The value is displayed on the watch's home screen and is intended to quantify your current fitness level. / © NextPit Incidentally almost all data can also be extracted from the app as a PDF. This comes in handy if you want to pass this on to your doctor. The three dots at the top right also always contain detailed explanations of how the individual measured values on the respective screen are to be interpreted. What else is missing? In view of this gigantic list are there any missing parts in the watch's specifications? Upon closer inspection: yes. While ECG sensors are now standard on Samsung Fitbit and Apple devices you can only find them on Garmin's new Fenix 7 series models. However this feature should not play a major role for the vast majority of users. The Garmin Connect app only shows rudimentary nutritional data (left). To log your food and see the macronutrient distribution for example you have to switch to MyFitnessPal (middle right). / © NextPit Another thing that you might want to take note of would be nutrition tracking. If you were to click on the calorie tile in the Garmin Connect app you will see a rough overview of the food entered in MyFitnessPal. However you have to switch to the app to check out other details such as macronutrients. And at least in the free version MyFitnessPal is unfortunately a very annoying app to use due to the number of ads and requires a premium subscription to access the full range of functions.

Battery: It keeps on going! The Garmin Venu 2 Plus offers an impressive battery life. Even with intensive use it lasts well over the week. Only when you take blood oxygen saturation measurement into account it reduces the battery life significantly. What I liked: Long battery life.

Charges from 0 to 100 in 90 minutes. What I disliked: No wireless charging.

Proprietary charging port. You rarely have to worry about battery life with the Garmin Venu 2 Plus. Even with an always-on display SpO2 tracking one hour of exercise per day and fully activated notifications the battery lasts anywhere from two to three days. If you were to choose not to use the 24-hour SpO2 tracking or the always-on display battery life is typically doubled - or longer if both options are disabled. In the review I charged the watch to 100 percent at 5:00 p.m. on Monday. With Always-On display and one hour of exercise daily (with and without chest strap) the 10 percent warning came at 11:00 on Friday morning along with the suggestion to activate the energy-saving mode. The charging connector with its four pins is proprietary but it is used in many Garmin watches. / © NextPit Unfortunately charging only works via cable which is also proprietary. At least Garmin uses the same port for the Venu 2 Plus as for many of its other Venu Vivoactive or Fenix models. As a result there are countless fancy charging dongles and charging stations that cut a much better figure on the table than the included cable that looks terrible when stuck at the bottom of the watch. Thankfully charging is quite a speedy affair: After 35 minutes the battery is half-full and after about 90 minutes it is filled from 0 to 100 percent.

An Amazon worker stole more than £4000 worth of Garmin watches after falling on 'desperate' times following the collapse of his arranged marriage.

Mohammed Aslam was caught by fulfilment centre security staff with one of the devices strapped around his ankle. A further ten watches were recovered from his car.

The 24-year-old from Hockley then avoided police for three months until they stopped him driving a Mercedes despite the fact he was banned from the roads.

Aslam admitted theft by employee driving whilst disqualified driving without insurance and possession of cannabis.

Appearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Friday January 21 he was told he faces the prospect of prison as District Judge Amar Mehta ruled his sentencing powers were insufficient.

Aslam was rumbled whilst working at the Amazon warehouse at Lyons Park in Coventry on September 5 last year.

Prosecutor Syeda Ahmed said: ""At 11.28am he was spot-checked by company security staff. As he tried to leave the premises he was subjected to a scanning device.

""He was found in possession of an electronic tablet concealed in his clothing. A Garmin smart watch was attached to his ankle. A further search of his vehicle revealed a further ten Garmin watches.""

The total value of stolen goods all of which were recovered was £4420.

The court heard Aslam was released without arrest but failed to attend a voluntary interview. Police stopped him driving on Moseley Road Birmingham on December 5.

Alexandra Youster defending stated Aslam was 'completely ousted' from his family after he sought a divorce from a marriage arranged for him as a teenager.

She said: ""He was living away from the family support network and found himself completely cut off. He was struggling severely. Financially he found himself in a terribly desperate place. He made a reckless and impulsive decision.

""He thought of Amazon as a large company and there would be no knock-on consequences. He does now appreciate the consequences and he is extremely remorseful.""

Miss Youster added her client did not realise he was disqualified from driving when police stopped him in December.

Aslam of Goode Avenue also falls to be sentenced for separate driving offences committed in March last year which were proved in court in his absence at a previous hearing.

(Image: Birmingham Mail)

Judge Mehta stated the 'starting point' for the theft was one year's imprisonment which was beyond his maximum sentencing powers of six months for a single offence.

He committed the case to Birmingham Crown Court to be heard on February 18 and added: ""He was stealing watches which were supposed to go to those who have ordered them. That's the whole point of Amazon.

""Members of the public order a watch from Amazon Amazon fulfils that delivery of that watch but this defendant intercepts that and steals that watch. That's what he did.""

You can choose each of these to dive into more details around your tracking data. Select Sleep to see your sleeping patterns including deep sleep light sleep REM and wake time along with your Pulse Ox data.

Select Calories to see a history of calories consumed broken down by calories you burned at rest and calories burned during your activities.

Two unique health stats that the Garmin Instinct smartwatches calculate and track are Stress and Body Battery. We’ll explore each of these in more detail in the next section.

Stress and Body Battery Health Stats

There is a variety of data that Garmin uses to calculate these stats for the app charts and history.

Stress Level : If your Garmin smart device supports the stress feature it will measure the variability of your heartbeat throughout the day. Since your nervous system regulates time between each heartbeat a very steady and predictable heartbeat means you’re experiencing less stress. More variability means more stress.

: If your Garmin smart device supports the stress feature it will measure the variability of your heartbeat throughout the day. Since your nervous system regulates time between each heartbeat a very steady and predictable heartbeat means you’re experiencing less stress. More variability means more stress. Body Battery: Like the Stress stat Body Battery is also calculated using heart rate variability but it also incorporates stress and your activity levels to calculate your body’s energy stores at any given moment during the day. This is rated from 1 to 100%. This calculation is eerily accurate.

These two unique stats go a long way toward helping you manage your daily stress levels and ensure that you’re getting enough rest to accomplish what you want to achieve every day.

By: Paula Levin

Parenting teenagers is not for the fainthearted. It’s brutal thankless confusing painful scary and often heartbreaking. My mother in law tried to warn me when my kids were little – “It’s not all coochi-coo.” Boy was she right! The worst part is that we’re flying blind. I don’t know about you but I never got a manual and I literally don’t know what I’m doing. Fortunately as a writer I get to research explore and investigate the world and speak to people who know more than me. I hope you and I can learn the easy way what so many have learned the hard way.

Teens are struggling

“In my 15 years as a social worker I have never seen acting out like this” says Lisa Klotz who works with teens at King David Schools. “Teens’ lives have been turned upside down through this pandemic making what is already a very difficult life stage so much harder.” Lisa contextualises this challenge within a broader developmental stage described by Erik Erikson as identity vs role confusion where teens struggle with figuring out who they are and where they fit into the world. “Between Covid losses trauma and social isolation they have been disproportionately affected by this pandemic. Some are struggling to reintegrate into social groups and many are grappling with depression and anxiety. Constantly hanging over their heads is the fear that they will make their loved ones sick! It’s a lot to bear.”

Rabbi Gartner is a family educational counsellor who specialises in education crisis management and works with families around the world. “Teens in South Africa have particular challenges different to teens in other countries. Stuck behind high walls and spending all their time on devices they have very little independence very little freedom very little responsibility and very little accountability. We do everything for them from making their arrangements and appointments to driving them where they need to go and picking them up. This can be a blessing because they can’t just disappear and live on their own when they clash with their parents. They can’t cut them out because they are totally dependent on them so this buys us some time to get things right” he points out.

“The first step to helping teens through this challenging time is to see where their struggle is. Is it sensory? Are they too inactive? Can we help by taking them to the gym or working out with them at home? Maybe they need help regulating their use of devices – and that needs a discussion on taking breaks on how screens can be addictive.” Rabbi G explains that their bodies are raging with hormones while they are more sedentary than they have ever been before. “We see a seesaw effect the more still the body is the more overactive the brain is” he explains. “But maybe the struggle is in the relationship with the parents. Are we as parents trying to control them? Because for example we are sociable and like to interact with people do we expect them to be the same? Do we allow the possibility that they are different people to us? When they don’t conform to our values like in the way they dress does this trigger our own shame? In pushing our values do we push them further away from our values?” he asks.

“The world has changed. And that means we have to change” says Lisa whose work at King David is inspired by Brené Brown author and professor at University of Houston’s graduate school of social work. Brené’s thinking is shaping how the schools deal with teens testing boundaries. “While our code of conduct has not changed how we deal with consequences has shifted” Lisa explains. Brené Brown teaches a critical distinction between guilt and shame. Guilt says: “I did a bad thing” shame says: “I am bad”. Most importantly no one will be publicly named and shamed – that’s old school. If any disciplinary process is required this happens with the student’s counsellor and it happens within the clear context that the student is still held in high esteem they have incredible potential they are intrinsically good and that they can come back from whatever behaviour was inappropriate.” Lisa believes it’s vital to send the message that vulnerability and failure are ok. “It’s ok not to be perfect it’s ok to make mistakes in fact it’s encouraged! That’s how leadership ability is nurtured by daring greatly and taking risks.”

Separating between behaviour and essence has strong roots in Jewish thought and is a particularly important point to remember when dealing with teen misbehaviour or outright rebellion. Famed psychiatrist Rabbi Dr Avraham Twerski (obm) once shared that when he did something inappropriate as a young boy his father would say to him “is pas nisht” – meaning it doesn’t fit it’s unbecoming it doesn’t suit you. Such lowly behaviour doesn’t live up to such a lofty individual. This leaves the child’s self esteem intact while not glossing over the room to grow. When a teen is shamed it can affect his core belief about himself and when this inner spark is lost so is all motivation to do any better – with sometimes tragic consequences.

Sam and Kerry Hurwitz* believe that just such a process happened to their oldest daughter Tammy who moved schools multiple times before grade 8. Diagnosed and heavily medicated for various learning difficulties and presenting with behavioural problems Tammy heard the message loud and clear over and over – she was defective she was ineducable she was a failure and a disappointment. Unwittingly unconsciously her parents colluded with her teachers – assuming there was something fundamentally wrong with their daughter. “When she refused to go to school in grade 8 I gave up. I was so tired of fighting and trying. She was nothing like I thought she would be and should be but I couldn’t see then that that was ok” Kerry says. What followed was a year of partying with the wrong crowd drinking and smoking marijuana. “I was totally embarrassed by Tammy I couldn’t control her I couldn’t make her just be normal.” As Rabbi G explains every child wants to make their parents proud but if they feel that’s impossible they choose rather to be naughty than a failure.

Kerry even looked into sending Tammy away. “I was at my wits end; I didn’t want her to be part of our family. But I was strongly advised to keep her at home at all costs. That sending her away would turn marijuana into heroin to medicate the pain of total rejection. And that could destroy her.” After a year of aimlessness things finally shifted. Tammy was blessed with a mentor in the form of her dancing teacher who offered a steady diet of affirmation focused on what Tammy could do not her deficits. This was an avenue where if she worked hard she would see results. The frustration and futility of years of school melted as Tammy tasted mastery. A tiny seed of self esteem blossomed unexpectedly. “One day I had a surreal experience where I suddenly was sick of my life the way it was. I was sick of my friends I could see they were destructive. I took a long hard look at my life and who I was and I didn’t like what I saw. I asked myself if anything I was doing was even making me happy” Tammy reveals. Her inner resilience kicked into high gear. She cut off communication with her friends and started practicing dancing for hours a day determined to qualify as a dancing teacher.

At the same time her parents found an alternative approach to education that was more learner-centred where Tammy had the space to find what interested her without all the negative and critical messaging. It was a shift from compliance toward curiosity and creativity from a climate of command and control toward a climate of possibility. On her own given the space to live life on her terms Tammy realised it was in her own interest to finish high school because she wants to pursue a career as a psychologist. Now intrinsically motivated she is finally thriving academically. Much more than this she is open to life curious about bettering herself and best of all she is deeply connected again to her parents.

Get to know your teen

For me Tammy’s miraculous story is a lesson in acceptance of who our children are and curiosity about their passions and potential. We need to pay close attention to our children’s essence to their interests and talents. The biggest mistake we can make as parents is to believe that our children are a blank slate onto which we can imprint our aspirations and expectations. “I truly thought that our children come into the world and we have to teach them our language” says Kerry. “I learned the hard way that they have a language of their own and it’s my job to learn it.”

This is profound. Our children are each gifted with a unique soul – in the words of Jewish mysticism “a literal piece of G-d on high”. They have incredible wisdom beauty and radiance to share with the world. Yes we must teach them right from wrong and give them the boundaries that create the safety to explore without harming themselves or others – but fundamentally we must respect their individuality their separateness and personhood. They are not there to make us proud to give us nachas. “Our children are not a reflection of ourselves. They are unique people who reflect their own choices” says Rabbi G. Indeed they are on their own journey as described so eloquently by Lebanese poet Kahlil Gibran who said “Your children are not your children…They come through you but not from you And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.” What then is our role as parents?

Help them grow into greatness

Of course we are not mere facilitators or benevolent witnesses to our children’s lives. We have a crucial job to do and that is to pass on our values. As Jewish parents those values are rooted in the Torah and encompass its magnificent vision for humanity with respect and love for one another as its central principle. “Our job as parents is to teach our children our values. It’s not our job to make sure they accept them. Hashem gave them free will how can we take that away from them?” asks Rabbi G. This was quite the mind shift for me! I guess I had thought I should use any means necessary to enforce my rules. But as my teens get older it gets harder to “make” them do anything and punishments and consequences have begun to feel inappropriate and downright authoritarian!

“It’s not about control it’s about respect” Rabbi Gartner says. And respect begins with a real relationship. “You can’t form a proper relationship without trying to learn about who your teen is as a person how he or she thinks what’s important to them. Your child needs to feel heard. Before resorting to rules have a discussion about what you need hear what your child needs. Negotiate. Talk about various solutions and finally explain your boundary.”

A deep and positive relationship is the most powerful tool you have to influence your teens so it’s vital to feed that relationship. “Respect for your values is what will help a teenager set boundaries for themselves when they are out of the house and are faced with temptations and risks that go against the values of the home” says Rabbi G. “I suggest that parents spend regular one-on-one time with their teenager. And make sure they know it’s not because they’re in trouble just that you want to get to know them better. I doubt that they will reject this. They might not want to do it over a coffee at a restaurant. Maybe restaurants are unpleasant for them. Get curious. Ask for their ideas and solutions.”

This relationship is something you have hopefully been building all their lives. But many of us have been chipping away at that relationship with a relational style that doesn’t respect the child and sometimes that needs to change. “I’ve done a lot of introspection as a person since Tammy began to self destruct” says Kerry “and I realised that I had some things all wrong. I learned the value of horizontal communication over vertical top-down communication. This is where we don’t tell our children what to do we share our thoughts and they share theirs and it’s not a power struggle. I spent so many years telling my kids “because I said so” and devaluing their thoughts and opinions. People get very uneasy at the thought of horizontal communication as if that gives children too much power. But really what it does is acknowledge our equality that we are both human beings with ideas and perspectives and preferences that can be explored and negotiated together. Horizontal communication turns instructions into conversations.”

A loving relationship doesn’t preclude boundaries but boundaries are not about controlling the other person as much as standing firm about your values. “I tell parents that they don’t have to know everything their teen is doing outside the home. If they smell like they had a cigarette don’t even ask them about it. Don’t turn natural experimentation into something they need to assert their identity or make a statement about their independence. Ignore it. But in your home communicate what your boundaries are what your values are and ask them to respect those values while they are in your home. The stronger the relationship the more they will respect those boundaries.”

Rabbi G says that many parents have a hard time maintaining their boundaries because they are afraid of their children’s emotions. “We seem to think that happiness is the only acceptable emotion and if our children feel angry or sad about our boundaries then we must change them.” Parents also compromise their boundaries because a rejection of their boundaries feels too much like a rejection of themselves. They can’t tolerate the feeling that their children don’t like them. Rabbi G points out that our ability to securely defend our boundaries gives teens the strength to honour theirs.

So as much as raising teens is about teens it’s about us as parents. It’s about looking at our expectations and our reactions and seeing how they affect the young people in our lives. But managing difficult teen behaviour is not all there is to the story. Our goal is not carbon neutral – our goal is empowering teenagers to become their very best selves and transform the world in the process. “Because teens in South Africa have so little freedom they have very few responsibilities. This is not healthy for them. We need to give them opportunities to be accountable.” For example if they want to be fetched at a certain time we need to give them the responsibility to let us know in advance. And if they don’t then we need to let them face the consequence that they might have to wait. As parents we need to let them feel the consequences even if they are a little painful – but obviously not if they are very harmful or dangerous. This teaches responsibility and accountability.

“We also need to cultivate a culture of respect in our families – of saying please and thank you to our children so that they too learn to express courtesy and gratitude.” Modelling the behaviour of the kind of humans we want them to become is the best way to teach our values says Rabbi G. “If we see people in need we need to step up and help them. Not assume that ‘the community’ will come to the rescue. If we want to raise young people who create a whole new kinder and better world we need to step up and make a difference right now. This is how they learn that they have the power to change things to impact others. It’s up to us to teach our teens by our own example that if we want to live in a certain kind of world we have to create it. We each have the ability and talent to make a difference.”

On children

By Kahlil Gibran

Your children are not your children.

They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.

They come through you but not from you

And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts

For they have their own thoughts.

You may house their bodies but not their souls

For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow which you cannot visit not even in your dreams.

You may strive to be like them but seek not to make them like you.

For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.

The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.

Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;

For even as He loves the arrow that flies so He loves also the bow that is stable.

Friday showed some promise but only managed a slight increase.

Most of the bullish action was in corn and soybeans with South America returning to hot and dry conditions amid already falling production estimates. Soaring palm oil prices also helped lift soybean oil and soybeans into new highs.

For the week Kansas City wheat was up 9¢ Minneapolis down 16¢ and Chicago up 6¢. Both corn and soybeans scored new highs for the move with corn up 20¢ and beans up 56¢.

While fundamentals are bullish for wheat part of the reason it is struggling to keep up with row crops is it is the short leg of spreads by hedge funds and other large traders. They will be long corn and beans but spread the risk by being short another grain and that pretty much means wheat.

Record wheat production in Argentina and Australia had a bearish impact on the market from late November to early January. That supply is now absorbed into prices and the market will focus on Northern Hemisphere supply for the next couple months and then attention turns to the growing season for winter wheat.

Demand has picked up over the last week with wheat export sales a market year high of 737 TMT just above the range of estimates. Year-to-date sales sit at 17.4 MMT down 21% from last year. The sales pace sits at 78% of USDA's estimate 6 percentage points behind the average. Corn sales were also strong at 1.2 MMT; year-to-date sales are 43.9 MMT down 10% from last year. The corn sales pace sits at 71% of USDA's estimate 8 point ahead of average. Soybeans export sales last week also totaled 1.2 MMT; year-to-date sales sit at 79% of projections 1 percentage point behind the average.

Egypt was back in the market on Friday purchasing 420 TMT. They took 180 TMT from Ukraine 120 TMT from Romania and 120 TMT from Russia (clearly not too concerned about supply disruptions from the Black Sea). They paid $347 - $350/MT CIF about $12/MT lower than their most recent purchase last month.

I would expect to see U.S. export sales continue to pick up. With most Southern Hemisphere supplies spoken for buyers will need to source from the tighter supplies of the Northern Hemisphere. And obviously if war breaks out between Russia and Ukraine supplies will likely get much tighter as Russian sanctions kick in and Ukraine port disruptions become probable. We don't want to see fighting in the Black Sea but it would be very bullish for wheat corn and feed grains.

While we're keeping one eye on demand and war potential the other is turning toward weather – particularly in hard red winter wheat country from Texas to Montana which is pretty much about as dry as it gets along throughout the Plains. This week the central Plains got a shot of snow that will help a little but it is a long way to breaking dormancy when the crop will need a good drink.

Bottom line look for more upside price action with plenty of volatility. Seasonals usually see grains put in a high in early February around the crop report. If that happens I think it presents a pricing opportunity. We'll likely see another normal seasonal rally into early May as the battle for acres should be in full swing for spring planted crops.

A&T honors late Dr. Ronald E. McNair in 36th Celebration,"N.C. A&T honored the late NASA astronaut and Aggie alum Ronald E. McNair by hosting a live- streamed event celebrating 36 years since his passing. Students and Alumni came together to celebrate the impact McNair had on their lives.

McNair was a trailblazer in his own field by becoming one of the first African American astronauts. The Aggie alum didn’t stop there McNair would later become a mission specialist astronaut for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Space Shuttle Program.

Unfortunately on Jan. 28 1986 he was aboard the Challenger for his second mission when it experienced malfunctions and crashed within 73 seconds. McNair died along with six other crew members.

Many McNair scholars were inspired by his work and contributions to science. Although some students may believe his work might be a tough act to follow.

Charles Cooper III is a senior mechanical engineer student with a concentration in aerospace who chose engineering because he enjoyed design. As a kid building things and hands-on activities came naturally to Cooper. So choosing N.C. A&T was not a hard decision for the soon-to-be graduate.

“I chose A&T because it was the number one public HBCU for engineering and they also had aerospace[as an]option which fit perfectly for what I was going for” Cooper said.

Cooper like McNair put a lot of time into his craft as he got experience in his field with three internships while being in college. He received two internships with GE Aviation and Apple where he learned to always be open to learning and networking.

Senior physics student Joshua White believes that McNair inspired him to be courageous and to go for companies such as NASA.

“Dr. Ronald McNair taught me that I shouldn’t be afraid to pursue majors like physics. I shouldnt be afraid of STEM in general.

The normal procedure uses water under pressure while the motor rotates without having to be turned on there is even a specific device which is attached to the motor spinner as we can see in the video below.

https://youtu.be/pPxC83dMnQc

However Japan Airlines (JAL) is implementing a new method from GE Aviation applied for the time being in the CF34 engines of the Embraer E170 and E190 aircraft. This uses foam and avoids wasting fuel and water in the process.

The 360 ​​Foam Wash technology which uses foam can save up to 82000 liters of fuel per year according to GE and represents up to 285 tons of carbon that will not be emitted per year into the atmosphere.

According to GE 360 Foam Wash can also be used on several GE engine programs including the GE90 GEnx CF34 and CF6 engine families.

“In conventional water cleaning water is atomized and sprayed onto the engine compressor but in foam cleaning a special heated foaming cleaning agent is injected into the engine to chemically remove dust and dirt particles inhaled during flight” told JAL.

Also keeping a clean engine is an advantage for airlines. The particles that remain inside disturb the aerodynamic part and add weight to the components causing a 1 to 2% higher consumption of fuel when in this condition.

JAL's regional subsidiary J-Air operates a fleet of 18 E170s according to Cirium fleet data. The airline also operates a fleet of 14 E190 regional aircraft which are also powered by CF34 engines.",,,,,,,,,

The bloom is off the rose for Netflix which has dropped some 40 percent in value ever since Wall Street decided that the former hyper-growth technology platform has become something decidedly less sexy: a maturing cash-positive media company. As my partner Matt Belloni recently wrote this is more than just a correction as part of the broader Nasdaq sell-off. Investors are afraid that more competition and weakening subscriber growth portends a harder more costly path forward. So naturally my friend Bill Ackman the hedge fund investor has stepped forward to buy the dip.

Ackman’s thesis is simple: the Netflix stock is oversold. On Friday January 21 Ackman’s firm Pershing Square Capital Management began accumulating more than 3.1 million shares—a position worth more than $1 billion. From a recent low of around $354 a share on January 24 the stock has rebounded to around $384 a share potentially giving Ackman a profit of some $90 million already. (He has not disclosed the average purchase price on his 3.1 million shares.) In a letter to his investors Ackman praised Netflix for its strong recurring revenue “best-in-class” management team formidable “pricing power” and the possibility of “substantial margin expansion” over a growing—albeit somewhat less rapidly than desired—subscriber base.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNTQwNTYwL2FkdmFuY2VkLXZpc3VhbGl6YXRpb24tbWFya2V0LWlzLWJvb21pbmctd29ybGR3aWRlLXNpZW1lbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advanced Visualization Market is Booming Worldwide | Siemens Healthineers GE Healthcare Fujifilm Holdings,"Advanced Visualization Market is Booming Worldwide | Siemens Healthineers GE Healthcare Fujifilm Holdings

When TikTok creator Boman Martinez-Reid first got an email from Creative Artists Agency he ignored it. As an Ontario native he saw the acronym CAA and assumed it was CAA Insurance a major car insurance company in Canada. It was only after a TikTok representative contacted him that he realized he was being courted by one of Hollywood's top talent agencies. ""I get a [direct message] from a guy at TikTok and he says let's talk on the phone"" Martinez-Reid recalled. ""So we had a phone call and he asked me 'I know that CAA has been reaching out to you. Do you know who they are? They represent Beyonce Meryl Streep you have to get on the phone with them.'"" Martinez-Reid known online as ""Bomanizer"" has more than 1.5 million followers and a budding career that includes a guest appearance on ""Canada's Drag Race"" and a line of branded merchandise. While he rose to TikTok fame making reality show spoof videos the 24-year-old has aspirations beyond the social media platform. He signed with CAA in July 2020. Martinez-Reid is part of a growing list of content creators that have signed with traditional talent agencies including dancer Charli D'Amelio actress Addison Rae and the creators of the viral TikTok series ""The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical"" Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear. These artists have been tapped because of their talent but also because of their engagement with online communities. These entrepreneurs have built large and loyal followings on the short-form video app something talent managers and agents from traditional Hollywood firms see as a potential gold mine. Not only can these agencies help build mini-media empires around these creators they also can benefit from the strategies these digital influencers use and apply it to bolster the careers of the agencies' already established clients. Actor Will Smith who is repped by CAA is just one example of an A-list celebrity who has embraced social media including TikTok and YouTube  in recent years as a way to promote his content and to promote himself. ""Will recognized four or five years ago that young audiences are consuming media in a much different way"" said David Freeman co-head of the CAA's digital media division. ""Will understood that he had to shift and change the way that he was interacting with his audience."" This pivotal audience which ranges in age from six to around 25 is known as Gen Z and is one of the most sought after consumer bases for companies. Not only is this young generation coming of age as consumers but they are also driving major trends for older generations said Jason Dorsey president of the Center for Generational Kinetics a research and strategic advisory firm. ""This makes this younger set of trendsetters overly valuable"" he said. This generation is not just impacting entertainment but apparel food technology and bigger social conversations he said. ""As Gen Z comes up they really are the best predictor of the future"" Dorsey said. ""Smart brands are trying to figure out how you connect with them in a sincere way. … If you win Gen Z you can win everyone else.""

Embracing Gen Z

Dorsey noted that many brands missed out on connecting with the millennial generation because they dismissed this demographic's adoption of mobile devices and social media and believed that this group of young consumers would return to the traditions of previous generations. ""That didn't happen"" he said. While the millennial generation adopted the internet and a mobile-first mentality Gen Z has never known a time that they could not do almost everything they needed to do on a mobile device said Connor Blakley a marketing consultant and Gen Z expert. ""Everyone always says that Gen Z has a six- to eight-second attention span"" he said. ""What that is is just a really good 'BS meter' for different kinds of information so that we can pick the thing that we really want to spend time on."" Blakley who is a member of Gen Z himself has advised companies like Pepsi Johnson & Johnson and the National Hockey League on social media marketing strategies. He noted that Gen Z is a generation that can easily discern when people and companies are being disingenuous. ""That's why you are seeing talent agencies marketing agencies influencer agencies all kinds of branding agencies going to TikTok because that is the place where Gen Z already is"" Dorsey added. ""If you want to reach them you have to go to where they are because you have virtually zero chance of getting them to where you are."" TikTok in particular has been a place for talent agencies to cull new talent because of its rapid rise to popularity and the viral nature of its content. In fact TikTok was the most popular website in 2021 surpassing even Google  according to data from Cloudflare a web security and performance company. The social media app which launched internationally in 2017 rose to prominence in 2018 but really gained traction with consumers in late 2019 and during the coronavirus pandemic. Movie theaters were shuttered productions of popular TV shows were halted and the rate at which content was being released to the public slowed considerably. With so many people stuck at home many turned to alternatives like TikTok for entertainment. ""Suddenly there was a pandemic"" Martinez-Reid said. ""Everyone was stuck inside. I had nothing to do but to make content and everyone else had nothing to do but to watch content.""

Boman Martinez-Reid known on TikTok as ""Bomanizer"" is a content creator who was signed by talent agency CAA in July 2020. Boman Martinez-Reid

For Martinez-Reid TikTok was a creative outlet. He was one semester away from graduating from Ryerson University's RTA Media Production program when the social media platform began to gain popularity. So he decided to try his hand at content production. ""What do I have to lose? If I post something and it does well great. If it does poorly then no one will know"" he said. His first TikTok was posted in December 2019 and centered around Martinez-Reid having a conversation with his last two brain cells about joining the social media platform. ""I was just basically shooting for this like overproduced super scripted try hard kind of edge which at the time was not a thing on TikTok"" he said. ""And I think that's why my content started to do so well because I started to get this comment that was like 'I can't believe that this is a TikTok' and from then on it sort of just snowballed into more and more opportunities."" Martinez-Reid has become known for his reality show spoof videos in which alongside family and friends he pokes fun at how cast members often get into feuds over the small things. He said that during the pandemic while people were stuck inside they could relate to tiny little frustrations bubbling over into big arguments. While Martinez-Reid has yet to break into Hollywood he's used his relationship with CAA to meet with casting directors and story producers at various networks over the last 18 months. His goal is to gain more knowledge about the industry so he can make more strategic decisions about what projects he wants to sign on for in the future. But there is a path for Martinez-Reid one that was first forged more than a decade ago by content creators on YouTube and the now defunct video platform Vine.

'Talent is talent'

Over the last decade CAA has helped content creators from nontraditional platforms make the transition to Hollywood. The group reps Tyler Blevins aka Ninja who rose to fame streaming himself playing video games. While Blevins continues to play video games professionally he has also participated in Fox's ""The Masked Singer"" and had a cameo appearance in Disney's ""Free Guy."" The talent agency also represents Arif Zahir who gained notoriety for his impressions posted on YouTube and now voices Cleveland Brown on Fox's ""Family Guy."" Other notable celebrities that have risen from this space include CAA-signed Justin Bieber who was discovered by Usher and Scooter Braun and became a Grammy Award-winning artist; Liza Koshy who also signed with CAA and now voices Zipp Storm on the ""My Little Pony: A New Generation"" TV show; and Bo Burnham who is represented by United Talent Agency went from making comedy YouTube videos to writing directing and starring in top Hollywood films. ""Talent is talent"" said Frank Jung who launched CAA's digital media division almost a decade ago alongside Freeman. ""If they are an amazing talent that's just number one."" TikTok is still a relatively new platform and has yet to produce the same number of Hollywood success stories as YouTube has in the last decade but experts predict it won't be long until its making a mark on the film and television industry.

Already we've seen the rise of Addison Rae 21 who secured a multimillion dollar deal with Netflix in September after starring in the streamer's film ""He's All That"" a sequel to 1999's ""She's All That."" She is represented by William Morris Endeavor Entertainment and currently has more than 86 million followers on TikTok. And of course Charli D'Amelio 17 who touts a following more than 133 million strong on the social media platform has partnered with brands like hummus maker Sabra Procter & Gamble and Dunkin and now has her own docuseries on Hulu. D'Amelio is repped by UTA. Then there is Maggie Thurmon who rose to fame on the social media app dancing and performing circus tricks with her father Dan. The 19-year-old was signed by UTA in February 2020 before she hit 1 million followers on the platform. Now she has more than 5 million followers a popular podcast called ""Mags and Dad's Wholesome Chaos"" and just wrapped her first feature film ""The Other Zoey"" which features Andie MacDowell and Heather Graham. ""I'm auditioning at the moment"" Thurmon told CNBC just hours after finishing up on set. ""I'm so excited for the possibilities of acting in the future. If I can do this for the rest of my life I would just be the happiest person on the planet."" Thurmon said she was ""greatly surprised"" when she announced to her TikTok following earlier this month that she would be pursuing acting alongside her burgeoning social media career. ""I prepared for the backlash"" she said. ""But I did not find one negative comment on the TikTok announcement or Instagram post."" Thurmon's experience is not unique. ""What we see is that Gen Z influencers on TikTok have built meaningful followings and have a built-in audience of fans that feel a personal connection to the creator and want to be more supportive"" Dorsey said. ""They feel like that are going along with them on the project."" That's one reason these content creators have clout among Hollywood agencies looking to sign fresh talent.

'Data is the new oil'

""The unique thing is not only being able to identify talent but this talent already comes with a built-in audience"" CAA's Freeman said. ""Through social media and these platforms there is a direct conversation that is happening between talent and audience."" For Jung and Freeman these audiences provide much needed data about what people want to consume for content and who they want to see make that content. ""Data is the new oil"" Jung said. ""What we are trying to do is make sure we are amplifying these voices and eventually creating media businesses for the clients which will leave lasting legacies."" ""And also everyone can make some money"" he added with a laugh. Not only can these agencies help build mini-media empires around these creators they also can benefit from the strategies these digital influencers use and apply it to bolster the careers of the agencies' already established clients. Smith who has been campaigning for a best actor nomination at this year's Academy Awards for his role in Warner Bros.' ""King Richard"" is a prime example of a traditional CAA client who has used social media to jumpstart the next phase of his career. Freeman said that some of the actor's learnings and best practices came from Koshy who emphasized that his social media videos didn't need to be perfect well-produced videos they just needed to be authentic and give audiences a peek behind the curtain into his life. Smith started his own YouTube channel in 2017 posting vlog-style videos about his life alongside curated series. 2018's ""The Jump"" focused on Smith's preparation to bungee jump out of a helicopter over the Grand Canyon for his 50th birthday while 2021's ""Best Shape of My Life"" centered on the actor's journey to improve his personal fitness. More recently he has posted videos of himself training alongside Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa quizzing his young costars from ""King Richard"" about his career and explaining how he went about recording his audiobook.

""His career was colder than it had been"" Dan Weinstein of Underscore Talent said. ""I wouldn't say it was nonexistent but he was not the 'Independence Day' blockbuster draw he was. He found new audiences. He reinvented his persona around his celebrity. There's no denying the fact that he is an insanely creative talented charismatic individual and he's leveraging that to breathe new life into all of his endeavors."" In the last five years Smith has starred in major blockbusters like Warner Bros.' ""Suicide Squad"" and Disney's ""Aladdin"" reestablishing himself as a force at the box office. And Smith isn't the only celebrity following this path. Dwayne Johnson Ryan Reynolds Taylor Swift Jennifer Lopez and more have embraced social media as a way to connect with fans and promote their work. Jung and Freeman's digital media division of CAA has been devised as a place to meld the best practices of the traditional Hollywood model with the strategies of grassroots entrepreneurial content creators. In doing so their team can take already established talent and reinvigorate their careers. They can also take up-and-coming talent like Martinez-Reid and build from an already sturdy foundation. Martinez-Reid is still forging his path and CAA isn't rushing him. ""That's why I love CAA"" Martinez-Reid said. ""Because they see me as a talented creator who will have a career. It's not just about quick jobs. It's about shaping what my next 10 years are going to look like.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjkvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svaG93LWNvb2tpZS1iYW5uZXJzLWJhY2tmaXJlZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Cookie Banners Backfired,"The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in business.

From Washington to Brussels policy folks are focused on digital privacy. Just this week three states and the District of Columbia filed a series of lawsuits against Google accusing it of violating consumers’ privacy rights. Dozens of bills have been introduced in Congress to force companies to develop digital tools that help users manage their privacy. And companies spend billions of dollars to comply with — or skirt — the labyrinth of complex privacy laws that already exist.

It just so happens that this week is known as Data Privacy Week.

But there’s an inconvenient truth about all the effort that has gone into creating and enforcing digital privacy safeguards: When it comes to the most extensive internet privacy rule yet the public doesn’t seem to care — or more accurately it doesn’t seem to have the knowledge or tools to effectively benefit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy93ZC1ibGFjay1zYzU3MC1zZS1yZXZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WD Black SN750 SE SSD Review: Cost-Effective Storage for Gamers,"WD’s Black SN750 SE is a decent-performing gaming-oriented SSD. While it doesn’t deliver the best PCIe 4.0 performance it competes well against many of the best PCIe 3.0 SSDs on the market and is listed at competitive prices.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

WD's Black SN750 SE' Special Edition' delivers sequential speeds of up to 3600/2830 MBps read/write but it is hardly faster than the best PCIe 3.0 SSDs which is curious given its PCIe 4.0 connection. However the SSD is priced to sell making it a great option for value seekers on the hunt for one of the best SSDs for a gaming rig.

Equipped with a Phison DRAM-less SSD controller and BiCS4 96-Layer TLC flash the SN750 SE's secret sauce is a mix of cost-efficient components clever marketing and low prices. While the DRAM-equipped SN750 excels in heavy workloads with its somewhat power-hungry eight-channel PCIe 3.0 controller the DRAM-less SN750 SE is better optimized for low-budget gaming builds with its four-channel PCIe 4.0 controller and newer flash although it still holds its own quite well when pressured with requests.

The special edition naming might indicate that this drive is an impromptu stopgap solution between the older SN750 and not a true replacement. Either that or it could be part of the company's attempt to optimally use up their last batches of BiCS4 TLC flash as it introduces newer BiCS5-equipped SSDs like the Blue SN570 we recently reviewed.

The WD Black SN750 SE is available in 250GB 500GB and 1TB capacities and is listed at very competitive prices ranging from $0.11 to $0.20 per gigabyte. Although it communicates over a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface the SN750 SE is only rated to deliver sequential speeds of up to 3600/2830 MBps read/write and sustain upwards of 525000/640000 random read/write IOPS at its highest capacity. The smaller capacities aren't quite as performant.

WD backs the SN750 SE with a five-year warranty and endurance ratings similar to the standard WD Black SN750 equating to 600TB of write data for our 1 TB sample. Leveraging the Phison SSD controller the SN750 SE features a fourth-gen LDPC engine SmartECC and end-to-end data path protection to ensure your data's integrity from when it's written until you retire the device. Similar to the SN750 it also lacks SED capability but fortunately that's not a big deal for most gamers. Trim secure erase support via the Format NVM command and SMART data reporting also come standard.

Like Samsung Magician WD’s SSD Dashboard is one of the best SSD toolbox softwares available. With it you can monitor your SSD's health and performance in real time upgrade the firmware if applicable and even enable gaming mode which disables all lower power states so that the SSD is always ready to perform optimally. WD also provides Acronis True Image for Western Digital so you can clone over your existing data to your new SSD.

A Closer Look

The Black SN750 SE comes in a single-sided M.2 2280 form factor so not only is it compatible with all desktop gaming systems it's also compatible with many of the best Ultrabooks too.

The Phison PS5019-E19T that powers the SN750 SE may lack DRAM but it isn't without some tricks to mitigate that. Instead of reading and updating directly on the flash itself it utilizes Host Memory Buffer (HMB) tech that grants the SSD's controller some of the host system's DRAM for the task. This feature offers improved performance with accelerated access to the metadata while only taking 64MB away from the host.

The controller features an ARM Cortex-R5 primary processor and leverages Phison's CoXProcessor Technology which means it has an additional dual-core co-processor to handle some of the firmware workloads. The controller is produced on TSMC's 28nm technology node. This isn't the newer 12nm node that Phison uses in some of its products but it still keeps fairly cool under load with features like power state management. Just in case it's needed thermal throttling will kick in if the SSD exceeds 84 degrees Celsius.

A single NAND package on our 1TB sample is filled to the brim with older generation BiCS4 96-Layer TLC flash. While this dual-plane flash is responsive it isn’t quite as fast as the quad-plane BiCS5 in newer drives. The controller supports transfer rates of up to 1200 MTps per channel but likely runs at Toggle 3.0 speeds of up to 800 MTps a limitation of the flash.

Ice-T know him as a hard-core gangster rapper or a police officer but now he is helping people get healthy with Cheerios.

Rapper Actor Producer and rockstar Ice-T can now add Cheerios to his burgeoning résumé.

The artist is now the face of Honey Nut Cheerios by teaming up with the breakfast brand to help people become more healthy. Specifically want people to exercise more and consider overall wellness more this year.

The cereal giant which is owned by General Mills announced they will launch a new initiative called “Pour Your Heart Into It” where Ice-T and the Cheerios mascot Buzz Bee coach individuals trying to improve their health.

“This stuff doesn’t have to be hard. It can be as simple as a bowl of Cheerios and a walk around the block” Ice-T explained. “That’s why I wanted to join Buzz to share some different ways to start to get your heart pumping regularly and help make diet and exercise a happy part of your day.”

The goal is to get the body moving the heart pumping and also enjoying the health benefits of a bowl of Cheerios.

Fans can join Coach Ice-T on Pandora as he narrates the 4-minute walking stretching core strengthening and dance “Pour Your Heart Into It” workouts which are accessible via QR code on the back of the limited-edition happy heart shape boxes. “Cheerios has always been a delicious and heart-healthy choice and our limited-edition happy heart shapes are designed to remind everyone that taking care of your heart can be fun too” said Kathy Dixon senior brand experience manager for Cheerios. “This year we’re taking it a step further with our partnership with Ice-T to inspire a change of heart around how people think about both diet and exercise. Instead of a chore these can actually be some of the best moments in your day.”

Ice-T has not quelled his explicit oftentimes controversial nature on social media. The Hip-Hop maverick is now a household name.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9nbS10by1tYXNlcmF0aS1ob3ctbmotcG9ydHMtaGFuZGxlLW1vcmUtdGhhbi00MDAwMDAtdmVoaWNsZXMtZWFjaC15ZWFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LOOK: NJ ports handle more than 400000 automobiles each year,"Foreign-made cars have to get here somehow and straight to New Jersey from overseas isn't the automatic path for all of these vehicles.

But with the offer of financial incentives and a seemingly-robotic process in place to handle everything moving in and out the Port of New York and New Jersey is one of the top gateways in the country for vehicle imports and exports.

""In 2021 through November we handled over 425000 automobiles"" Mike Bozza assistant director of commercial development for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told New Jersey 101.5. ""We are in the center of probably the largest consumer market in the world.""

Terminals in Newark and Jersey City are the port's hubs for this around-the-clock activity. Vehicles come over on so-called ro-ro vessels (the cargo is rolled on and off not shipped in containers) which are essentially floating parking decks.

""Some of then have up to 14 levels and they can carry over 8500 cars"" Bozza said.

The ports handle vehicles made by nearly all of the major players in the automobile business from Ford and Nissan to Maserati Ferrari and Polestar.

According to a blog post by PANYNJ the seaport's history with vehicles dates back more than six decades beginning with Foreign Auto Preparation Service Inc.'s move to Port Newark.

Today the port continuously ranks among the nation's top five pathways for vehicle exports and imports. Bozza said the port offers financial incentives to automakers that attract more volume to the Garden State.

Once an incoming vessel is docked a streamlined process unloads the vehicles into the auto processing facilities where workers inspect the vehicles and make other adjustments before the vehicles are shipped to dealers throughout the country.

""Certainly a vast majority of the vehicles that come here stay in this market"" Bozza said.

The terminals are also recipients of outgoing cars that make their way to New Jersey from spots such as Canada and the Midwest.

New Jersey woke up Saturday morning to double-digit snowfall along the coast but New Jersey 101.5 Meteorologist Dan Zarrow said at 9 a.m that we had ""turned the corner"" with snowfall expected to taper off through the afternoon.

While the threat of coastal flooding subsided Saturday morning additional light snowfall and drifting snow from the wind could continue to be a problem Zarrow said.

""It's a statewide event but the shore is getting clobbered the most"" Gov. Phil Murphy said Saturday morning during The Big Joe Henry Show on New Jersey 101.5.

Murphy on Friday declared a state of emergency and urged residents to hunker down on Saturday and stay off the roads. He told Big Joe that most people heeded that recommendation.

Murphy said more than 3000 pieces of road equipment were deployed across the state but the drifting snow would impede the progress of snow clearing into the afternoon.

See below for the snowfall totals so far on Saturday morning.

The blizzard conditions brought below-freezing winds but the state's utility companies were only reporting a smattering of power outages Saturday morning: JCP&L had about 600 customers without power Atlantic City Electric another 266 and PSE&G just a half dozen before 9:30 a.m.

The roads however were a different matter with slow-moving traffic and commercial vehicle restrictions on the state's interstate highways. Garden State Parkway remained snow-covered between the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway.

The region's airports canceled hundreds of flights Saturday morning. (Newark EWR info | Philadelphia PHL info | JFK info | LaGuardia info | Atlantic City info)

NJ Transit also suspended its bus services Saturday morning. Service was expected to resume Sunday morning. Rail service continued with weekend schedules.

The storm was expected to dump snow from Virginia to Maine with parts of Massachusetts expecting as much as 30 inches.

In November she was in the backseat of an electric GMC Hummer EV that President Biden was driving accelerating from 0-60 mph in the 1000-horsepower monster truck's WTF (Watts to Freedom) mode in a parking lot outside a GM factory. More recently she took a spin in a very different electric car.

She and GM President Mark Reuss were visiting San Francisco to check out the autonomous ride hailing vehicles being developed by the company's Cruise subsidiary and were chauffeured around the city in fully autonomous Chevrolet Bolts with no one behind the wheel.

In a Cruise-produced video Barra demonstrates requesting a car via a smartphone app and then gets in with Cruise founder Kyle Vogt.

As the car pulls away Barra calls the experience ""incredible"" and says she wished she wasn't wearing a mask because she couldn't stop smiling.

""A lot of people have asked me 'Well how are you going to get people to use it?’ It's like OK we were in the vehicle for five minutes and the trust is there"" Barra said.

""I always believed that we'd be doing it but to actually be doing it is just surreal.""

In his car Reuss remarked how the technology will open doors for people who can't drive themselves or are aging like his 85-year-old father Lloyd Reuss who once served as president of General Motors.

Cruise first began offering the fully driverless service for company employees and some outside customers last November but has not yet gained approval to launch a public commercial service. Barra has previously said Cruise is aiming to do so sometime in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDEvMzAvYmlkZW4tYWxseS1idWlsZC1iYWNrLWJldHRlci1vcHBvbmVudC0wMDAwMzQ0ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Biden ally takes over one of Build Back Better's main opponents,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/30/biden-ally-build-back-better-opponent-00003448 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDEvMzAvYmlkZW4tYWxseS1idWlsZC1iYWNrLWJldHRlci1vcHBvbmVudC0wMDAwMzQ0ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wMS9maXZlLXdheXMtZ20taXMtaW5mdXJpYXRpbmctaXRzLWN1c3RvbWVycy10b2RheS_SAVlodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjIvMDEvZml2ZS13YXlzLWdtLWlzLWluZnVyaWF0aW5nLWl0cy1jdXN0b21lcnMtdG9kYXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five Ways GM Is Infuriating Its Customers Today,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://gmauthority.com/blog/2022/01/five-ways-gm-is-infuriating-its-customers-today/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wMS9maXZlLXdheXMtZ20taXMtaW5mdXJpYXRpbmctaXRzLWN1c3RvbWVycy10b2RheS_SAVlodHRwczovL2dtYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjIvMDEvZml2ZS13YXlzLWdtLWlzLWluZnVyaWF0aW5nLWl0cy1jdXN0b21lcnMtdG9kYXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNicy5jb20vc2hvd3MvdmlkZW8vRzFDXzE4S3VVWjgxRGlJOFVnQmNDQnVGZ0ZuM2E0TkYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch CBS Evening News: General Motors plans to spend billions on electric vehicles - Full show on CBS,"3min

The collaboration will accelerate the growth of rewards and incentives throughout Southeast Asia and provide solutions to the APAC businesses that are revisiting their rewards strategies as a result of the pandemic.

With Blackhawk’s investment Wogi will now be able to offer a wider selection of gift card rewards which have shown to be effective incentives for driving loyalty and motivation among shoppers and employees alike1.

“This investment will provide Blackhawk with greater access to digital-first rewards incentives and gift card content in the APAC regions such as Singapore Hong Kong Malaysia Thailand the Philippines Vietnam and Indonesia and provide Wogi with a more robust corporate framework benefiting from Blackhawk’s vast gift card network and solutions” said Mark Singer managing director of Asia Pacific Blackhawk Network. “Digital rewards are highly popular in the APAC region and there are numerous applications for organizations to leverage these rewards. For instance businesses can leverage smart rewards and incentives to help boost topline revenue and streamline business processes by building engagement and boosting employee partner and customer satisfaction.”

To date Wogi powers rewards for more than 300 B2B and B2C companies with more than 700 gift card content and payment partners. By joining forces with Blackhawk Wogi’s clients in APAC markets will have access to an even larger rewards portfolio — including original gift card content personalized for individual recipients — via its smooth CONNECT API and digital integration technology for seamless ordering processing and delivery.

“With Blackhawk’s backing we will have the opportunity to expand our offerings and seek out growth opportunities for our business and our clients’ businesses” said Pavlina Atanasov Wogi Founder and Senior Vice President. “Robust modern reward programs can create significant competitive differentiation for organizations jockeying for valuable market share and by expanding our capabilities we will help our partners — and our company — tap into the latest and greatest reward options.”

1 “BrandedPay: How People and Brands Connect Through Payments” is based on the findings of an internet-based survey conducted by Leger on behalf of Blackhawk Network between February 12–March 17 2020. The sample size included over 12000 respondents in eight countries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZ2ZtYWcuY29tL2F3YXJkL3dvcmxkcy1iZXN0LXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1maW5hbmNlLXByb3ZpZGVycy0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World's Best Supply Chain Finance Providers 2022,"SCF is no longer a luxury that only the largest suppliers can afford.





Last year was a memorable year for supply chain finance (SCF) for many reasons. At the start of the pandemic in 2020 buyers began extending membership in their SCF programs to small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) a trend that continued well into 2021.

However last year’s collapse of Greensill Capital brought some unwanted attention to the little-known and opaque world of SCF.

Lex Greensill former head of SCF at Morgan Stanley founded his firm in 2011. The company lasted until March 8 2021 when it filed for insolvency due to one of its primary insurers pulling the plug on credit insurance for the firm’s debt portfolio.

Most SCF is done on a confirmed basis. But in the case of Greensill authorities alleged that the firm was providing financing against future receivables that might or might not have ever materialized which many have described as a form of unsecured lending.

In the wake of Greensill’s collapse the industry expected unwanted regulatory attention to rear its head; however a UK parliamentary report Lessons from Greensill Capital recognized no need to “bring supply chain finance within the regulatory perimeter for financial services.”

Nonetheless Greensill’s example highlights the need for greater transparency in SCF. Much information regarding SCF deals and programs is not readily available. As SCF grows and looks to attract a wider pool of investors and as it supports more-complex financing structures the need also grows for greater transparency to bring more clarity and certainty. This is particularly so for those companies that rely on SCF to ship and supply goods and services without a 60- 90- or 120-day wait for payment.

Transparency is even more critical as SCF becomes a haven for nonbanks and fintechs looking to disrupt the field by leveraging the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain and tokenization—or serving a niche such as SMEs that large global trade banks typically overlook.

Certainly Global Finance’s annual SCF awards reflect the changing mix of providers now entering the SCF market. It is tempting to be dazzled by shiny new pieces of technology and ways of doing business that many new tech-savvy entrants to the field claim they deliver. But it remains critical to keep in mind the need to balance the technology hype against other factors such as a provider’s safety and security reputation and market standing.

It is equally important not to dismiss the innovation and work some of these newer entrants bring. They may not have the track record or experience of firms that have offered SCF for decades. Still they have identified a niche that is not currently well served by the usual SCF providers and can be better addressed with newer technologies and business models.





Although long-standing SCF providers continue to invest in their offerings and want to help clients to digitalize more aspects of their supply chains there is no question that much of this innovation and investment wouldn’t be happening at its current scale or pace without the competitive threat posed by those newer tech-savvy entrants.

This year’s award winners are a mix of the old and the new and a celebration of those that bring not only financing and a pool of investors or even technology’s newest bells and whistles but also a willingness and ability to adapt their services to suit the needs of companies seeking faster and more-affordable forms of financing.

As the SCF market matures many now realize that one size does not fit all and that a wide range of solutions and approaches are needed to address the differing and varied needs of suppliers at every stage or tier of the supply chain.

Among the winners of this year’s Global Finance Best Supply Chain Finance Providers there is a growing recognition that SCF needs to benefit all parts of the supply chain. It’s no longer a special solution for only the largest suppliers in key markets according to Orbian but also provides early liquidity to suppliers in more-vulnerable countries.

Add into the mix a global pandemic that caused significant demand and supply shocks in global supply chains and cash shortfalls for companies that have had to endure months of disruption and lockdowns and we have the kind of perfect storm that allows SCF to flourish and potentially realize its full potential. Despite these recent developments there still exists the trillion-dollar trade financing gap. But a meaningful shift reflected in the achievements of this year’s winners is underway as new solutions enable all tiers of the supply chain to benefit from early payment for goods or services provided.

Methodology: Behind the Rankings

Global Finance editors select the winners for both the Trade Finance Awards and the Supply Chain Finance Awards with input from industry analysts corporate executives and technology experts. The editors also consider entries submitted by financial services providers as well as independent research taking into account a set of objective and subjective factors. This year’s ratings which cover 102 countries and eight regions were based on performance during the period from the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021.

It is not necessary to enter in order to win but experience shows that the additional information supplied in an entry can increase the chance of success. In many cases entrants are able to present details and insights that may not be readily available to the editors of Global Finance.

The winners are those banks and providers that best serve the specialized needs of corporations as they engage in cross-border trade. The winners are not always the biggest institutions but rather the best: those with qualities that companies should consider most carefully when choosing a provider. Global Finance uses a proprietary algorithm with criteria—such as knowledge of local conditions and customer needs financial strength and safety strategic relationships and governance competitive pricing capital investment and innovation in products and services—weighted for relative importance. Each entity is rated on each separate criterion. The algorithm incorporates those ratings into a single numeric score with 100 equivalent to perfection. In cases where more than one institution earns the same score we favor local providers over global institutions and privately-owned over government-owned institutions.

GLOBAL WINNERS

BEST SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROVIDER — BANK

Citi

Winning the global award for Best Supply Chain Finance Provider–Bank is not just about the number of markets served or the number of supply chain finance programs a provider supports. With one of the largest transaction banking networks Citi boasts encouraging metrics on both counts. But more important especially during a pandemic is its ability to scale and implement its services quickly as supply chains adjust to the new business norms.

Liquidity remains a significant portion of any SCF program and Citi’s global reach permits it to source liquidity from its balance sheet or a pool of investors. A noteworthy addition to the bank’s SCF toolbox is its Dynamic Discounting offering which it launched in Europe and the US. The service enables buyers to make cash more readily available to mid- to long-tail suppliers where demand for financing is typically the greatest.

BEST SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROVIDER — NON-BANK

Orbian

Fintechs in SCF come and go but Orbian founded in 1999 by Citi and enterprise-software provider SAP continues its mainstay status. The company focuses on supporting buyer-led SCF programs via innovations such as Express SCF that are designed to make SCF accessible to all suppliers regardless of their size or location.

Alongside its traditional SCF programs which Orbian offers in more than 50 countries Express SCF facilitates early payment in more than 100 countries. The fintech also recently launched a fixed rate offering—an alternative to pricing programs based on Libor or other floating-rate mechanisms—that lets suppliers lock in a rate on any discounts for up to five years. It is 20 years’ worth of collected data permitting better risk modeling that makes such a service possible according to Orbian.

BEST CUSTOMER IMPLEMENTATION

DBS Bank

Leveraging its digital-first strategy and application programming interface (API) suite Singapore-headquartered DBS Bank helped renewable-materials provider Stora Enso monetize its growing accounts receivable portfolio and remove costly inefficient and paper-based processes for managing its incoming receivables. As the company’s days sales outstanding (DSO) had doubled from 60 to 120 days with growing cross-border transactions its finance team were spending more time physically matching invoices and custom and tax declaration forms with their corresponding payments. This gave them little visibility on the status of incoming payments.

Using a combination of DBS Bank’s Supplier Payment Services providing automatic and selective payments for suppliers; its digital supplier onboarding tools; and its DigiDocs offering the bank made the customer journey entirely paperless for Stora Enso. The vendor’s financial team used DBS’ digital corporate banking platform and Swift gpi for cross-border payments to trace incoming payments from buyers in real time.

The bank also set up a digital accounts receivable purchase program to ease the impact that Stora Enso’s widening DSO had on its working capital and to increase its cash conversion cycle so that the company could be paid quicker.

“Teams on both sides worked very well and effectively together to guarantee a smooth process and quick implementation and ramp-up all around” says Wei Li-Tuomela vice president and head of Treasury at Stora Enso.

BEST PROVIDER OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE SOLUTIONS IN SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE

ASYX

Sustainability may be a current buzzword in finance but it does not always easily translate into action for small and midsize enterprises (SMEs). For one thing many systems that track sustainability as goods and services move through global supply chains are often geared for larger companies. The mission of Southeast Asian supply chain integration firm ASYX is to facilitate faster business expansion for SMEs using various forms of supply chain financing and to help them better understand and integrate sustainability into their systems.

With a strong focus on agroindustry and forestry value chains ASYX is well positioned to support sustainable financing initiatives that lead to real change. In Indonesia it supports environmental efforts to preserve rural peatlands and mangroves. In the apparel sector it is helping SMEs that produce natural yarns and fibers in rural areas to scale up their business and become more agile.

BEST BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCING SOLUTION

FQX

Describing itself as “the first market-ready solution for eNotes” which are unconditional promises to pay specific sums to other parties on a selected date FQX combines an old concept with new technology in the form of its Swiss Trust Chain. This is a private blockchain from Swisscom and Swiss Post that incorporates a patent-pending authentication mechanism which FQX says is based on regulated and qualified electronic signatures provided by Swisscom.

FQX’s eNote infrastructure can be integrated into the financing platforms of banks and fintechs “[allowing] for the standardized and globally scalable transfer of unconditional promises to pay radically facilitating supply chain and corporate finance” the vendor adds. For example companies can use eNotes to generate free cash flow improve working-capital metrics and ultimately replace inefficient and costly paper-based trade and supply chain finance processes.

BEST NEW APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE

Vayana Network

With a focus on SMEs India’s Vayana Network leverages plug-and-play APIs data analytics and digital technologies to make it easier for companies of any size to participate in SCF programs.

For one fast-moving consumer-goods vendor assessing researching and servicing an extensive network of distributors proved to be time-consuming and expensive. However using real-time upstream data to identify creditworthy distributors Vayana provided financing offerings that ensured that just as much of the distribution chain would be covered.

Vayana’s platform offered the consumer-goods company a range of financing possibilities beyond standard reverse factoring including receivables securitization and a “specially structured last-mile retailer program.” In addition to its data analytics capabilities being the largest goods and services tax (GST) Suvidha Provider for API-based connections to India’s GST network for tax filing and e-invoicing also has its advantages says Vayana as it allows it to analyze data assess risk onboard partners and disburse and collect money quickly.

BEST DYNAMIC DISCOUNTING SOLUTION

MUFG

Dynamic discounting which enables buyers to use their balance sheets instead of banks provides suppliers with early payment in return for a sizeable discount on their invoices. It is typically dominated by fintechs. Nonetheless Japanese banking giant MUFG which entered US SCF following its 2019 acquisition of GE Capital’s Trade Payables Services platform is one of the few banking providers whose proprietary SCF platform supports standard SCF and dynamic discounting.

For one large US-based customer looking to improve its working-capital metrics across different business units in various countries MUFG proposed a solution that combined a receivables purchase program for its largest suppliers and dynamic discounting for its remaining suppliers. According to the bank the dynamic discounting service delivered a yield of 12% APR and $50 million to $60 million in “realized supplier discounts” or reductions in the cost of goods sold year-on-year. In total the combined program realized more than $1 billion in cash flow benefits according to MUFG.

BEST PLATFORM CONNECTING BUYERS/SELLERS/FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

PrimeRevenue

The Atlanta-based software-as-a-service SCF platform provider PrimeRevenue connects more than 30000 customers in more than 80 countries. Its global funding network includes more than 100 partners and supports more than 30 currencies. The platform’s ability to tap into multiple funding providers has led customers to expand their SCF programs to reap the benefits of better financing availability.

A newly added function SurePay speeds up payments to suppliers by letting buyers consolidate their entire supplier base onto a single payment platform and eliminating the need to manage multiple enterprise resource planning (ERP) and payment systems.

BEST SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

riskmethods

Getting ahead of supplier risk issues that can crop up at any time in complex global supply chains is the holy grail for many companies. But in a business primarily based on a complex web of international relationships building in a certain level of predictability to warn companies how their suppliers could be affected by geopolitical economic or other risks is challenging at the best of times.

However Munich-based riskmethods’ Risk Intelligence engine eliminates much of the guesswork. The engine analyzes millions of data points from media and other sources to identify relevant supply chain threats in real time. Its offering processes more than 2.5 million potentially relevant risk indicators and conducts between 400000 and 500000 risk assessments per month.

How can companies distinguish between what is just noise and what is relevant? The platform’s Noise Cancellation feature alerts users to only the most critical information so that users are not bombarded with false alarms.

REGIONAL WINNERS

AFRICA

Standard Bank

Few banks understand the intricacies of trading in local African markets as well as Standard Bank does. With a heritage of 160 years in the region and a robust sub-Saharan network the bank possesses an in-depth knowledge of local market regulations and customs. Leveraging the strong trading ties between Africa and China Standard Bank was also one of the first African banks to forge a relationship with a Chinese bank namely the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China which acquired a controlling interest in the bank in 2015. Their partnership lets customers in the Africa-China trade corridor benefit from the bank’s structuring and technology expertise. Standard Bank works closely with companies in the oil and gas sector structuring solutions that improve working capital and liquidity metrics while assuming the credit and market risk from receivables purchasing programs. The bank even supports holistic solutions integrating SCF with logistics management.

ASIA-PACIFIC

DBS BANK

Much of DBS’ success in growing its SCF business in the Asia-Pacific region can be attributed to its efforts to be a digital-first bank. This not just about how many markets it is in throughout the region—although that’s important—but also the bank’s expansive API suite. At last count the suite had more than 200 corporate and institutional banking APIs with almost a third of them being trade related. Through APIs the bank can help customers transition to paperless trade more seamlessly by making it easier for the client’s ERP and trade systems to interact with bank systems in real time. Companies can submit documents and financing requests digitally with little or no manual effort resulting in faster processing times and greater visibility across a transaction’s lifecycle.

A digital-first mindset and a comprehensive suite of APIs mean DBS can also partner with fintechs looking to disrupt the trade and supply chain finance industry more readily. Among the fintechs with which the bank has worked are AntChain a blockchain-based trade platform; and CredAble an Indian fintech that provides working-capital finance for SMEs.

CARIBBEAN

Scotiabank

Although Scotiabank has scaled back its presence in the Caribbean and Central America it still operates in 25 countries across the region with strong historical ties to key markets—such as Jamaica where it has supported trade since 1889. The bank has the aspiration to help its customers expand their business wherever they do business “across Canada into the United States the Caribbean and Central and South America” the bank writes in its 2021 annual report. “Our long history across the Americas has given us a deep understanding of how these countries operate the strengths of their economies and the aspirations of the people who live and work there.”

CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE

UniCredit

Instead of a one size fits all approach to SCF UniCredit uses in-house innovation and collaborates with fintechs to develop fully customized working capital offerings to meet the financing needs of its customers in Central and Eastern Europe. In Russia for example the bank devised a digital agent factoring service for accounts payable management to support the entire supply chain for a local manufacturing client. In Slovenia the bank structured a program that benefited buyers and suppliers—the buyers extended their payables while the suppliers received their payments sooner—despite the challenging time frames and an entirely new structure for the bank’s local branch. In addition UniCredit banking teams in different countries—the Czech Republic Germany and Romania—worked together with the help of a fintech to deliver a bespoke SCF offering for an international customer.

LATIN AMERICA

BBVA

The Spanish bank has provided local banking services in Latin America for more than 40 years and its SCF programs encompass core markets such as Mexico Peru and Colombia. In 2020 the region accounted for more than half of the bank’s overall profits. Moreover the region is of even greater value to the bank following the recent divestment of its US retail banking operations according to analysts. The bank has based the bulk of its SCF programs in Mexico and Peru where BBVA boasts a more than 20% market share. In 2020 BBVA launched its new cloud-based global SCF platform which provides a single point of access and full traceability of all invoices and payments. The platform supports payments in local currency in Mexico Peru and Colombia. In addition BBVA plans to roll out support for the Argentinian market later this year.

MIDDLE EAST

First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB)

As the largest banking group by assets in the UAE First Abu Dhabi Bank is one of the first banks in the Middle East to develop a fully automated SCF offering which is in production with several international customers and programs. Throughout 2021 the bank implemented various SCF programs collaborating with government agencies to support SMEs. It partnered with the Department of Finance in Abu Dhabi and health insurer Daman to provide a 6 billion dirham ($1.6 billion) SCF program to ensure rapid payment of receivables for SMEs in the health care sector. Other noteworthy deals include an Islamic SCF program that supports suppliers in the UAE and acting as co-lead arranger on a program supporting SME suppliers and corporates for one of the major members of the Gulf Cooperation Council.

NORTH AMERICA

Bank of America

With solid growth in its SCF portfolio in 2020 Bank of America witnessed continued growth throughout 2021. The North American corporate banking giant which invests billions in technology annually looks to compete with innovative fintechs in SCF by investing in APIs and data analytics to deliver greater operational efficiencies and insights to its clients and their suppliers. For example the bank now provides real-time payment status information directly to buyers’ ERP systems via APIs. Its Supplier Enablement Portal which the bank rolled out to North American customers in 2020 uses data analytics to analyze buyers’ spending with suppliers aiding supplier segmentation and prioritization of strategic suppliers for onboarding to buyer-led financing programs.

WESTERN EUROPE

BBVA

BBVA’s global SCF platform which it launched in 2020 enables customers to pay suppliers in up to 20 currencies. The new cloud-based platform is designed to make it easier for the bank to onboard the entire supplier base of creditworthy buyers without imposing any limits on the number of invoices or amount of financing. Buyers can also more easily track invoices and payments to suppliers. Given that its biggest markets are based in its European stronghold—where the bank is headquartered—and in South America the bank is geographically diversified enough to meet its European customers’ local or global SCF needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9wYXlwYWwtc3RhYmxlY29pbi13aGF0LWl0LWNvdWxkLW1lYW4tZm9yLXBheW1lbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal stablecoin: What it could mean for payments,"PayPal confirmed on Jan. 8 it is “exploring a stablecoin” that could be called PayPal Coin after a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin within the source code of the company’s iPhone app.

PayPal senior vice president of crypto and digital currencies Jose Fernandez da Ponte said at the time that if the company plans to move forward with the stablecoin it will do so while working closely with relevant regulators — an approach that could help the fintech firm avoid the wrath of United States senators that doomed Meta’s Diem cryptocurrency project.

The company has clarified that the source code found on its iPhone app was developed in an internal hackathon. When Cointelegraph contacted PayPal to learn more a spokesperson confirmed the previous reporting but did not offer any additional commentary.

The potential impact of a PayPal stablecoin in payments overall and in the cryptocurrency industry is hard to estimate and while some experts see the firm’s move as an extremely positive one for the space others believe the stablecoin would be more of the same.

Could PayPal Coin normalize crypto payments?

It’s clear that a traditional finance company moving into the cryptocurrency sector and launching its own stablecoin differs from a crypto-native firm launching a stablecoin. Traditional finance companies serve users who aren’t necessarily already dealing with cryptocurrency wallets or the volatility in this space.

PayPal itself has well over 350 million active users and already lets users in the U.S. and United Kingdom buy sell and hold Bitcoin (BTC) Ether (ETH) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) while enabling payments in these crypto assets. While it’s unclear how many of PayPal’s users have paid with cryptocurrency it’s well-known that stablecoins are mostly a tool used to trade and take advantage of opportunities in the decentralized finance space.

PayPal further pushing into the cryptocurrency industry through the launch of a stablecoin could see other traditional banking and payments companies explore blockchain technology more according to Marwan Forzley CEO of online payments platform Veem. Forzley told Cointelegraph that stablecoins will “likely become a part of the global payment scheme” as moving money in a secure environment with on- and off-ramps with different applications “is a major need of small businesses.” Forzley added:

“PayPal Coin could fuel general interest in payments overall. Consumers and small businesses alike are looking for a safe and reliable alternative to traditional currencies and payment networks.”

Max Galka CEO of blockchain search engine Elementus seemed to agree with Forzley’s assessment noting that with globally recognized platforms such as PayPal supporting cryptocurrencies stablecoins are immediately put in a “trusted realm for a large swath of the population.”

To Galka PayPal launching its own stablecoin would “definitely open up cryptocurrency to more people” who “have not had the inclination to really figure out this niche space.” Galka told Cointelegraph:

“Right now there aren’t that many well-established trusted organizations in this space where trust is such a critical component. PayPal would be one of the first major financial companies to embrace crypto.”

He said it’s a “very natural fit for PayPal to develop a stablecoin” as the move puts the firm “squarely on the map as a cryptocurrency company” which could boost its other cryptocurrency offerings while the trust people have in the firm could see PayPal Coin “serve a lot of additional purposes from what traditional stablecoins can offer by using that [trust] as their payment rails.”

Arbel Arif founder and CEO of crypto marketplace Shopping.io told Cointelegraph he applauds PayPal’s move into the crypto sectors and added that having “big players enhancing the e-commerce crypto transactions brings us a step closer to the new era of commercial trading.”

Speaking to Cointelegraph Tim Frost founder and CEO of wealth management platform Yield App said that cryptocurrency payments are “finding their way into the mainstream” as a “number of companies now allow digital asset owners to pay with digital currencies using standard Visa or Mastercard.”

To Frost whether or not PayPal launching its own stablecoin would jumpstart a transition to a more cryptocurrency payment-focused world isn’t clear although he does believe it has the potential to do so.

Not everyone agreed that PayPal Coin could be revolutionary however. Speaking to Cointelegraph Rytis Bieliauskas chief technology officer of cryptocurrency payment gateway CoinGate said he does not see how a PayPal stablecoin is “fundamentally different from what PayPal already does” assuming it’s “centrally controlled” and has its value guaranteed by the firm.

Bieliauskas added that it’s “interesting to see that PayPal wishes to use crypto as a positive PR move” which to him suggests the public now sees cryptocurrencies as something positive rather than negative.

Overcoming regulatory challenges

While PayPal made it clear it would be working with relevant regulators on its stablecoin if and when it moves forward with the project it will still have to overcome regulatory challenges because of the scope of its business.

That’s according to Eli Taranto chief business development officer at EQIBank — a licensed digital bank working with corporations and high-net-worth individuals. Taranto told Cointelegraph that PayPal’s geographical footprint will see it face “worldwide regulatory issues” when it comes to crypto which will “be quite interesting and a necessary challenge.”

To Taranto PayPal’s revenue coming from transactions means it will “have to connect as many tokens and chains as possible building faster better fully automated cross-chain instruments along the way.” He added:

“This may eventually serve as a catalyst for mass adaptation of crypto and give the crypto processing industry a boost as venture capital will begin to flow to this relatively new sector.”

Taranto said that if PayPal manages to appease regulators it will affect other institutions which will “see it as a sign that a path to global regulatory compliance has been created.”

Stablecoin issuers have notably not only faced scrutiny from regulators as the cryptocurrency community often pressures them to be as transparent as possible about the backing of their stablecoins. Launching a stablecoin will see PayPal deal with heightened scrutiny so it’s worth asking What’s in it for them?

How PayPal benefits from a stablecoin

Ultimately PayPal issuing its own stablecoin is an improvement to its bottom line. Caleb Silver editor-in-chief at financial information portal Investopedia pointed out that in the third quarter of 2021 transaction-related expenses cost PayPal $2.7 billion according to its most recent quarterly filing.

The use of a high transaction throughput blockchain like Solana could see PayPal save a very significant amount in transaction-related expenses. The firm currently does not allow users to buy or sell Solana (SOL) on its platform and on which blockchain it would deploy its stablecoin is unclear.

Speaking to Cointelegraph Jerald David president of digital asset investment firm Arca said PayPal is “uniquely positioned to adopt cryptocurrencies due to their captive client audience and because this potential product offering is an enhancement to their existing core business.” David added:

“By marrying the efficiencies of blockchain technology with their existing business model they can help instill and solidify the confidence of individuals and small businesses in the digital asset industry.”

To Arca’s president it’s likely that if people are going to end up adopting digital assets one day they’ll be doing so through a third party that has earned their trust just like PayPal.

What’s known about PayPal’s stablecoin plans is very little. Steve Moser the developer who found PayPal Coin’s code on the company’s iPhone app revealed later on that PayPal had references to stablecoins linked to the pound and euro within the application suggesting PayPal would launch various stablecoins linked to different fiat currencies.

What if PayPal Coin is something separate from Paypal’s USD stable coin? What if PayPal was also working on stable coins for the Pound and the Euro? #PayPalCoin $PYPL $PYPLUSD https://t.co/vyBmMCmp7f pic.twitter.com/qRJ0IrbBBJ — Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) January 10 2022

Shortly after PayPal Coin started making headlines however PayPal removed images for its euro- and pound-linked stablecoins. A reference to Neo within the code stayed suggesting it may also be on the firm’s radar.

The real impact a PayPal Coin may have will depend on the company’s implementation of the stablecoin. While it has the potential to ingrain crypto into traditional payment systems it also has the potential to be “just another” stablecoin. The best-case scenario is seemingly one crypto enthusiasts dreamed about years ago before Bitcoin traded in five-figure territory which shows just how far we’ve come in only a few years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYm9yZ2VucHJvamVjdC5vcmcvZ2VuZGVyLXdhZ2UtZ2FwLWluLWljZWxhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Closing the Gender Wage Gap in Iceland,"Iceland is a small island nation home to about 366000 people situated in the North Atlantic Ocean between Greenland and Norway. Owing partly to its small size Iceland has become a world leader in various social indicators such as gender equality and poverty reduction. For the 12th year in a row Iceland was crowned the most gender-equal country in the world by the World Economic Forum in its 2021 Global Gender Gap Report. Despite this top ranking it is still necessary to fully close the gender wage gap in Iceland and in turn alleviate remaining poverty within the nation.

Poverty in Iceland

The gender wage gap no matter how small can have a significant impact on one’s vulnerability to poverty. The gap between the earnings of men and women means that pay cuts unemployment and economic downturns more dramatically impact women which can and have historically led to increases in poverty in Iceland.

The poverty rate in Iceland is much lower in comparison to its Nordic neighbors with about 9% of Icelanders earning an income that falls below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold in 2018. In other Nordic countries this figure sits “between 12% and 16.4%” while the average in the European Union stands at 21.9% in 2020.

Another indicator of poverty the unemployment rate is also very low in Iceland standing at 3.9% in 2019. Further there is little disparity between the unemployment rate for men and for women. However there remains a difference in the employment rate with 88% of working-age men having a paid job in comparison to 83% of women. This difference links to roles of childcare and housekeeping which traditionally fall on women. However Iceland has robust subsidized childcare policies which lessen the burden of traditional gender roles and allow women to participate in the labor force more freely.

The Gender Wage Gap in Iceland

The Global Gender Gap Report finds that Iceland has closed 89.2% of its gender wage gap as of 2021 taking the lead as the most gender-equal country in the world. There is a strong culture around social safety nets and welfare in Iceland ensuring that gender and income inequalities are minimal. According to the OECD Better Life Index wage bargaining in Iceland helps promote income inequality and decrease poverty rates. In addition to this the government has implemented several policies in recent years with the intention of addressing the gender wage gap in Iceland.

Gender Equality Policies in Iceland

First and most well-known is the Equal Pay Certification the first policy of its kind in the world. This policy which went into effect in 2018 requires all companies with 25 or more employees to provide annual proof of equal pay for men and women. The policy previously only required companies to disclose information on wages but the government expanded it to further increase job satisfaction and transparency in the pay system. This one-of-a-kind policy is making strides to close what is remaining of the gender wage gap in Iceland.

Iceland also requires a near equal gender balance on the boards of all publicly traded companies and requires a certain percentage of employees to be of each gender. All companies with 25 or more employees must also disclose the gender composition of their employees — an initiative aimed at pressuring companies to improve gender equality in the workplace. While this policy does not directly address the gender wage gap it is a step in ensuring overall gender equality that is likely to promote equal pay.

Looking Ahead

All in all the Icelandic government has shown success in continuously narrowing the gender wage gap through the implementation of these policies. This success allows the nation to stand as a world leader in gender equality. Despite this there is still room for progress especially as Iceland’s demographics change and the country struggles with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistics Iceland reports that immigrants represented 15.2% of the population in Iceland in 2020 — a figure that is consistently growing. Immigrants are at greater risk of poverty in Iceland because they are “less likely to be employed” compared to “their native-born counterparts.” Furthermore the gender wage gap disproportionately impacts immigrant women therefore as the immigrant population in Iceland increases strong gender equality policies remain important.

Another threat to narrowing the gender wage gap in Iceland is the COVID-19 pandemic which has stalled progress in gender equality and poverty eradication worldwide. In Iceland like in all countries where women face a double burden of working while caring for children and the household lockdowns and social distancing force more women to stay home from work. These pandemic effects may threaten to reverse progress in gender wage gap policies. However there is hope that the constant and unyielding work of the Icelandic government will ensure progress for years to come.

When the coronavirus crisis erupted in 2020 it became apparent that the medical emergency was accompanied by severe shortages especially in some medical devices.

The pattern was first observed for ventilators: demand spiked everywhere and the supply chain was disrupted. This was because production of the devices spanned multiple countries with each part dependent on other parts manufactured in different locations. The longer the chain and the more complex the dependence the greater the exposure of any point to the disruption of another one and to mandated shutdowns.

Now two years since Covid first hit this pattern has affected almost every sector of the global economy. “Supply chain issues” have become so widespread that they are now a running joke affecting everything from furniture to groceries. But why has Covid had such a severe effect on how we receive products and goods?

In recent decades supply chains became lean and they lengthened as they became more cost-efficient: more and more steps were added in the manufacture and transportation of any given product in the name of speed and cost. This means there are more and more places where something can go wrong between you ordering something online and it arriving to your door.

Today downstream suppliers – such as those who provide vehicle control systems to your car manufacturer – depend on upstream suppliers – such as chip manufacturers – to deliver on time so they can in turn deliver on time to you.

With long chains risks are now shared between multiple entities all around the world.

Using AI and blockchain to protect trade

Supply chain problems have a knock-on financial effect known as trade credit contagion. This is where firms delay payments to suppliers because their customers delay payments to them. The pay-on-delivery model can lead to cancelled or delayed shipments which can in turn lead to bankruptcies.

While a high proportion of trade credit risk remains uninsured today a post-pandemic world may see insurance and reinsurance firms fill in this protection gap.

Researchers are currently working to develop methodologies to identify vulnerabilities in global supply chains and to understand their trade credit contagion risks. The goal is to make these systems more robust overall.

How can we design ways to design insurance and reinsurance contracts in order to effectively share the risk and mitigate vulnerabilities? How can reliable trade credit lead to fewer delays in supply chains and replace the familiar predicament we face now of paying for something in advance with an unknown delivery date?

Artificial intelligence and complex network theory are helpful in identifying the structures that could pose systemic risk. They help us ask: which patterns of connections are likely to lead to delay and trade credit contagion and which are more robust?

Using these tools we can create large-scale simulators of global supply chains responding to a wide variety of shocks and then use machine learning techniques to detect the problematic parts of the chain. This knowledge can then be used in market designs that strengthen the system before another pandemic or disaster occurs.

Other novel technologies such as blockchain bring the promise of using high-quality data to analyse supply chain dependencies. blockchain technology uses real-time data and transparent verification carried out by multiple parties. In combination with other features such as smart contracts this could lead to a timely resolution in cases of disputes along the supply chain.

My research involves using blockchain to streamline record-keeping and payments. This problem is challenging because the adoption of blockchain depends both on the specifics of the technology and the cost.

The problem of adopting technology in the presence of positive externalities (whereby firms adopting the technology in turn improve the operations of external parties) is an old one in economics but now these externalities are systemic in nature: the effects propagate along the chains. The cost of the technology depends on how many firms adopt it and each one faces business-specific costs based on its position in the supply chain its risk tolerance and its costs to insure these risks.

Real-time recording keeping the traceability of transactions and the immutability of blockchain can all help supply chains become more efficient. This is all the more true if we consider the full length of the chain where transactions need to be verified by several parties: participants in the supply chain insurance and reinsurance firms.

The future of supply chains

Trade credit insurance is likely to grow after the pandemic. It may rely on private-public partnerships – the pandemic has shown that governments become important players when they impose shutdowns in certain areas.

These funds can be used to make up for payment delays reduce losses and jump-start critical production where necessary. But not all links in a chain can be insured and an important challenge is to identify the most important stages under different shock scenarios.

Supply chains can also be rewired – large-scale algorithms can identify which suppliers need to be replaced and which new ones need to emerge.

In a few years supply chains may look different as the overall goal shifts from minimising costs as was the case before the pandemic to minimising delays and trade credit risks. The end consumer will drive the need to rewire the network as demand shifts. Ultimately the flexibility of the customer determines the resilience of the supply chain."

That’s causing some in the industry to worry that it will not only inhibit growth but also affect the quality of work as key positions become harder to fill and lower-level workers jump from company to company in search of a better compensation package .

The industry is hotter than ever with companies routinely raising millions of dollars in venture capital startups blooming on a weekly basis and developers planning more lab space seemingly by the day. But the pipeline of qualified workers to fill all of the added jobs can’t keep up with the burgeoning demand.

It’s almost like Massachusetts has too many biotechs.

Hiring “is definitely more competitive than it was a few years ago there’s just no question about it” said Michael Gilman chief executive of Waltham-based Arrakis Therapeutics which more than doubled its staff during the pandemic.

The surplus of startups reflects investors’ desire to pour more money into the world’s leading biotech hub. But with every new company that comes out of stealth mode or a mega-funding round that comes with mega-hiring goals the people problem has gotten worse.

According to the latest report from industry association MassBio nearly 85000 people work in the state’s life sciences sector up 55 percent from 2008.

Most of the hiring is happening in Cambridge where companies posted more than 2630 biotech job listings on Indeed.com from July through mid-January according to Biotech Networks which tracks employment.

Large companies such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Takeda Pharmaceutical as well as Moderna Therapeutics and its venture capital backer Flagship Pioneering were seeking the most workers during that period.

“You can’t walk two blocks around Kendall Square without receiving a job offer” said Jeanne Gray chief people officer at Relay Therapeutics in Cambridge only half-kiddingly. “I get the sense that a lot of candidates know the market is hot.”

Employee turnover is on the rise too. About 16.5 percent of life sciences employees in Massachusetts voluntarily quit their jobs last year a recent survey from research firm Radford found up from 13 percent in 2018. Both figures are high enough to affect a company’s effort to grow.

Naturally one way to recruit and retain people is to keep paying them more.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the average salary in Massachusetts for chemists and scientists was about $100000 in May 2020. But biotechs are finding that historical data and closely watched benchmark surveys from Radford quickly become outdated.

“One of my companies realized they had fallen behind in some positions by more than 10 percent” said Tony Mullin a biotech human resources executive. “They offered $130000 and were losing candidates because they were getting $145000 or $150000 from other companies.”

Executives said some firms seem to be aggressively outbidding each other for candidates though most agreed it isn’t a sound strategy.

“That’s not a sustainable game to be in upping the ante all the time” said Diego Miralles chief executive of Flagship-backed Laronde which came out of stealth mode last May and raised $440 million three months later. “Candidates definitely get offers that are higher than ours. Some we can’t match.”

There’s also a sense that employees are easily swayed by “title inflation” a phenomenon that occurs when people climb the corporate ladder faster by bouncing around.

”There’s a short-term satisfaction with getting a bigger title” said Daphne Karydas chief financial and operating officer of Flare. “But then along with it comes expectations of doing a certain role.”

Beyond compensation biotech firms are also paying close attention to perks and benefits. It’s not uncommon for companies to have ping-pong tables in their offices or to provide catered lunches Silicon Valley-style.

Dyno Therapeutics’ new office will have a rock climbing wall. Relay recently began offering employees free diapers for the first year of a child’s life. Pet insurance is becoming more common.

These offerings long popular in the tech world are somewhat new in the more conservative biotech industry and many of the firms splurging on them don’t yet generate revenue.

“When I started all they gave you was bad coffee” Miralles said.

Of course there’s more money to go around now.

Gilman said the first biotech he founded raised $4 million in its first round of funding more than 15 years ago; today companies can raise $400 million at the same stage.

Cambridge-based Generate Biomedicines which just raised $370 million plans to hire 420 people over the next two years. The company founded in 2018 by Flagship Pioneering is willing to pay the price for top candidates and reaches out to some before they’ve graduated.

But with such an ambitious hiring goal Gevorg Grigoryan Generate’s chief technology officer admitted “It’s kind of not entirely clear how we do that.”

“We’ve internally said keeping the bar high is the primary goal” he said referring to the quality of hires. “We will be hoping to reach our numbers but the numbers will never come first.”

Several companies said the pandemic combined with the desire to grow quickly prompted them for the first time to hire workers who don’t live in Massachusetts and have no plans to move to the state. It’s becoming a popular option for recruiting hard-to-find computational scientists or even some executives who don’t need to do experiments in a lab. But because of the pandemic even local lab-based employees are being given more freedom to do their reading or analysis at home a few days a week.

Grigoryan said expanding the talent pool beyond Massachusetts is an “easy way to kind of simplify the problem for yourself” in a tight labor market. But he warned that hiring too many remote employees to fill job openings could be a quick fix that forever changes what it means to work in the biotech epicenter of the world.

When it comes to culture and career development Grigoryan said “Oftentimes we found that being local is really important both for the company and the employee.”

Brendan Frey chief executive of Canada-based Deep Genomicssaid that in Toronto the artificial intelligence drug discovery firm had the “luxury of being the main act in town.” But after setting up an outpost in Boston with fewer than a dozen employees over the summer Frey said attrition is already an issue.

“People know in their gut that all of this kind of hyperactivity is perhaps not best for them or for the companies” he said. “Forgetting about whether they should join Deep Genomics or not I’m thinking ‘You’re going to run into trouble later on.’ ”

Adam Koppel managing director of Bain Capital Life Sciences said he often gets asked about what could slow the momentum of the Cambridge-Boston biotech ecosystem.

“The proliferation of new companies has created somewhat of a supply and demand mismatch in the marketplace for skilled managers” he said.

Koppel said the talent pool has not matured enough to fill key areas from the C-suite and clinical development all the way through to the commercial launch of products. And he said there is increasingly competitive intensity in the industry due to many “copycats” that are “going after the same targets.”

“The ecosystem could benefit from a certain degree of consolidation” he added.

At least for now though executives seem to believe that the biotechnology business in Massachusetts will keep expanding regardless of its hiring and retention problems.

“It is conceivable that all the capital dries up in our industry companies shut down lay off scientists and they have no place to go” Gilman said. “I don’t see that happening anytime soon honestly.”

The COVID pandemic has radically changed the ordinary functioning of life across the globe. One of the largest changes has been to education. In the US schools were closed or moved to Zoom and those that returned to in-person learning often did so with masks distancing and plexiglass shields. There have been many consequences of this change but one of the most significant is that it brought the day-to-day practices of schools out into the open.

For the first time Zoom gave parents a window into public school classrooms and many of them didn’t like what they saw. From poor lessons to inappropriate reading material to troubling racial essentialism parents were roused from their usual passivity to push back against the educational monoculture that dominates school boards unions and academic schools of education. This pushback has taken various forms from ill-advised and authoritarian anti-CRT laws to reasonable transparency laws and from Twitter campaigns to parent protests at school boards. Parents want schools open and they want to know what their kids are being taught.

A key moment in this parental awakening came in early October when Democrat Terry McAuliffe insisted that he didn’t “think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” This was widely seen as a major turning point during the 2021 race for governor in the very blue state of Virginia. McAuliffe had been leading in the polls but K–12 parents in particular abandoned him en masse and he ultimately lost to Republican newcomer Glenn Youngkin.

This electoral upset exposed—at a national level—the massive gap that had grown between parents on the one hand and pundits politicians and teachers’ unions on the other. Parents do want a say in what their children are taught. But not everyone agrees. In December a New York Times writer stated on Meet the Press “I don't really understand this idea that parents should decide what's being taught. I'm not a professional educator. I don't have a degree in social studies.”

Well I am a professional educator. I am a professor of education who teaches teachers and I can say unequivocally that the belief that one needs to be a professional educator to have meaningful insights as to what ought to be taught reflects a fundamental philosophical and cultural misunderstanding of what education actually is.

People who work in the media or in politics tend to assume that their experiences are unquestionably normative. They are almost exclusively college-educated city-dwellers who were good at navigating a system of schooling that is as much networking and conformity as it is algebra and biology. For them education is and was a predominantly social and cultural reality the substance of which happens to be made up of academic content. Successfully achieving careers in high-prestige fields they excelled at what education researchers have termed the “hidden curriculum”—the underlying norms and values that form the backbone of socialization into particular worldviews and practices. And because they (perhaps subconsciously) equate the business of education with this socialization they tend to see the social values of education as the legitimate enterprise of education professionals not parents.

But there’s something deeply mistaken about this view. “Education”—a noun standing on its own—doesn’t exist. There is no set of concepts ideas facts or skills that are intrinsically necessary for individual human beings to possess. The breakdown of school subjects into math science English language arts and social studies is an accident of history. A few different twists and turns and the very categories wouldn’t even exist—math might have been part of science English may have been part of history and Latin might still be considered a critical subject. The particular content of these categories might have been different as well. For example the Singaporean approach to math is very different from the American approach. In Singapore whole-part relations are used to understand both adding and subtracting instead of treating the two as discrete domains; students there are learning “math” but it’s not exactly the same math as most American students are learning.

The problem with the idea of “education” runs deeper however. When we talk about education we’re really talking about “education for…” Education researchers can think deeply and run trials about the best techniques for teaching particular math concepts and they can study which math concepts are most important to know for someone who wants to be an engineer. But nobody can study whether or not it’s good to be an engineer. We still would have to ask: good for what? For making money? For building bridges? For impressing friends and family?

In fact the pundits are right—education is about values but no educator or education researcher can tell us which values are worthwhile. Indeed the most significant instance in which educators did impose their values with the force of law resulted in one of the most horrific cultural genocides in US history as Native Americans were forcibly stripped of their language and culture in “Indian schools” designed to Westernize them.

Of course there are some things that we need from our education system in order to function as a society. We need an education system that will encourage students to grow into law-abiding citizens; we need a system that allows people to flourish and to live happy lives; and we need education that will encourage people to engage in honest work and support their families productively. But which work is important rewarding or fulfilling is impossible for education research to determine. The claim that education should promote these public goods is not an educational argument itself. It’s a statement of values driven by the specific nature of the United States as an open liberal generally capitalist democratic society.

Perhaps the greatest strength of American culture is that we respect and value differences. As a nation of immigrants we have managed to absorb people from around the world who bring with them all sorts of ideas about what constitutes a good life. Each of these groups has contributed to the American experience by providing a novel model of life for the rest of us to learn from. Similarly newcomers have incorporated the values of the rest of American society into their own lives.

The choices that local communities make about how they want to live their lives and what they consider valuable are not the sorts of things that can be determined by research. Their ideals do however dictate the sort of education that ought to be provided to students to support those values. Thus by its very nature to be successful education in the United States must be organized bottom-up—we can’t organize education until we know the model of life we are educating for and Americans of all stripes are going to have very different ideas about what that life ought to look like. There’s a reason why America has never had a completely centralized educational system as do the Europeans.

Pundits and politicians who don’t think parents should have a say in what children are taught are actually attempting to prescribe in a homogenized top-down way a model of life that worked for them as they skillfully and successfully navigated the hidden curriculum of their own environments. But this success and in particular the explicit curriculum that accompanied it is not intrinsically better or more valuable than any other and indeed we know that it has failed countless students across the country. Their appeal to the authority of education researchers is simply a mechanism to entrench a system that validates their life choices and values but those with other values interests and intellectual inclinations will be ill-served by the very same system.

This is not specifically an anti-CRT argument. CRT happens to represent the present values of a small segment of mostly upper-class urban elites but any set of values when uniformly imposed top-down will harm children and communities who see the world very differently. The trick these policymakers play is to pretend that their conception of education is not just one choice among many but is the default baseline from which anything else is a deviation.

The model of life they imagine is based on the myth of an all-purpose education designed by experts to allow every child to choose any future they like. But this has produced an educational system that has left many students with no future; it’s been a failure for all but a select few precisely because it doesn’t prepare students for all possibilities (an impossibility) but actually reflects the concerns and interests of a small minority of education experts. The idea that those experts and only those experts can opine on what to teach and how to teach it is self-serving. Parents sense this and respond accordingly.

It’s not clear whether this new parental awareness will translate into any sort of meaningful reform of the public school system. The system hasn’t changed all that much and public education is still roiled by the disruptions of COVID. We will have to see what education looks like on the other side of this pandemic before we can assess whether or not parents’ efforts have yielded fruit. But regardless of the degree of systemic change one thing is clear: parents are now paying attention and quite reasonably they have strong views on what they want their children to learn.

As one of the “professional educators” who supposedly has legitimate insight into the appropriate workings of education I couldn’t be happier to see parents take the reins. Education is an expression of culture and values not just a series of facts and values belong to parents and their communities. As a researcher I can answer education questions on all sorts of topics from curriculum design to memory and retention but please don’t ask me what to teach."

Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer David Solomon's total compensation for 2021 will be $35 million the bank said on Friday.

That is double the $17.5 million he received for 2020. The board had then slashed $10 million from his $27.5 million pay to settle legal costs related to the bank's role in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd corruption scandal.

Solomon's total pay for 2021 includes an annual base salary of $2 million and a variable compensation of $33 million 70% of which is in the form of goal-based stock compensation or restricted stock units.

Morgan Stanley raised CEO James Gorman's annual pay to $35 million while JPMorgan lifted Jamie Dimon's to $34.5 million.

Since taking over the reins from Lloyd Blankfein in 2018 Solomon 60 has looked to diversify revenue focusing more on predictable streams including consumer banking and wealth and asset management while reducing reliance on capital markets-focused businesses.

What’s the answer?’

BOCA RATON Fla. — The stock market had been open for only 17 minutes when Leon Cooperman picked up the phone to check how much money he’d made. He dialed a private line to his trading desk in New Jersey just as he did a dozen times each day. “Decent start to the morning?” he asked.

“Oh yeah. The market’s shaky but you’re up.”

“Give me numbers.”

“Looks like six seven million.”

“Fine. Thank you. Let’s keep holding steady” said Cooperman 78. He hung up and watched a stock graph on his computer screen as it rose from one minute to the next charting another good day to be a billionaire in America. Outside the office he could see his wife leaving to play in her weekly bridge game and a group of golfers strolling past on a private course. He’d chosen to live in Florida for at least 183 days each year in part to benefit from the state’s low tax rate for residents and from 7 a.m. until midnight he was typically seated at the desk in his office managing the more than $2.5 billion he’d made during a career as an investor and a hedge fund manager.

He’d been earning more than his family could spend since about 1975 and in the decades since then he’d come to see the act of making money less as a personal necessity than as a serious game he could play and win. He invested it traded it lent it gave it away and watched each day as the accounts continued to grow beyond his needs his wants and sometimes even his own comprehension.

“I don’t want to say it’s all play money at this point but what else could I possibly spend it on?” he sometimes wondered. His wife’s walk-in closet was already bigger than the South Bronx apartment where he’d grown up. Their Florida home had a custom-built infinity pool and in five years he’d never once gone in for a swim.

He checked the stock graph on his screen and called his trading desk again.

“Still good? Any news?”

“Very good yeah. The highfliers are getting killed but the value stocks are doing great. You’re up about 10 million.”

The past year had been the best time in history to be one of America’s 745 billionaires whose cumulative wealth has grown by an estimated 70 percent since the beginning of the pandemic even as tens of millions of low-wage workers have lost their jobs or their homes. Together those 745 billionaires are now worth more than the bottom 60 percent of American households combined and each day Cooperman could see that gap widening on his balance sheet — up an average of $4788 per minute in the stock market $1.9 million per day and $700 million total in 2021. As a record amount of wealth continued to shift toward a tiny fraction of people at the pinnacle of the economy Cooperman could sense something else shifting too.

“Billionaires shouldn’t even exist in America” read one note he’d received after he went on TV to recommend stock picks.

“One day we’re coming after all of you with pitchforks” read another message.

“Wake up moron. YOU and your insatiable greed are at the root of our biggest societal problems.”

He responded to most of the personal emails kept record of the occasional death threats and wrote letters to politicians such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) whenever they criticized billionaires in their speeches because he couldn’t understand: What exactly had he done wrong? What rule had he broken? He’d been born to poor immigrant parents on the losing end of a capitalist economy. He’d attended public schools taken on debt to become the first in his family to attend college worked 80-hour weeks made smart decisions benefited from some good luck amassed a fortune for himself and for his clients and paid hundreds of millions in taxes to the government. He had a wife of 57 years two successful children and three grandchildren who were helping him decide how to give most of his money away to a long list of charities. “My life is the story of the American Dream” he’d said while accepting an award at one charity gala and he’d always imagined himself as the rags-to-riches hero only to now find himself cast as the greedy villain in a story of economic inequality run amok.

And now came another series of emails from a stranger who ran a charity in New Jersey. She said billionaires were avoiding paying their fair share of taxes by using loopholes in the tax code. She said their legacy of excessive wealth was “burdening future generations.” She said Cooperman had no idea what it was like to live in poverty or to choose each month between paying rent or buying food.

“She makes decent points” Cooperman said as he read the email again and it made him think back to a question he’d begun wondering about himself: In a time of historic inequality what were the moral responsibilities of a billionaire?

“Thank you for your emails. It might be helpful for me to provide you with some background about myself” he wrote back and then he attached a short biography and copies of his letters to politicians. “There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of who I am.”

***

He knew what people imagined when they thought of a billionaire. He’d read the stories of excess and extravagance and witnessed some of it firsthand but that wasn’t him. He didn’t spend $238 million on a New York penthouse like hedge fund manager Ken Griffin; or vacation at his own private island in Belize like Bill Gates; or throw himself $10 million birthday parties featuring camels and acrobats like investor Stephen Schwarzman; or drop $70000 a year on hair care like Donald Trump; or buy a preserved 14-foot shark for an estimated $8 million like Steven Cohen; or spend more than $1 billion on art like media mogul David Geffen; or budget $23 million for personal security like Facebook did for Mark Zuckerberg.

He didn’t have his own spaceships like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos; or a 600-foot flying airship like Sergey Brin; or a decommissioned Soviet fighter jet like Larry Ellison; or a $215 million yacht with a helipad and a pool like Steve Wynn; or a private train with three staterooms like John Paul DeJoria; or a $5 million luxury car collection like Kylie Jenner.

What Cooperman had for transportation was a 25-year-old Schwinn bicycle he liked to ride around the neighborhood and a Hyundai he used for running errands a few times each week.

He rechecked the stock graph on his screen and picked up his phone to call his wife Toby who was sitting in her office suite down the hall.

“I’m going to head out and grab some of those Costco lamb chops later” he told her.

“We need anything else?” she asked.

“I don't think so” he said. “I’ll just see what’s on special.”

They’d been together since they met at Hunter College in 1962 when tuition at the public New York university cost as little as $24 per semester and the promise of a life in America was that each generation would surpass the one before. She was the daughter of a struggling pillowcase salesman from Romania; he was the son of a plumber’s apprentice who emigrated from Poland at age 13 never finished high school worked six days a week and later died of a heart attack while carrying a sink up the stairs to a fourth-story apartment.

His father left behind an estate worth less than $100000 but Cooperman also inherited his father’s belief that the economic ladder between poor and rich was short enough to climb with determination and hard work. More than 90 percent of children born in the United States during the 1940s would go on to out-earn their parents; two-thirds of those born into poverty would rise into at least the middle class. Cooperman waited tables during the summers worked for Xerox while he went to business school at night and then started as an analyst at Goldman Sachs making $12500 a year. “My PhD is for poor hungry and driven” he liked to say. He told colleagues that capitalism was like a battle for survival in the African safari and that the key to success was to adopt the mind-set of a lion or a gazelle during a hunt. “When the sun comes up you’d better be running” Cooperman told them. Within nine years he’d been named a partner. Within a decade he was a millionaire.

Together he and Toby had learned how to be rich which mostly meant deciding how not to spend their money. He still felt most comfortable shopping for clothes wholesale and commuting to work on New Jersey public transit. Toby enjoyed her job as a special-education teacher even if she didn’t need the $25 an hour so she continued working and donated her salary back to the school. They bought a house for $325000 in New Jersey in the 1980s and later built their $5 million home in Florida. They worried about demotivating their two children by giving them a massive inheritance so instead they put a small fraction of their wealth into a trust that could be accessed only once their sons turned 35 at which point one was already a successful businessman and the other was an environmental scientist with a PhD.

Cooperman eventually left Goldman Sachs to start his own hedge fund Omega and for two decades he compounded his millions at an average of 14 percent each year as the stock market soared until he and Toby were among the wealthiest few hundred billionaires in the United States. They were invited to dinner in 2010 by Gates and Warren Buffett who had just started a program called the Giving Pledge asking billionaires to donate at least half of their money to charity and the Coopermans committed that night.

“I could buy a Picasso for a hundred million but it doesn’t turn me on so then what?” Cooperman told them. “We live a very rational lifestyle. What better use is there for our money?”

They’d given away $150 million to a hospital in New Jersey $50 million for college scholarships to Newark high school students $40 million to Columbia Business School $40 million to Hunter College $30 million to performing arts $25 million to the Jewish Family Fund $20 million to skilled nursing $15 million to food banks and on and on it went. But no matter how much they gave away their money continued to make more money even as wages for the middle class remained essentially flat. In the past 50 years the gap between poor families and the top 0.1 percent had increased more than tenfold. Children now had only a 43 percent chance of out-earning their parents.

“Mr. Cooperman your donation is needed to keep the American Dream off life support” read one of the dozens of solicitations he received each day.

“Mr. Cooperman more than 11 million American children are now living in poverty …”

“Mr. Cooperman please help us provide clean drinking water …”

“Mr. Cooperman the pandemic has left 60 million families at risk of losing their homes …”

He donated to more than 50 organizations each year and also to a number of people who wrote to him in personal distress. “Other than my family writing checks is the most meaningful thing I do” Cooperman said and yet no matter how many zeros he included it left him wanting to do more. “We’re going in the wrong direction in this country in so many depressing ways” he said. He believed in the meritocratic ideal of capitalism — “equal opportunity if not equal results” he said — but it seemed to him that the odds of success remained stacked by race by gender and increasingly by economic starting position. Rates of intergenerational poverty had gone up in each of the past three decades. The most disadvantaged children were falling further behind. He believed from his own experience that a college education was the best answer and yet tuition costs were continuing to skyrocket.

“It’s not exactly a fair system until you even up the odds” he said and after looking over the list of worthy causes he and Toby had decided that donating half of their money didn’t feel sufficient. Sixty percent wasn’t enough to meet the country’s needs. Neither was 75. So they’d agreed to set up a family foundation that would eventually give away more than 90 percent of their money and Cooperman had decided that rather than retiring in earnest he would continue to manage their account so there would be more to give away.

“He who dies rich dies disgraced” read a quotation attributed to Andrew Carnegie on Cooperman’s office desk but on this day he was still rich and getting richer. “What’s enough?” he wondered. “What’s the answer?” He checked the stock graph on his screen — up $2.6 million in the past five hours. His accounts were equal to the average net worth of 23000 middle-class American families.

Each day when the stock market closed at 4 p.m. he checked the final numbers on his 40 stock holdings reviewed his investment strategy for the next day and then left for a two-mile walk around the palm trees and putting greens of St. Andrews Country Club in Boca Raton. The community was set off from the surrounding suburbs by a canal a gatehouse a 10-foot wall and an infrared security system. A few of the 700 homes were owned by other billionaires and most others belonged to millionaires who wintered in Florida. All of the residents had gotten richer during the pandemic as the luxury real estate market exploded and their home values surged by more than 40 percent.

Cooperman walked past an old designer home that was being torn down and rebuilt into a new designer home. He continued up the road toward the clay tennis courts the spa and the terraced clubhouse. A resident drove by in a new Bentley and Cooperman waved and then watched the $200000 car drive on. “You get a lot of people who show off their wealth” he said “but I could buy and sell that guy 100 times.”

He and Toby had spent almost all of their time during the pandemic within the gates of St. Andrews eating dinner outside at the clubhouse and playing cards with friends but every few days they liked to go for a drive. Once early in the pandemic they’d driven to a quiet nearby park only to find more than 150 cars lined up in the parking lot as people waited for bags of canned goods at an impromptu food bank. “Depressing and staggering in a country of such wealth” Cooperman said and it made him remember a poem his granddaughter had written and published when she was in middle school called “Seven Miles” about the physical proximity between the extreme wealth of Short Hills N.J. where Cooperman had his other home and the extreme poverty in nearby Newark. “At one end we have too much” she’d written. “At the other they have nothing. Spread it all just seven miles.”

She’d gone on to graduate Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford becoming an “ultraliberal socialist type in favor of wealth redistribution” Cooperman said. He adored her and admired both her empathy and her intellect but he’d repeatedly fought against the liberal idea that one way to redistribute that wealth was to tax billionaires at a rate of 70 percent or more. He’d written to Sen. Warren about her “soak-the-rich positions” and to President Barack Obama about “villainizing success.” He was a registered independent and he’d voted for Joe Biden in the last election because he considered President Donald Trump a “would-be dictator whose comportment in office was beyond disgraceful” but Cooperman believed most of all in the basic tenets of capitalism. He’d earned his money and therefore it was his to spend or give away. He sent in a quarterly check for $10 million to the federal government in estimated taxes and said he paid an effective tax rate of 34 percent. He’d told politicians in his letters that he was willing to pay more but he believed the highest effective tax rate should be no more than 50 percent.

“What made America great is our system of capitalism incentivizing work and effort and ingenuity” he’d written. “Capitalism has flaws but socialism has no benefits. Why not spread my work ethic instead of just my wealth?”

Now he looped around a cul-de-sac and turned back toward his house. For years he’d been doing these daily walks with his brother Howard until he died in December at age 85 and lately Cooperman had been thinking back over their lives. Cooperman had chosen to wake up at 5:15 each morning and devote 80 hours every week to his work taking off only the Friday after Thanksgiving. His brother meanwhile had chosen not to go to college and then retired as soon as he could. He preferred to play racquetball go to the casino with friends and volunteer as a wheelchair transporter at the hospital. Cooperman had ended up with his billions and his name on top of the hospital entrance; his brother had died with relatively modest amounts of money but with a cellphone loaded with numbers for dozens of close friends.

“We both got what we worked for” Cooperman said. “We were best friends and we admired what each other had but it would have been wrong to take what I earned and given it all over to him.”

He walked up his circular driveway into the house and back toward his office.

“Different choices different outcomes” he said. “The world isn’t meant to be totally even.”

***

His choice: 12 more hours anchored to the chair in his office monitoring the market and calling in to his trading desk again and again as the sun reflected off the swimming pool outside his window. The market fell. The market rose. He bought $3 million in distressed bonds. He gave another $5 million away to charity. He was $18 million up for the day. He was $6 million down. He was beating the market again by mid-morning losing at lunch winning an hour later and then losing again. “Does it make any sense?” he asked himself watching the numbers change on his screen. “To sit inside all day in front of a machine making money I don’t need so I can give it to someone I don’t know?”

He’d been wondering since his brother’s death whether there were better ways to spend some of his time so one afternoon before the stock market closed he shut off his computer and drove a few miles outside the gates of St. Andrews to visit Florida Atlantic University. The school’s president had invited Cooperman to speak to a group of low-income college students about his career and his values.

“Believe it or not I have a great deal of commonality with all of you” Cooperman said as he stood at the lectern and looked out at the crowd of about 40 students from a university scholarship program much like the one Cooperman and his wife had started in New Jersey. Most were students of color who had been born to immigrant parents. All of them came from families with incomes of $30000 or less. The students had been living on campus during the pandemic as some of their families were upended by layoffs by evictions by a Haitian earthquake by a Dominican drought by coronavirus infections and covid-19 deaths.

“I can understand some of the challenges you’re facing right now” Cooperman said starting a short PowerPoint presentation about his journey from a one-bedroom apartment to the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans.

“I worked very hard. I wanted to win” he told them as he flipped to the next slide.

“I’m a great believer in capitalism” he said. “We have the best economic system in the world.”

“How do you become wealthy?” he asked. “You develop a product or a service that people want. The world is better off for a Larry Ellison a Bill Gates. Look at the jobs they created. Look at the good they did for the world. The attack on wealthy people makes no sense to me.”

“I’m giving the money away” he said. “It’s been my pledge and my wife’s pledge to give it all away.”

He finished going through the slides and then asked for questions and after a while a student in the center of the room raised her hand and waited for the microphone. She said she was also interested in a career in business and she explained that one of the many barriers in her way was the start-up cost. “In Florida you need $200” she said.

“You’re going to need a lot more than that” Cooperman said.

“I know” she said. “I just mean two hundred to get the license the paperwork from zero.”

Cooperman looked at her for a moment and tried to imagine what it would mean to start again from zero and what it would be like to ascend from poverty to extreme wealth not in the 1960s but in 2022 when that gap had multiplied 10 times. But he’d occupied these students’ place in the American economy once. His faith in the American Dream required him to believe that they could one day occupy his.

“I’ll admit it’s very hard” he said. “It’s gotten harder. But the 99 percent can still join the 1 percent. It’s possible with enough luck and commitment.”

He told them about how he’d gotten up each morning at 5:15; how he’d chosen a job that he loved; how he’d gotten his PhD in being poor hungry and driven; how he’d followed his instincts; how he’d attacked each day like a lion chasing a gazelle as he raced to the pinnacle of the economy and the 99 percent receded behind him.

Solomon 59 received a $35 million pay package for 2021 up from the $17.5 million he earned in 2020 after the Wall Street firm posted significant profits last year.

In 2021 the bank reported a net income of $21.64 billion compared with $9.46 billion a year earlier and reported a 23% increase in fourth-quarter operating expenses mainly due to higher compensation and benefits costs Reuters reported.

In 2021 Goldman Sachs reported a net income of $21.64 billion compared with $9.46 billion a year earlier

Solomon's total pay for 2021 includes an annual base salary of $2 million and a variable compensation of $33 million 70% of which is in the form of goal-based stock compensation or restricted stock units.

He is not the only Wall Street CEO who saw a pay raise last year Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman also raked in $35 million and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon earned $34.5 million in 2021.

Solomon's raise comes after his salary was slashed by $10 million in 2020 after earning $27.5 million the year before.

Solomon's pay along with that of Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron were reduced because of the company’s involvement in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal.

Goldman Sachs raised $6.5 billion in three bond sales for the 1Malaysia Development Berhad state fund between 2012 and 2013. Malaysian and U.S. authorities found in 2015 that $4.5 billion from the fund was siphoned by its leaders and used for a variety of personal luxury expenses. Goldman Sachs reached a $2.9 billion settlement for its involvement in raising the money.

DAVID SOLOMON: THE GOLDMAN SACHS CEO WITH A DJING SIDE HUSTLE As well as working as a top Goldman Sachs executive Solomon spends his nights DJing super clubs all over the world David Solomon 59 has served as CEO of Goldman Sachs since October 2018. The New Yorker has also been chairman of the bank since January 2019. Prior to this he was president and chief operating officer from January 2017 to September 2018. And worked as the joint head of the investment banking division from July 2006 to December 2016. As well as working as a top Goldman Sachs executive Solomon spends his nights DJing super clubs all over the world. The divorced 59-year-old performs under the name DJ D-Sol and has even performed at the MTV Europe Music Awards in London His side hustle was outed by the New York Times in 2017 amid his campaign to be named Goldman CEO. Solomon has said he also likes to ride the subway to work fetch his own coffee in the office and relaxed the firm’s dress code making suits and ties optional. In 2020 Solomon's annual pay fell by $10million or 36 percent. It came after the firm clawed back executive pay after it agreed to pay nearly $3billion in fines to the Department of Justice for its role in a Malaysian bribery scandal. His personal life has been just as tumultuous. According to CNBC his divorce was finalized in 2018. And in his second week as CEO Solomon’s former assistant killed himself after being charged with stealing $1.2 million worth of wine from Solomon’s collection.

As of 2022 Goldman’s shares are down more than 12 percent which is worse than the market as a whole which is down about 7.6 percent the Post reported.

Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 as a partner and climbed the corporate ladder until becoming its CEO in October 2018 and chairman in January 2019.

Since taking over from Lloyd Blankfein in 2018 Solomon has looked to diversify the bank's revenue with more focus on consumer banking mass-market wealth management and cash management.

In February 2021 Solomon slammed working from home as an 'aberration' and said it is not the 'new normal' as he revealed the company is not likely to be offering it as a permanent option.

Solomon said he was particularly worried about the incoming class of 3000 new recruits who he fears won't get the 'direct mentorship' and 'direct contact' that they need.

He added that he is a 'big believer in personal connectivity' and so foresees that Goldman's pre-pandemic operating style will return.

'I am very focused on the fact that I don't want another class of young people arriving at Goldman Sachs in the summer remotely' he told the conference.

'I don't think as we get out of the pandemic the overall operating mode of the way a business like ours operates will be vastly different.

The firm had allowed a 'significant portion' of employees to shift to working remotely during the pandemic.

The CEO revealed that Goldman Sachs operated throughout 2020 with 'less than 10% of our people' on average working from offices throughout the firm's various global bases.

Goldman Sachs drew public criticism and backlash throughout 2021.

In January a former intern named Emily shared a YouTube video describing her experience interning there in 2016 as being the ‘internship from hell.’ She called it a ‘traumatic’ and ‘cutthroat’ program that included working from 5:40 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. without having her own desk.

Then in March a group of junior bankers made a PowerPoint presentation complaining of conditions like working 100 hours a week. A number of the 13 analysts who made the presentation said that they would quit by the summer if conditions didn’t improve. One claimed that his experience at Goldman was 'arguably worse' than his childhood in foster care. The PowerPoint leaked to the media and days later Solomon vowed to employees that he would work harder to give them Saturdays off.

Employees said that it only rubs salt in the wound to see Solomon riding the heels of his EDM career and playing opulent gigs in the Hamptons while they struggle to get a full day off work.

Politically speaking we now have Red-Handed by Peter Schweizer who would very much like to help us digest the business past of the 46th president’s troublesome son.

Schweizer’s works include Clinton Cash a compendium of opposition research that helped shape the presidential election in 2016. These days he is president of the Government Accountability Institute a think tank funded by the Mercer family part of the rightwing ecosystem.

Rebekah Mercer chairs the GAI board a position previously held by Steve Bannon whom Donald Trump pardoned of fraud charges but who is now under indictment for contempt of Congress. Mercer is also a founding investor in Parler a rightwing alternative to Twitter and communications vehicle for Trump’s faithful in the run-up to the 6 January insurrection.

The Mercers are mainstays of Breitbart News and once funded James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas – of which more later. Via Cambridge Analytica the Mercers helped hijack Brexit. Not surprisingly Nigel Farage counts the Mercers as allies.

If Republicans recapture the House in November as expected most see investigations of Hunter Biden and his father an inevitable sequel. Schweizer has published a roadmap from sources including Secret Service travel logs materials from former business associates and that infamous laptop.

Schweizer argues that the rich and powerful have grown too cozy with China at the expense of their own country. His central contention is that the Biden family garnered approximately $31m from individuals with direct ties to Chinese intelligence.

Hunter Biden has denied wrongdoing. In 2020 Politifact said Schweizer’s claims about Joe Biden did “not add up to a picture” of his “being corrupt or pursuing policies contrary to the national interest”.

Schweizer however fires shots across the political spectrum. John Boehner a Republican speaker of the House and Henry Kissinger secretary of state to two Republican presidents are in his sights. So are the Bushes. Chuck Schumer Mark Warner Chris Coons and Joe Manchin all Democratic senators are praised.

Schweizer lambasts Silicon Valley for enabling China’s rise and turning a blind eye to human rights abuses. Elon Musk and Bill Gates are criticized Wall Street (prominently Goldman Sachs Blackstone and Black Rock) the National Basketball Association and academe too. Yale University receives particular attention.

Not surprisingly Schweizer does not consider links to China enjoyed by Trump and his most ardent followers. He ignores for example tax records that show Trump International Hotels Management paid more than $188000 in China while pursuing licensing deals between 2013 and 2015 and maintained a bank account there.

Likewise Schweizer looks away from Ted Cruz. The Texas senator’s wife is a banker at Goldman. The Cruzes hold direct investments of between $15000 and $50000 in the Goldman Sachs China Equity Fund Class P a mutual fund with positions in Alibaba and Tencent – companies firmly in Schweizer’s sights.

Then again the Mercers are Cruz donors. In 2016 Cruz’s presidential campaign was a Cambridge Analytica client.

Schweizer calls for a US lobbying ban on companies linked to the Chinese military and Chinese intelligence and their exclusion from US stock exchanges. He also demands the press pursue big tech involvement with China.

As models for how to resist the Chinese he holds out Peter Thiel and his company Palantir. Thiel a rightwing megadonor gained notoriety when he wrote in 2009 that women and minorities had mucked up democratic capitalism. A Palantir employee planted the concept of data harvesting with Cambridge Analytica.

As for China’s territorial ambitions? In another book Trump was quoted by the Washington Post’s Josh Rogin. If the Chinese were to invade Taiwan he told a senator “there isn’t a fucking thing we can do”.

It seems unlikely the US could be capable of decoupling its economy from China while avoiding clashes. China’s opacity with regard to Covid does not instill confidence. Schweizer’s book does at least deliver food for thought.

‘Free speech for me …’

If Red-Handed is an amalgam of more than 1100 footnotes facts arguments and innuendos American Muckraker by James O’Keefe the founder of Project Veritas is a 288-page exercise in self-reverence.

“The American Muckraker understands that the path to truth involves suffering and sacrifice” O’Keefe writes. OK. Elsewhere he compares his plight to that of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Alabama in the late 1950s as it worked for “equality”. Really. He also repeatedly refers to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn the great Russian dissident.

What does O’Keefe do for a living? Mostly he makes sting videos targeting Democrats and progressives. Targets have included Planned Parenthood and a teachers’ union.

Practically speaking American Muckraker is O’Keefe’s attempt to bolster his claim of being a journalist while re-defining what the media actually is in an era of cold civil war. On that note he recounts a conversation with Brian Karem after the Playboy White House reporter had a dust-up with a Trump loyalist Sebastian Gorka.

“I’m on the same team as you” said O’Keefe. “I respect you guys.”

Really? Project Veritas counts the Donald J Trump Foundation among past donors and Erik Prince former head of the Blackwater private security company and brother of Trump’s education secretary Betsy DeVos was involved in its sting operations against Trump adversaries. O’Keefe makes clear he is not keen on a shedding a light on those who fund his work.

He does have a genuine grievance. In early November 2021 the FBI raided his apartment handcuffed him in his underwear and seized two phones. He was not arrested.

Reportedly the feds swooped in connection with the disappearance and unauthorized publication of a diary kept by Ashley Biden the president’s daughter. Project Veritas never wrote anything on the topic and handed the document over. The justice department had placed the first amendment and O’Keefe’s civil liberties in its crosshairs notwithstanding a court-ordered warrant.

But that is only part of the story. In 2020 O’Keefe sued the New York Times for libel in connection with its coverage of videos concerning alleged voter fraud in Minnesota. A New York judge refused to dismiss the suit and O’Keefe has obtained an injunction that bars the paper from publishing documents written by a Project Veritas lawyer.

O’Keefe’s mantra might be: “Free speech for me – but not for thee.”

Despite the efforts of Richard Nixon in the case of the Pentagon Papers prior restraint remains anathema to a free press – as Donald Trump’s late brother Robert learned when he failed to block publication of a niece’s tell-all.

Nonetheless Trump allies are urging the supreme court to reconsider protections afforded to the media under US libel law. Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have indicated they are willing. The fact that the decision in question was rendered by a unanimous court a half-century ago means little. American Muckraker is a book for such troubled times."

My review model F Sport included the Black Line Special Edition with special black-out exterior trim and wheels black rear spoiler and two custom pieces of Zero Halliburton luggage.

Powered by a 3.5-liter six-cylinder engine the ES 350 F Sport delivers 302 horses. The engine is paired with an eight-speed automatic trany. The car also has select drive modes: Eco Normal and Sport for greater driving pleasure. Expect to get 22/city 31/highway and 25/combined mpg.

Available in four trims: base Luxury F Sport and Ultra Luxury. The F Sport is also available with a Black Line Special Edition. The review will focus on the F Sport with the Black Line Special Edition.

Special equipment on the F Sport included: sport-tuned suspension blind-spot monitoring 19-inch wheels pedestrian detection automatic wipers heated and ventilated front seats drive-seat memory settings and power tilt-telescoping steering wheel.

The Black Line Special Edition added special black-out exterior trim and wheel black rear spoiler and two pieces of Zero Halliburton luggage.

On the inside the Lexus ES350 is plush and lush. I found the seats to be plush yet supportive and I had plenty of room to stretch my legs when I engaged the adaptive cruise control which I have to add was one of my favorite things about the ES350. I find holding a speed and distance to be quite stress-inducing. It was wonderful to leave all that to the car.

Backseat passengers are not overlooked in the ES350 there’s plenty of room for two adults to sit comfortably. Cargo space is good too with 16.7 cubic feet of space. The backseats do not fold down however so longer items could be a problem.

Acceleration from a stop is great making hopping onto the freeway easy (except if there is traffic) and the car kicks into cruising speed smoothly and crisply. The ES350 corners great and has a tight turn radius. It’s a smooth driving car with a quiet cabin and nice sound system.

When looking for a luxury car with a lot of sport add the 2021 Lexus ES 350 F Sport to your list.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Police recovered about 100 bags of fentanyl from the bedroom of a 13-year-old who died after a presumed fentanyl exposure at his school in Hartford Connecticut.

Forty bags of fentanyl were also removed from the teen’s school according to police. Both sets of bags were packaged the same way and marked with a similar stamp according to a press release by the Hartford Police Department.

The young teenager died on January 15 two days after he was found unconscious after a presumed fentanyl exposure at the Sport and Medical Sciences Academy.

Two other male students also seventh graders who came into contact with the fentanyl at the same time were taken to a hospital and later released police said.

“We can confidently say that the fentanyl that caused the overdose [of the juvenile] was the same fentanyl that was located in the juvenile’s bedroom” Hartford police said in the release.

The bags were initially collected by the Drug Enforcement Administration and given to Hartford police for fingerprint and DNA testing said Hartford police Lt. Aaron Boisvert.

Police found no evidence that anyone other than the child brought the drugs to school he added. Officials are still investigating how he came to be in possession of the fentanyl.

Authorities do not have a suspect at this time Boisvert told CNN.

The teen’s mother is cooperating with authorities who have found no evidence that suggests she had prior knowledge of her son’s fentanyl possession the release said.

The 13-year-old had no prior history of narcotics according to the release.

Pandemic might have made America’s drug epidemic worse

Fentanyl is 50 times more powerful than heroin and is extremely cheap to produce according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.

The US drug epidemic has exploded while Americans are locked down during the coronavirus pandemic.

From May 2020 through April 2021 more than 100000 people died from drug overdoses in the US according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s a record – a near-30% rise from a year earlier and a near doubling over the past five years. Synthetic opioids like fentanyl – 50-100 times more potent than morphine – accounted for the bulk of those deaths around 64000.

The drug epidemic has grown in tandem with the Covid-19 pandemic which killed about 509000 people in the same period.

“In a crisis of this magnitude those already taking drugs may take higher amounts and those in recovery may relapse. It’s a phenomenon we’ve seen and perhaps could have predicted” Dr. Nora Volkow director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse told CNN in an earlier report

The increasing use of the synthetic drug caught the attention of experts before Covid-19 hit but the pandemic may have exacerbated the problem Volkow says.

With international travel limited synthetics that are easier to manufacture and more concentrated were also more efficiently smuggled she adds.

By Ronni Newton

The Cetacean Society built Conny as a visible symbol of the organization’s “Save the Whale” effort and now they will garner their efforts to save Conny the organization’s president said.

David Kaplan an attorney who lives in West Hartford is president of the all-volunteer group Cetacean Society International which back in the 1970s when it was still known as the Connecticut Cetacean Society built the 45000-pound 62-foot-long replica of a giant sperm whale by hand in 1975-1976. It’s constructed of cement with a steel frame.

The whale’s name Conny is short for “Connecticut.”

Many of those original volunteers returned in 2016 for Conny’s 40th birthday party.

Building Conny was serious business and Kaplan is determined to find a new home for the sculpture now that it appears it will not be staying with The Children’s Museum when vacates the current site as early as this summer. Plans for Kingswood Oxford School which now owns the land where Conny and The Children’s Museum and its preschool sit to sell the property to Continental Properties for development of multifamily housing were announced last week.

“We didn’t build it to be a playscape” Kaplan said. “We built it to draw attention to the danger whales faced.” Conny however has become synonymous with The Children’s Museum and even appears on its logo.

Kaplan said the Cetacean Society has known for years that Conny would likely need to be relocated at some point and was prepared to launch a fundraiser for the move but he believed up until the plans were announced last week that the whale would go wherever The Children’s Museum went.

Michael Werle executive director of The Children’s Museum indicated it would be unlikely that Conny would be moving with the museum exhibits and preschool particularly since an initial move would be to temporary quarters while a final destination is created. Neither the temporary nor permanent locations have been announced.

“Conny is interesting” Werle told We-Ha.com last week. “It’s a conundrum we’re struggling with.”

“We harbor Conny but we don’t feel we own Conny” Werle said. “There’s a significant and broader ownership than us.” He said he would not want to see Conny destroyed.

Werle said there are numerous organizations including Cetacean Society International that have a vested interest in the sculpture. No one really knows who technically owns it.

Cost estimates are in the $175000 to $200000 range but according to Kaplan that’s based on moving the whale only a mile or so. Initially they thought The Children’s Museum might be moving to the former UConn campus property and renderings were prepared for that possibility with Conny prominently featured.

“Now we’re back to square one” said Kaplan. Cetacean Society International’s priorities are now focused on finding Conny a new home raising funds for a move and launching a groundswell of community support to assist. He doesn’t think the latter will be difficult since everyone seems to love the whale.

Kaplan said he’s been told there has already been a commitment for a $50000 donation to pay for the move but the cost of the move could change dramatically if a nearby location can’t be found.

Ideally he said the whale would be able to find a new home in West Hartford where it can continue to be appreciated by the community and used for educational purposes. According to information he’s received the whale could be transported by truck but moving it would involve removing its tail Kaplan said. The shorter the distance the better.

“Conny is an icon and means a lot to many of our residents – especially our young adults that grew up enjoying Conny” Mayor Shari Cantor told We-Ha.com. “We hope we can come up with a collaborative plan with support from our residents and find a new home for Conny.”

A “Save Conny the Whale and the Children’s Museum” change.org petition launched by the West End Civic Association has garnered more than 1000 signatures.

Dr. Robbins Barstow a co-founder of the Cetacean Society was the inspiration behind Conny Kaplan said. His goal was to draw attention to the plight of the whales and have the sperm whale chosen as a state symbol. At the time many members of the board at The Children’s Museum were also part of “Save the Whale” efforts and embraced the opportunity to have the statue on the campus which was owned by the Museum at the time.

“We could say we own the whale but we don’t have a home” said Kaplan of the Cetacean Society International. The headquarters is at his West Hartford house and pre-pandemic they would hold meetings at The Children’s Museum but those meetings are now virtual.

Conny was constructed as the “Save the Whale” movement was beginning and that movement still exists Kaplan said. As far as he knows Conny is the only concrete statue of a sperm whale anywhere in the world.

“We save real whales but now we’ve got to save a concrete whale too” Kaplan said. “We have to find a way.”

But Conny is now headed out into uncharted waters.

With the upcoming sale of the museum property for redevelopment and the museum’s move to another location Conny — originally conceived as a face for the “Save the Whale” movement rooted in the 1960s and 1970s and a life-size model of the sperm whale the state animal — now needs to find a new home.

Conny — measuring 60 feet and weighing 20 tons mostly of ferro-cement — has achieved iconic status in West Hartford since it was dedicated in 1976 the handiwork of volunteers and all donated materials.

The connection is so strong that an online petition drive in support of Conny and the museum has gathered more than 1000 signatures. “Save Conny the Whale” signs have popped up in West Hartford and Hartford’s West End.

Erin Sheehan who lives in Hartford’s West End remembers taking her son Kieran now 12 to the museum almost daily when he was young. Sheehan is among those who have displayed the save Conny signs at their homes.

Conny the Whale has been a favorite for younger children visiting the Children’s Museum in West Hartford.

“The whale is right out front” Sheehan said. “He ran up and down the whale listened to his voice echo through the whale’s cavernous body. We always waved to the whale as we drove by. It was part of our lives as a family.”

In West Hartford Jane Torrey said she is now bringing her grandchildren to visit the museum — and Conny — the second generation of her family to do so.

“We’ve spent a lot of time with that whale” Torrey said. “It’s a symbol. It would be very sad if we couldn’t figure out some way to do something with it.”

Expensive endeavor

Michael J. Werle the museum’s executive director said the prospect of having to move the museum twice the first to a temporary location the cost to move and refurbish the sculpture and make sure it meets modern building codes has proved at least so far to be too much.

Michael Werle the current director of the Children’s Museum in West Hartford said the museum would like to take Conny the Whale as the museum relocates but the cost to move and other issues stand in the way.

Werle also said it isn’t clear who actually owns the sculpture. It isn’t just the decision of the museum about what will happen with Conny he said.

“Giving up Conny is not trivial” Werle said. “Our preference is to bring Conny with us but we are facing a lot of challenges.”

Werle said the fate of Conny has been raised with state agencies including the office of arts and culture as well as tourism local legislators the Connecticut Historical Society the city of Hartford and the original builders of the whale the Cetacean Society International.

Conny has become integral to the museum over the years part of its logo and a big reason why many young visitors want to come to the museum.

The Children’s Museum in West Hartford is relocating to a temporary location in June now that its property on Trout Brook Drive near Farmington Avenue will be sold for redevelopment.

West Hartford Mayor Shari Cantor said Conny is certainly an attraction for the town of West Hartford but the whale is also a regional asset. So the solution — including the crucial financing of a move which by one estimate is $200000 — may have to reach beyond West Hartford and potentially include public contributions Cantor said.

“There’s an emotional attachment. It’s iconic a visual attachment and a real draw” Cantor said. “We would love to have a plan but alone I don’t know if the town could do it.”

Werle said there may be an appetite for donations noting that he’s had one verbal offer to contribute $50000 toward a move.

‘Save the Whale’

While Conny may now be known as more of a playscape of sorts that was not the original intention.

In the 1970s a fledgling group in Hartford formed the Connecticut Cetacean Society concerned about the plight of whales particularly the sperm whale which had been hunted almost to extinction for its oil.

The society — its name drawn from cetaceans which include whales dolphins and porpoises — was one of the first organized around the issue with the connection that Connecticut once had a thriving whaling industry.

“You go down to the seaport — Mystic Seaport — much of what you see is the whaling industry of 100 years ago” said David Kaplan a West Hartford attorney and president of nonprofit all-volunteer Cetacean Society International the successor to the original group.

The Science Center of Conn. in West Hartford held a celebration honoring the 20th birthday of their 60′ whale model named “Conny” in 1996.

The group was instrumental in the naming of the sperm whale as the state animal in 1975.

Conny — his name a shortened version of Connecticut — came to be built at the museum because the society held its outreach programs there. Some of the museum’s staff was supportive of the “Save the Whale” movement Kaplan said.

Hundreds of volunteers helped build Conny mixing cement by hand and slapping it on an armature made of wood and chicken wire.

“It was to be a symbol of the passive use of whales and all the harm that had been done to whales” Kaplan said. “The killing of whales should stop. It was a very strong symbol for the whale movement and to this day that mission is still with us.”

Sperm whales have come back from the brink Kaplan said but the right whale off the coast of New England is “close to extinction.”

Whaling still exists in some corners of the world. But today whales are now more at risk from strikes by cargo ships ingesting plastics and getting tangled in fishing gear and the climate change crisis Kaplan said.

In the years since Conny was built some of the connection back to being a symbol for saving whales has often been lost Kaplan said.

The museum shifted its focus to being more children-oriented Conny evolving into a mascot and playscape. Meanwhile the society turned its attention to the world stage.

Kaplan said Conny doesn’t necessarily have to stay with the museum and could find a home at say Mystic Seaport.

The sculpture was built on pedestals with the thought that one day Conny might have to be moved Kaplan said.

“But I think it should stay local” Kaplan said. “The movement started here and that’s why Conny is here. Conny just needs a home.”

Sheehan of Hartford said she understands there are costs to relocating something as huge as Conny but she believes there has to be a creative way to raise the needed funds.

“People in this area are still in pain over losing the Hartford Whalers and now we might lose Conny too?” Sheehan said. “Are you really going to do that to us too? Now are all our farm teams going to have to wear Conny the whale on them in addition to the Whalers colors? Everything that’s gotten taken away from us?”

Do you remember that preorder for the Black Ironhide from generations Selects? MSRP on that figure was $24.99. Now it could have meant two things. One that while this toy was labelled as a deluxe the higher price accounted for the extra accessory that didn't come with the Siege Ironhide mold which was also sold as a deluxe. Two that the MSRP for deluxes going forward would be 24.99. Well now we have more evidence for the latter. Firstly we have confirmation fromretailer Toysnowman that Hasbro has announced a price increase to retailers. You can check out their video below but here are thegoing forward:Deluxes 33.99 to 35.99Voyagers 44.99 to 47.99Leader 72.99-76.99Titan 249.99-264.99Secondly Marvelous News has reported that Marvel Legends 6"" figures will be going up to $24.99. Those toys are usually offered at the same price as deluxe Transformers figures and 6"" Black Series Star Wars figures. And that $24.99 is indeed the same price as that Generations Selects deluxe Guard.We do not have the specifics as to the US price increase for voyager core class leader commander and titan class Transformers but we are sure to find out soon.

Also maybe you were close to being done before this.



I'll be so close to retiring once we get all 5 Dinobots and all 3 main Insecticons.

Once I have those I could step away and be happy.

I'd like a new Astrotrain and Shockwave.

I could see dipping back in for those guys down the road. But yeah that will also depend on price appearance how annoying the play gimmick is etc.

But maybe the biggest temptation would be a new set of Constructicons...

Who knows... By the time that happens maybe I'll be able to justify the cost because I will have been out of the game for a while.

I could be wrong but this really feels like record fast timing for boosting the price again within a certain amount of time. Like there's usually either a very small price hike from year to year or one big price hike every trilogy or so. This is both a high price hike AND within a year of the last one. I'm not one to complain about these things but this may be where I start the steady decline to my cap on collecting TF's. Or as the user above me mentioned where I start getting REALLY selective about what I pick up. Which sucks cause sometimes I'm just in a bad mood and had a rough week at work and on the way home stop at Walmart to pick up a lil' deluxe to make my day better. If this is true it looks like the end of that for me. Dang. Posted by jtanimator on January 30th 2022 @ 1:35pm CST

Think of it this way. There's a lot of discussion about eliminating the use of oil. Oil is needed in the production of quality plastics. As political pressure continues to eliminate the use of fossil fuels and oil in general alternatives will need to be developed. Money needs to go into the research and most of the substitutes right now aren't any close to being as affordable as oil-based plastics. Combine that costs with supply chain issues and the ""environmental change in packaging"" (interesting because even with the plastic window the entire packaging for the last three TF lines has been 100% recyclable) plus increasing costs of production shipping and supplies and rising manpower costs and I wouldn't be surprised if deluxe prices were at $30 by the end of next year.



The only thing that can be fixed there right now is the supply chain and until SDV has run its course that's not going to happen. Think of it this way.

I'm curious to see when Pulse raises the prices on all the other figures to match whatever the new levels are. They eventually did this for everyone on their site for the last increase even figures produced before the last increase so it should be coming at some point.



Also interested to see if we get another reveal today and more importantly what the price is.

It’s easily one of the densest with multiple extensive timelines some of which even cross over. Amid all the tangled tales when the Michael Bay Transformer movies were at their height Hasbro set out to align its upcoming projects under a single umbrella — what has come to be aptly known as the Aligned Continuity. Aligned’s story stretches as far back as the War for Cybertron games yet it comes to a beautiful head with today’s featured series: Transformers: Prime.

Recommended Videos

After countless losses over the span of the war a handful of Autobots are all that’s left as Megatron descends upon Earth. At first the fighting involves striking from the shadows but the conflict builds over the animated show’s three seasons. The fight draws in three gifted human youngsters who join forces with Optimus Prime’s most loyal Autobots.

What could’ve been a fine but pedestrian Transformers show ends up being one of the nerdiest most detailed heavily nuanced depictions in the entire franchise. You know how I go on about how Disney’s Star Wars could go deeper? This is Transformers doing that. Unicron? He’s in this. The Omega Lock? Yep! The Star Saber? Hell yes. Predacons? You betcha!

And if you have no idea what any of those things are Transformers: Prime is the perfect way to learn about them. Everything’s modernized like in the Bayformer films but it’s nowhere near as gratuitous or dismissive of the weirder bits. This is a show that loves its source material and knows how to get you invested.

This melding of new and old guides Transformers: Prime in both storytelling and world-building. Like in classic animation of old the series kicks off with a five-part miniseries that works as a gradual introduction. They don’t kick things off with Transformers at its most Arthurian but with a humble set of stakes for both the Autobots and Decepticons. Meanwhile the trio of human characters though not especially nuanced offer an excellent audience surrogate.

In essence Transformers: Prime chooses the opposite of everything the Michael Bay films are. The humans are the foils to the more complex portrayals of the Autobots and Decepticons to the point that the humans are a single subplot among many by the series’s end. The art style is simple and clean yet it makes every visceral bit of Cybertronian gore all the more unnerving.

This is where the modern sensibilities seep in. The cast are no longer cardboard cutouts simply selling toys but nuanced warriors who’ve been fighting for centuries. They carry both visible and hidden scars each jarring you out of the mindset of Transformers: Prime just being “a kids’ show.”

When you see Arcee’s faceplate scratch open when interrogated by Airachnid you realize these characters can actually break. Witnessing Optimus lose his memory reverting to the humble librarian Orion Pax shows how anyone can aspire to heroism — or be led astray. M.E.C.H.’s monstrous hybridization of man and Cybertronian of their leader Silas shows that villainy isn’t exclusive to the Decepticons. Smokescreen initially a frankly annoying addition to the Autobot team gains significant pathos when faced with the opportunity to become the next Prime.

It’s astonishing how these are but a handful of examples of the striking moments Transformers: Prime offers. No stone is left unturned for the cast. Plus while never outright confirmed Bulkhead and Wheeljack’s implied relationship gave queer fans a ship to root for. This was bolstered by the Decepticon Knockout who presented a rare male equivalent to the femme fatale diva stereotype. Maybe it’s because they’re robots or because Transformers has become a rather LGBTQ+-friendly franchise of late. Either way for a 2010 TV show Prime manages to slip in some interesting and not-too-subtle nods that amused and intrigued fans.

Yet perhaps those who benefit most from Prime’s respect for its source material are the Decepticons. Megatron may never achieve the breadth of his arc in the IDW comics but across the three seasons and epilogue movie we see him brought low by his own villainy. The worker bot once known as D-16 strived to become the oppressor of his oppressors only for his dark designs to always cost him.

Meanwhile Starscream’s lust for power is made just as tragic. He once commanded respect and now is left desperately trying to recapture his glory days from before throwing in with Megatron. His betrayal of Megatron isn’t simply a desire to radically promote himself but pent-up fury and loathing directed at both his leader and his own miserable self.

There are several points in the series where Starscream almost manages a great plan or a point of growth beyond his pettiness yet he always relapses. His arc is a tragicomedy in a tailspin. Yet his dependency on a leader always holds him back. It wouldn’t be until Prime’s sequel series Robots in Disguise that Starscream would finally embrace his own agency even if he is ultimately bested by Bumblebee.

So many times when I talk about a project crafted with as much passion as Transformers: Prime there’s some caveat. The studio didn’t give the creators enough time or the audience wasn’t there or the budget was too tight. Yet by all appearances Hasbro took Prime as seriously as it did its feature films — maybe even more so. Not only did it get Peter Cullen and Frank Welker back as Optimus and Megatron but it filled out the entire cast with star-studded talent.

Seriously look at this lineup: Michael Ironside Tony Todd Ernie Hudson Gina Torres Jeffrey Combs Kevin Michael Richardson Sumalee Montano Nolan North Josh Keaton Daran Norris Peter Mensah and Will Friedle! Most animated TV shows could swing maybe a handful of actors of this caliber but Prime just flexes them all and everyone brings their A-game. This is up there with Orson Welles playing Unicron in 1986’s Transformers: The Movie.

Ultimately all Transformers: Prime needed to be was a glorified advertisement to get kids to buy action figures. Yet it manages to be so much more than that leaving a resounding impact on the franchise. Though the Aligned storyline is effectively wrapped up at this point its influence lingers warmly. The show is beloved by fans and I can understand why. Hell for me Prime was what got me to sit up and take the Transformers universe seriously. Paired with the efforts of IDW’s onslaught of comics the franchise has achieved what far bigger IPs still fumble with: staying relevant without losing touch with why anyone cared in the first place.

Or I suppose you could say they’ve still got “The Touch.”

Since the HasLab Proton Pack crowdfunding campaign succeeded in a massive way the Spengler Neutrona Wand has been in high demand. Why? Because you need it to complete the pack! That’s a nit-pick in its own right but that’s where we stand. The wand had been available long before Ghostbusters” Afterlife hit theatres and was sold out everywhere by the time HasLab announced the 1:1 scale prop replica was coming out.

So for months we’ve seen these things on eBay and other places going for well over $150. Hasbro recognized that it will probably have a lot of angry backers to deal with if the pack launches in 2023 and no one has the part needed to complete the thing.

The Neutrona Wand is again available on Hasbro Pulse for pre-order but the ship date isn’t until Spring 2023 right when the Proton Packs are due to ship. The wand is now priced at $124.99 and everything looks the same except for one huge orange difference. The tip of the thrower is now toy gun orange. Up. The thing that discharges your proton stream now has a safety plug.

Why is this necessary? The kiddy version that was released last year didn’t have this. It’s still clear plastic. Maybe this is just a precaution because Hasbro knows many cosplayers will be striding around with this somewhat gun-looking device in their hands next year? Maybe.

It’s really unsightly that this $125 replica now looks like a kid’s toy. Get a silver Sharpie pen and fix that issue right away when you get yours.

Aside from this change everything else looks to be the same. All of the lights sounds and functions are there including the multiple different effects from Ghostbusters: The Video Game. One thing I do hope Hasbro changes is the intensity level indicator lights. I dislike that it’s a sticker over a few LEDs rather than using the same part we see in the film and on the Matty Collector version of the wand.



With premium design and deco LEDs authentic sound effects motorized vibrations intensity adjustment stream extension with four unique bustin’ modes and display stand this Neutrona Wand roleplay item is so much fun it’s scary!

ICONIC GHOSTBUSTERS COLLECTIBLE: This Ghostbusters Plasma Series Spengler’s Neutrona Wand features premium design and deco based on the one seen in the 2021 film Ghostbusters: Afterlife

LIGHTS SOUNDS AND VIBRATIONS: LEDs authentic sound effects and motorized vibrations allow fans and collectors to imagine they’re wrangling all sorts of spooky spirits and gruesome ghouls

FOUR GHOST BUSTIN’ MODES: Prepare for any supernatural situation and cycle through four modes with the press of a button including classic Proton Stream Slime Blower Stasis Stream and Meson Collider modes

PREMIUM DESIGN: Featuring premium design and deco fans and collectors can display this premium roleplay item in their Ghostbusters collection while the orange tip deco allows fans to use the wand in cosplay and public environments

Where can I find the best places to go sledding in Pennsylvania?

Pennsylvania is one of those states where winter is seriously one of THE most fun times; part of the reason for this is that it’s an awesome place to grab a sled and go careening down a snowy hill. This awesome childhood winter pastime is easy in this state; luckily for us we’re surrounded by hills and embankments that are great for sledding. We do have some favorite locations just for this occasion though like the epic sledding hill at Codorus State Park. How many times do you think you can go in an hour? If you head to Frick Park located in Pittsburgh you can find Blue Slide Hill which is a local favorite. Then in the Philly area you might want to visit Fairmount Park for some of THE best sledding there is. Are you a lover of all things winter? Well then you might want to check out this article of all the things you need to add to your Pennsylvania winter bucket list ASAP.

Are there any ski resorts in Pennsylvania?

There most certainly are! With lots of snow and hills comes lots of resorts and we love it. Some of our favorite ski resorts in Pennsylvania include Liberty Mountain Ski Resort in Fairfield which is great for families with toddlers and small children. In Boswell head to the Laurel Mountain Ski Resort and while in Lehigh Valley you can’t miss the amazing Bear Creek Mountain Resort. Oh and we can’t end this without a nod toward our friends at Spring Mountain Adventures in – you guessed it – Spring Mount. Each of these places offers up memorable experiences you nor your family and/or friends will forget. One might even argue that winter is the best time to get outdoors and enjoy Pennsylvania.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWx0b2RheS5jb20vY2hvY29sYXRlLWRheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CHOCOLATE DAY - February 9 2025,"History of Chocolate Day

The history of chocolate consumption goes back around 2500 years. The Aztecs had recently discovered liquid chocolate and believed that the god of wisdom Quetzalcoatl had blessed them with it. Cocoa seeds were considered so valuable that they were even used as a form of currency. Back in those days flavorings in chocolate were scarce and it was consumed as a bitter drink. Chocolates would in fact be sugar-free until the 16th century when Europeans started adding sugar to them. This made chocolate more palatable and quickly caught on in the markets. It became one of many households’ favorite treats.

Many popular present-day chocolate companies started their operations in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Cadbury was founded in England in 1868 and today it is one of the leading chocolate brands. 25 years later Milton S Hershey started Hershey’s which is now one of the biggest and best-known chocolate brands in the world. Nestlé began its operations in the 1860s and has branched out to become one of the largest food conglomerates in the world. What started off as a drink took shape into a currency and has today become one of the biggest industries that not only generates incomes and employees hundreds of thousands of people across the world but produces food items that are loved by so many of us! Chocolate Day also celebrates the incredible versatility of this food ingredient.

On Chocolate Day lovers give each other heart-shaped chocolates as a symbol of love. Gifting chocolates to loved ones removes all the tensions and sorrows and improves the sweetness of the relationship."

The extradition of British technology tycoon Mike Lynch to the United States to answer criminal fraud charges has been approved by Home Secretary Priti Patel.

“On January 28 following consideration by the courts the extradition of Dr Michael Lynch to the US was ordered” a Home Office spokesperson said last night.

“Under the Extradition Act 2003 the Secretary of State must sign an extradition order if there are no grounds to prohibit the order being made. Extradition requests are only sent to the Home Secretary once a judge decides it can proceed after considering various aspects of the case” the spokesperson explained.

Chris Morvillo of law firm Clifford Chance representing Dr Lynch said in a statement after the Home Office announcement: “Dr Lynch firmly denies the charges brought against him in the US and will continue to fight to establish his innocence.

“He is a British citizen who ran a British company in Britain subject to British laws and rules and that is where the matter should be resolved.” Lawyer Chris Morvillo of law firm Clifford Chance representing Dr Lynch

“This is not the end of the battle — far from it. Dr Lynch will now file an appeal to the High Court in London” Morvillo said.

Earlier in the day

It comes after Dr Mike Lynch lost earlier yesterday a multibillion-dollar fraud action over the sale of his software company Autonomy to Hewlett Packard (HP) in 2011.

He is accused of deliberately overstating the value of his business before it was acquired by the American technology giant.

HP now Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) sued Dr Lynch and Autonomy’s former chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain for around £3.7bn following its purchase of the Cambridge-based firm for £8.3bn more than a decade ago.

Announcing his decision on the case at the High Court in London on Friday Mr Justice Hildyard said HP had “substantially succeeded” in its various claims against the two men – but is likely to receive “substantially less” than the amount claimed in damages.

Dr Lynch has denied all charges against him and has signalled he intends to appeal against the High Court judge’s decision.

That decision coincided with a deadline for the Home Secretary to decide whether Dr Lynch should be extradited to the US.

Extradition proceedings

On Wednesday Ms Patel was given until midnight on Friday to decide on his extradition after a High Court judge ruled against Dr Lynch’s legal challenge over a previously set deadline.

Patel had wanted to consider Mr Justice Hildyard’s ruling on the High Court civil claim before making an extradition decision.

US authorities claim Dr Lynch deliberately overstated the value of his business which specialised in software to sort through large data sets.

Earlier Kelwin Nicholls another lawyer at Clifford Chance representing the entrepreneur said after the High Court judge’s decision: “Today’s outcome is disappointing and Dr Lynch intends to appeal.

“We will study the full judgment over the coming weeks. We note the judge’s concerns over the reliability of some of HP’s witnesses.

“We also note the judge’s expectation that any loss suffered by HP will be substantially less than the five billion dollars (£3.8 billion) claimed.”

Mr Justice Hildyard delivered a summary of his conclusions in the case on Friday more than two years after the start of what was believed to be the UK’s biggest civil fraud trial – which was heard over nine months in 2019.

He said Dr Lynch and Hussain gave a “misleading picture” of the business including by “reselling” hardware in order to enable Autonomy to cover shortfalls in software revenue.

The judge said: “The purpose of the hardware selling strategy was to meet market expectations of revenue maintenance and growth by misleading the market as to the true market position of Autonomy.

“These loss-making transactions were not commercially justified on any basis.

“The justifications advanced by the defendants were no more than pretexts to increase stated revenue in the accounts.

“The strategy was not for the purpose of raising software revenue sales. That justification was a pretence fashioned principally for the audit committee and Deloitte who would not have approved the accounting treatment without the pretence.

“Both concealment of the hardware sales and their true cost in Autonomy’s accounts and other published information were necessary because revelation of the Autonomy’s use of hardware sales and the erosion of gross margin would have nullified their true purpose.

“This would have exposed that Autonomy’s software business was not generating the accelerating revenue and profits which the market thought it was and which heavily influenced its price.” Mr Justice Hildyard

The judge said Autonomy was founded in 1996 out of a company called Cambridge Neurodynamics an early venture into using “machine learning” to develop software techniques which Dr Lynch had explored in his PhD thesis at Cambridge University.

His full judgment in the case is expected to be published at a later date but remains embargoed until then.

During the civil trial in 2019 HP said the write-down of Autonomy’s value was because it had found “serious accounting improprieties”.

Laurence Rabinowitz QC representing HP said Dr Lynch and Hussain had knowingly caused Autonomy to “engage in a programme of widespread and systematic fraudulent” accounting practices ahead of the sale.

He said Autonomy had been “meeting its revenue and revenue growth targets by simply buying and selling third-party hardware without any connection to Autonomy software”.

Rabinowitz added the firm also used “a variety of other fraudulent devices” to either accelerate revenue or to invent revenue that never existed in the first place.

The two men denied the claims and Dr Lynch launched a counter-claim for at least 125 million US dollars (£95 million) in damages against HP for “a series of false misleading and unfair public statements” about his alleged responsibility for supposed accounting irregularities and misrepresentations at Autonomy.

He accused HP of “making a series of far-fetched allegations of fraud and scapegoating” arguing it had “destroyed one of the most successful and promising software companies of its time due to management incompetence politics and infighting”.

Dr Lynch from Suffolk argued the technology giant was trying to make him “a scapegoat for their failures”.

Mr Hussain was convicted in April 2018 in the US of wire fraud and other crimes related to Autonomy’s sale and was sentenced to five years in prison.

HLT,Hilton Worldwide,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR1cm5pbmdsZWZ0Zm9ybGVzcy5jb20vY29ucmFkLWhpbHRvbi1ob3RlbHMtcmVzb3J0cy13b3JsZC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Conrad & Hilton hotels Resorts World Las Vegas review,"This is my review of the Conrad & Hilton hotels at Resorts World Las Vegas on the strip from my stay in December 2021.

Finally Vegas has a decent selection of upscale Hilton’s in good locations to choose from. A new development called Resorts World opened last summer and contains three Hilton properties – Conrad Hilton and LXR (Crockfords). I stayed at the Conrad and Crockfords but in this review I will also cover Hilton since all the facilities are shared and I saw a few of the Hilton rooms for comparison.

Location and transport

The location of Resorts World is not ideal if you plan to go out and about a lot. It’s near Circus Circus at the northern end of the strip. There’s the legendary Peppermill opposite which is an old-school diner and cocktail lounge. It’s around 15-20 minutes walk to Encore Wynn and the Fashion Show Mall.

Now generally this wouldn’t be an issue as there’s plenty on-site. However the Uber situation is a pain in the backside. It’s fine when you get dropped off as they drop you off at reception right near the guest elevators. But when you order an Uber it’s quite a trek. You have to walk through the entire casino go outside and walk a bit further to a deserted parking lot. I was there in winter and it wasn’t much fun standing in the cold in a dimly parking lot on my own at night. Most other hotels have somewhere with patio heaters close to the entrance or in a garage. It’s worth bearing in mind that Crockfords does allow pick-ups from reception but it’s not an option in Uber so you have to message your driver. This is only for those staying at Crockfords.

Check-in

Conrad does have digitals keys so if you can get away with this I’d recommend it. There was consistently a line at reception at all times of day even though I was staying at the quietest time of the year. I have Hilton Diamond status and even in the priority queue I was waiting at least 15 minutes to speak to someone.

When I finally checked in the agent explained about the Hilton Diamond and Hilton Impressario (see below) perks which included free breakfast (up to $25pp for Hilton and $30pp for Impressario) and $100 hotel credit. The Hilton credit can be spent at any time of day but given that it was restricted to two restaurants that closed by the afternoon it was a choice of breakfast or lunch.

He neglected to mention that you had to spend the $100 all in one go which then meant I ended up wasting some of it. Plus if you are on your own $100 is quite a lot to spend in one go. This is not a requirement I have seen before. I was told I had an upgrade but in fact I hadn’t it was the standard room. I was there at a weekend so I’m guessing it was busy. Friends that arrived for a shorter stay on the Sunday were upgraded to the one-bedroom suite.

I found the Bell Desk staff quite rude. As I was only swapping from another hotel in the complex I got the Crockfords to transfer the luggage but when I went to the bell desk to say I’ve got my room number now I was frowned at. I was told I must go to my room and then call them to get the luggage even though it wouldn’t take more than two minutes to get there! This is obviously a ploy to get tips so you are in the room to give them money! Of course I did that and then no one answered the phone….However the porters themselves I encountered were all friendly and helpful.

The hotel is full of quirky artwork and Vegas momentoes like Liberace’s famous piano.

The rooms

I’ll review a few different rooms since I went back and asked to be upgraded for my last night having heard about how great the suites were from my friends. Plus I’ll take a look at the Hilton rooms. The good news is that the lifts for the hotel rooms are right by reception which is not the case in my hotels that make you walk for miles.

Conrad – Strip View Premium One Bed

All the rooms are resorts world are very similar with slightly different decor and features. The Conrad rooms feel very modern but rather masculine for my taste with the red and grey. The room was definitely a generous size but like many Vegas hotels did not have a coffee machine. This is because they want you out spending money. Instead there was a minibar and water was provided due to my status. One thing I liked which is unusual for Vegas was that the fridge had a smaller half-section as well as the minibar so you could store your own items.

I liked that there was a full-size table for eating although it was the only space to work and a bit of a stretch to the power sockets.

The bed was as comfortable as the Crockfords one and there was both USB USB-C and a normal socket by the bedside. The clock radio as had a wireless charging point on top which was clever.

There’s plenty of storage with a big closet massive chest of drawers and an area to put your case rather than use the annoying racks that can’t accommodate a two-sided case (the hotel industry needs to catch up with the fact that most larger cases are two-sided.

The bathroom felt luxurious with marble finishes although I did miss having a bath to soak my Vegas weary body in. Up until a few years ago most hotels had baths in the rooms but now they seem to be switching to shower only which is annoying. I liked the twin sink area which was well lit with a magnifying mirror as well. Strangely Conrad has a rain shower head but Crockfords which is more expensive doesn’t. There was also a seat area in the shower should you be so exhausted by Vegas you need to sit down!! It’s also handy for shaving your legs!

The toiletries in all three hotels are the same which is great for the Hilton in terms of quality. They were in large containers that could not be removed. I actually have no issue with this although it’s a bit annoying not to be able to have the body lotion by the bed where I normally put it on my hands before I go to sleep! I did like having a large bottle of handwash by the sink though as I much prefer it to soap.

The toiletries are by Byredo a luxury Swedish perfume company with toiletries starting at around £40. They are used in Emirates first class too. The Mojave Ghost fragrance is used in all the hotels to reflect the nearby Mojave Desert. There is a rare “ghost” flower in the Mojave desert that can develop with almost no water that the fragrance is named after. It is a slightly musky scent which I wasn’t particularly keen on but the products were great quality.

Conrad – one-bedroom suite

As I mentioned I managed to finally get my upgrade (I was entitled to one on both the Hilton Diamond and Impressario rates.) One tip is that if you stay for more than one night or at a busy time then you probably won’t get an upgrade. However if it is then quieter there’s nothing to stop you asking again if you don’t mind switching rooms.

Now this room was something special and if I was to stay again I’d only stay at the Conrad if I could get one of these at a decent price. It was worlds apart from the standard room. For a start it had a Nespresso coffee machine. It also had electronic curtains.

You enter into the sitting area which is enormous and had great views of the strip.

The bedroom was very similar to the previous room and both the sitting area and bedroom had huge TVs.

However there were a few more surprises in store. There was a walk-in closet with a dressing table area which I loved and was perfect for getting glammed up for a Vegas night out! The light mirror was handy too.

And finally in my bathroom I got a wonderful bath! There were also twin sinks in this bathroom and a separate shower and toilet. It was lovely that you got a little rubber duck soap for the bath an a loofah.

Hilton standard queen room

I have to say I was impressed by the Hilton rooms which are only slightly smaller than the Conrad ones. Although I’m not convinced by that carpet but it can probably hide a multitude of stains.

The bathroom was also particularly luxurious for a Hilton in fact if anything I preferred the decor to the Conrad bathroom. The only real difference was the lack of a shaving mirror.

The Hilton also has some great suites which may be a little cheaper than the Conrad. Here’s the Hilton Two Bedroom Entertainment Suite.

Food and drink

Overall there’s a lot of choice with some good options but breakfast really lets it down. Room service is also annoying. Breakfast can only be taken at Sun’s Out Bun’s Out or The Kitchen. Sun’s out Bun’s out is similar to the popular Egg Slut with egg buns of various descriptions plus burgers and avocado toast with eggs. However upmarket it is not. The other option of The Kitchen has a small buffet plus a la carte options but struggles to cope with the numbers of people leading to lengthy queues.

While Resorts World has numerous fantastic food options it lacks an upscale breakfast cafe such as Bouchon Veranda or Tableau. Every morning I was there I had a choice of stand in a queue for twenty to thirty minutes or pay a huge mark up for delivery to my room with a limited menu.

I tried Sun’s Out Bun’s Out for lunch instead one day and it was OK but nothing special and not really what I’d expect from a Conrad breakfast. You also have to pick up your orders from two different places if you order a drink. You could skip the queue if you could make do with a coffee and a donut for breakfast.

I never actually managed to last the 30 minutes to get into the Kitchen but I have not heard good reports from those that did. The main issue is that the hotel has over 3000 rooms and the capacity of the two restaurants is not nearly big enough. I estimate there are around 30 tables in The Kitchen which is just ridiculous for that many rooms. There are two Starbucks but only one was open and had huge queues.

Room service was also not great. Basically there is no traditional room service. You have to download an app that’s like Deliveroo and then order from there with a $8.50 delivery charge. You can order from anywhere in the hotel which is good but the menus are limited. For example here are the breakfast options for the Kitchen:

And as you can see from the drinks you can’t get any sort of juice or tea with your breakfast either.

I couldn’t face the whole queue situation after having headed down to check whether it would be any quieter on a Monday (not really gave up after 10 minutes of not moving in the queue) so I went for room service. One advantage is that they are quicker than other hotels with around 20-30 minutes being the average. Another thing to be wary of is that you have to tick a box to get cutlery which is not obvious and then if you forget there is no way to contact the courier. Which led to me having to try and eat noodles with my hands later on. Yuck!

As you can see it’s not the normally sort of room service presentation I’d expect from a Conrad. It was tasty enough though but then it should be at $37.88 in total! It was a breakfast burrito in case you are not sure what it was!

I also tried Wallys which is an upscale wine and truffle focussed restaurant overlooking the Sphere attraction. Wally’s also serves breakfast but only seemed to have the all day menu available when I was there. Now it opens at 7am and does offer breakfast.

I started with the Truffle Caesar salad which looked great but was a little underwhelming due to the lack of dressing and tricky to eat.

I then went for the steak tartare with caviar which I really enjoyed and felt very indulgent.

They also have a separate cheese and charcuterie menu so I would head back for that and to try some more of the wine selection since they have a great wine list with 8000 labels of wine.

There’s also Famous Foods which could loosely be described as a luxury world food court. Here high-quality stalls serve a wide variety of dishes from hand-pulled dan-dan noodles to Italian sandwiches. You can also have this delivered to your room via the Grubhub app. I tried some great Dan Dan noodles from one of the stalls. There’s also a hidden entrance to the Speakeasy bar amongst the stalls and the so-called “disco” bathroom.

I didn’t have time to sample any more restaurants but there are a plethora of choices including Italian Japanese Chin

ese or steak.

In terms of bars there’s the Crystal bar right in the center of the casino as well as Gatsby cocktail lounge and my favourite the Allē Lounge on 66 on the rooftop which has stunning 360-degree views of Vegas chilled live music and feels very upmarket. I’d say it’s one of the nicest bars I have been to in Vegas. They also serve small plate food.

The pools

The pools are one of Resorts World’s main attractions with the Vegas strip’s only infinity pool plus the largest pool complex on the Strip with seven pools in total. There’s also the family pool the Bimini game pool with submerged loungers and hot tub the main pool and a cabana pool. This is another reason I’d consider coming back.

I swam in the Bimini pool in December and it was well heated. There’s also a lovely infinity pool but you do have to rent a cabana to sit by it.

Other facilities and entertainment

I didn’t get a chance to visit the spa but it looked great and you can get a day pass for $100 if you don’t want a treatment. AWANA has six different vitality pools heated Crystal laconium room tepidarium chairs vapor-filled steam rooms cool mist showers and the experiential Rain Walk. As well as the thermal pools there is also a unique “Event sauna” where you get aromatherapy choreographed with music lighting and dancing towels for an extra $40.

In terms of entertainment they have a large theatre with big headliners doing residencies such as Katy Perry and Michael Bublé. There’s also a nightclub and a day club pool party.

Booking

I originally booked on points since I am swimming in them and had already made Diamond that year. That was when the price was around $250 a night. Then nearer the time the price plummeted to around $89 a night so it was stupid not to pay cash. However although prices are cheap you need to factor in the $45 resort fee per night and taxes. Prices start from 35000 points for the Conrad or 32000 for the Hilton. Cash prices start from around $140 for the Hilton and $160 for the Conrad mid-week.

You can search prices and book here for the Conrad. The Hilton Las Vegas website is here.

I mentioned that I had booked through Hilton Impressario. This is a service offered by luxury travel agents such as our partners GTC.

With Impressario you get added benefits and all your status perks and points. (Available on Waldorf Astoria LXR and Conrad brands).

Complimentary Breakfast for 2 people

$100 USD hotel credit per stay or local currency equivalent

Next category upgrade subject to availability

Double Hilton Honors points

The rates are higher than the cheapest advance rate but you can change up to one day before which you can’t on an advance rate.

Conclusion

I found the Conrad a mixed bag. It was definitely not up to the standard of other Conrads particularly in terms of the front desk and breakfast options. Given the low prices it was great value for money and I like some of the design features of the hotel which means that you don’t need to walk through the casino to get to reception/your room or the pools. The rooms were spacious and well equipped apart from the lack of coffee. Unless you are going to go for a suite I don’t really see the point of paying much more for the Conrad since all the facilities are the same and the rooms are only slightly smaller. Obviously you can get the Hilton Impressario deal on the Conrad which may tip the balance.

I will also be writing a short review of Crockfords as it is quite different to the Conrad and Hilton. That would probably be my first choice if I returned or one of the Conrad Suites.

You can find more information here for the Conrad. The Hilton Las Vegas website is here.

Four months later the resort’s owner announced a remodeling.

In 2022 workers are completing the most recent refurbishment of the Partridge intended to greet visitors for this year’s Masters Tournament.

Augusta’s landmark hotel always seems to be undergoing renovations or remodeling. But that’s the nature of the hotel business.

“You have to stay competitive. There are new hotels coming in every single day” said Holly White who became the Partridge’s new general manager in December. “It’s slowed down a little bit with COVID but there are new brands being introduced and everything else and you have to stay competitive and make sure you’re ever-evolving and improving for your guests.”

The Partridge’s 1910 remodel – a proposed addition of 50 guest rooms – carried a $30000 price tag The Augusta Chronicle reported at the time.

The latest remodel is budgeted at $10 million and is being called a “top-to-bottom update"" of the hotel’s 143 guest rooms and many public spaces by Atlanta-based NorthPointe Hospitality Management which runs the Partridge.

Local hotel occupancy numbers seem to be bouncing back. Occupancy peaked last July which beat out April 2021 and the return of the Masters after its 2020 postponement until November of that year according to a Georgia Hotel Industry Report prepared by investment management company Colliers.

Augusta’s 71.6% occupancy rate was the highest for the entire metro area in more than 20 years the report said.

What makes it unique?

The hotel is part of Hilton Worldwide Holdings' Curio Collection a brand of the international hospitality chain that markets one-of-a-kind boutique hotels.

The Partridge’s age and its eclectic architecture set it apart from more modern hotels’ rooms that have almost-identical floor plans. The Partridge’s outside eaves create rooms with slanted ceilings inside such that the layout of many of the rooms is unique.

“I think people will like that we're getting back to the more traditional historic roots” White said. “That was something I heard time and time again that the inside didn’t necessarily match the outside. Now I feel that it will.”

When the coronavirus pandemic sapped revenue from hotels in 2020 the Partridge had to suspend some property upkeep.

“This is obviously an over-100-year-old building” White said. “You can’t (disregard) preventive maintenance and not having those revenues forced harder decisions.”

Running an older historical hotel tends to cost more than operating a more contemporary building. Maintenance expenses on older properties average 30.1% higher energy costs run 17.7% higher and insurance costs almost 50% higher according to an analysis conducted by PKF Hospitality Research in 2014.

The Partridge has undergone various renovations as ownership changed through the decades. After being spared from demolition in the 1980s it reopened as apartment house Partridge Place but became a hotel again in 1989. In 1995 it underwent renovations to expand the number of rooms temporarily to 155. New owners completed another renovation in 2006. Five years later the hotel went into foreclosure and saw another round of repairs and upgrades in 2013 and 2014.

More recently the COVID-spurred downtime later allowed time for more property improvements. About 175 of the Partridge’s windows are being repainted reglazed or refabricated. A $6 million renovation completed in 2016 improved much of the hotel but not all.

“With the 2015-2016 renovation a lot of the plumbing the things inside the walls were really taken care of then which was good” White said. “But the exterior of the building has just not been maintained as it needed to be for the age of the building so that's why you see all the stucco work replacing rotten boards.”

Water intrusion posed another recent renovation challenge. Leaks under the hotel’s veranda would routinely flood the first floor. Recent improvements have kept the first floor bone-dry through several recent rainfalls White said.

Charm plus convenience

A hotelier typically executes a PIP or property improvement plan about every five years White said. The International Society of Hospitality Consultants estimates the frequency at every five to seven years.

During a renovation proprietors of older hotels such as the Partridge can find themselves performing a balancing act to maintain a property’s historical charm while still offering modern convenience according to Dr. Scott Smith associate professor in the University of South Carolina’s College of Hospitality Retail and Sport Management.

“When we're talking about historic buildings people are looking for a totally different experience. But in the hotel business you’ve got to be about cleanliness” Smith said. “No matter how historic it is nobody wants to stay in something that looks tired and unclean so that's part of a whole renovation as well. You keep it looking fresh but again there are ways to do it while keeping the historical motif of the rooms.”

Also not all renovations are the same he said. A “soft-goods” redo tends to deal with replacing items such as linens and furniture – costs created by guests’ routine use. More extensive improvements such as painting or fixture replacements often require closing a few guest rooms while repairs are completed.

The Partridge’s current renovation is about as big as it gets. The hotel’s penthouse formerly with four bedrooms and a dining room that seated 12 is being remade into Six South a lounge with indoor and outdoor bars and a full kitchen. Six South will retain the distinctive balcony that offers sweeping views down Walton Way of Augusta’s skyline.

The Partridge’s second floor will be a restaurant called 8595 taking its name from the years 1785 to 1795 when Augusta served as Georgia’s capital.

Also for the first time in its history the hotel will have its own bridal suite for booked weddings. The suite with its own courtyard will be in a guest room formerly occupied by the hotel’s sales office.

About 30 rooms at the Partridge are still available for Masters Week April 4-10 White said. Lodging during the tournament typically generates about half of the hotel’s revenue for the entire year she said.

Smith said that while a decline in business travel is still affecting hotel occupancy resort hotels are enjoying a profitable year with numbers “going through the roof” because of consumers eager to shake off COVID-19 isolation.

“It seems kind of counterintuitive with COVID but people just want to get out"" he said. “If you can offer them a safe clean environment from COVID and something interesting then you certainly can benefit from that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzMwL3JlYWRlci1xdWVzdGlvbi1oaWx0b24tZmItY3JlZGl0LXdoZW4tbm8tcmVzdGF1cmFudHMtb3BlbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reader Question: Hilton F&B Credit When No Restaurants Open?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2022/01/30/reader-question-hilton-fb-credit-when-no-restaurants-opens/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzMwL3JlYWRlci1xdWVzdGlvbi1oaWx0b24tZmItY3JlZGl0LXdoZW4tbm8tcmVzdGF1cmFudHMtb3BlbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS91bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtcGFydG5lcnMtZ3VpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your ultimate guide to United Airlines partners,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

United's non-alliance airline partners

(Photo by Nicky Kelvin/The Points Guy)

United also maintains a handful of non-alliance partnerships with various airlines. These partnerships let United customers gain access to even more cities around the world. You can earn and redeem miles with these partners in most cases though some may have restrictions.

For example you can only earn and redeem United miles on intra-island Hawaiian Airlines flights. Hawaiian Airlines flights from the mainland U.S. are not eligible to earn United miles and cannot be booked with United miles. But when you book United flights from the continental U.S. to Hawaii on miles an inter-island flight on Hawaiian Airlines could be ""free"" thanks to United's excursionist perk.

Here's a look at all of United's non-alliance airline partners:

Aer Lingus.

AeroMar.

Air Dolomiti.

Airlink.

Azul.

Boutique Air.

Cape Air.

Edelweiss.

Eurowings.

Earning United miles with partners

From airlines to car rental companies United has a ton of different partners that you can earn and redeem miles with. Here's a quick overview:

Earning miles with United airline partners

You can earn United miles when you add your MileagePlus number to flights operated by any one of United's various partners. You'll earn miles based on how much you spend if United issues your ticket (booked through United.com) and distance flown if a partner tickets your flight.

The number of miles you'll earn on partner tickets depends on the airline you're flying the fare class you're booked in and your United Premier status level. For example a Lufthansa flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Frankfurt (FRA) booked in N fare premium economy would earn 5806 miles as N fares earn 100% mileage flown. This is because the flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Frankfurt Germany (FRA) is 5806 miles.

(Screenshot from united.com)

Each United Premier status level gets its own mileage bonus on partner flights. Silver Gold Platinum and 1K elites earn 25% 50% 75% and 100% bonus miles on partner tickets respectively. So if you're a Premier 1K member you'd earn 11612 United miles on the LAX-FRA ticket mentioned earlier.

You can also earn Premier qualifying points (PQPs) and Premier qualifying flights (PQFs) from United's partners. However note that some fare classes may be ineligible for mileage credit. Furthermore United has limited the PQPs you can earn on a given flight.

You can view the earning rates for all of United's airline partners on United's website. Review these pages closely — sometimes airlines restrict mileage earning to specific routes and fare classes.

Hotel partnerships

United has partnerships with most major hotel chains. Some earn a set number of United miles per stay while others earn miles based on how much you spend at a given hotel.

United flyers can also take advantage of discounts up to 35% with Avis and Budget using their respective discount numbers. However our tests only found 5-8% discounts when using these codes.

Earning miles with United credit cards

United Airlines has an exclusive partnership with Chase to issue credit cards in the U.S. Each of these cards offers various perks points earning rates and sign-up bonuses. Plus you can use these cards to earn United miles on everyday purchases.

Here's an overview of the currently available United personal cards and their bonuses:

United Gateway Card : Earn 30000 bonus miles after you spend $1000 on purchases in the first three months your account is open.

Of these cards the United Explorer Card is one of the most popular.

It includes two one-time United Club passes per year a free first checked bag and priority boarding on United flights.

More frequent United flyers may opt for the higher-end United Club Infinite Card. This card has a higher $525 annual fee but includes a full United Club membership and Premier Access on all United flights. Even better you'll earn 4 miles per dollar spent on United purchases 2 miles per dollar spent on all other travel and dining and 1 mile per dollar spent on everything else.

The United Gateway Card on the other hand earns 2 miles per dollar spent on United purchases gas stations local transit and commuting and 1 mile per dollar spent on everything else. The card has no annual fee so it can be a good option for infrequent travelers.

Transferring miles from Chase Ultimate Rewards

One of our favorite ways to earn United miles is through Chase Ultimate Rewards. You can transfer your Ultimate Rewards points to United at a 1:1 ratio meaning that 10000 Ultimate Rewards points are equal to 10000 United miles.

In many cases earning United miles through Chase Ultimate Rewards credit cards is more lucrative than spending on one of the United cards we mentioned earlier. While you don't get airline-specific benefits like checked bags you can earn more miles on everyday purchases. And you can transfer your Ultimate Rewards points to other airlines if you find a better mileage deal.

Redeeming miles on partner flights

(Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy)

United recently switched to dynamic award pricing for all partner award tickets. The price of most partner awards went up by at least 10% in early 2020 making United miles significantly less valuable for partner awards. Regardless it's good to have the option to redeem miles on these flights if you have miles available to you.

That said United generally prices award space on its planes lower than flights operated by partners. Unfortunately United charges additional miles if you connect from a United flight to a partner flight.

(Screenshot from united.com)

For example you could book a flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Oslo Norway (OSL) via Zurich (ZRH) for 33000 United miles one-way in economy class. In this example itinerary United operates the SFO to ZRH segment and Swiss operates the ZRH to OSL segment. United would charge 30000 miles for just the SFO to ZRH flight so you are paying an extra 3000 miles for the inter-Europe flight.

Still this means that you can leverage United's partner flight network to fly to destinations not served by United for not too many additional miles. Essentially you can fly to just about anywhere in the world using your United miles.

You can find award space for virtually all United partners on the United website. This includes non-alliance partners like Aer Lingus and Hawaiian Airlines as well as all of the carrier's Star Alliance partners. United's website is often considered the best Star Alliance search tool.

Reciprocal elite status benefits

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

All United Premier elites get reciprocal benefits on all Star Alliance carriers. United Premier Silver members are eligible for Star Alliance Silver status while United Premier Gold and above are eligible for the more lucrative Star Alliance Gold status. These benefits can make your flight experience easier when flying on partner carriers.

To take advantage of your Star Alliance benefits when flying partners just add your United MileagePlus number to a partner booking. Here's a look at both Star Alliance Silver and Star Alliance Gold benefits:

Star Alliance Silver

Star Alliance Silver status is pretty bare bones. It includes very minimal benefits that while helpful won't drastically change your airport experience.

These benefits include:

Priority wait-listing: If your desired class of service isn't available at the time of booking your status gives you higher priority on the waitlist. This does not apply to award tickets.

If your desired class of service isn't available at the time of booking your status gives you higher priority on the waitlist. This does not apply to award tickets. Priority airport standby: Your status gives you higher priority on the standby list for your preferred flight except when you are traveling on an award ticket. This can be helpful if you want to fly on an earlier flight.

Star Alliance Gold

Things get more interesting with Star Alliance Gold status. These members are eligible for more tangible benefits like lounge access and priority security.

Here's a look at the full suite of Star Alliance Gold benefits:

Gold Track security: You can use dedicated Gold Track security lanes before Star Alliance flights.

Bottom line

United has a slew of different partners making it one of the easiest airlines with which to earn miles. We highly recommend starting with a Chase Ultimate Rewards card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card if you're just beginning your mileage journey. After all you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to United (and other programs).

When it comes to redeeming miles you'll get the best deals by redeeming United miles for flights operated by United. However you can still leverage the airline's vast partner network to redeem miles if United doesn't serve your destination of choice.

The actor was spotted making his way out of a Home Depot in the Pasadena neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday.

And from the looks of the messy outfit he was wearing that project has likely included some sort of painting although on this day he did not appear to buy any paint products.

Hands on home improvement: Shia LaBeouf 35 was seen walking out of a Home Depot in the Pasadena neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday

The Transformers star 35 was seen making his way around the home improvement retailer casually grabbing a number of items in a black hoodie seemingly doused in paint and/or spackling.

He also wore matching sweatpants that also had remnants of paint splattered on the front and back.

In keeping with his casual work ensemble LaBeouf donned a pair of Nike sneakers that also looked like they had been worn during some home improvement projects.

The Los Angeles native appears to be going with the shaggy look with a grown out beard and mustache combo that was slightly unkempt.

After paying for about a half dozen small items The Peanut Butter Falcon star made his way outside for the walk to his parked vehicle while still wearing a protective mask amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

He would pull off the face mask off by the time he made it to his car for the ride back home.

Not pictured with LaBeouf was his 'pregnant' fiancée Mia Goth.

The couple are rumored to be expecting their first child together so there's more than a possibility that he could be working on their pending bundle of joy's bedroom.

The couple have been seen out together a number of times recently where the mom-to-be tried to cover up her possible baby bump by wearing oversized shirt.

Safety first: The actor wore a face mask in the store and then pulled it off before arriving back at his parked vehicle

The British model and actress met LaBeouf on the set of the erotic art film Nymphomaniac in 2012 and eventually got married by an Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas in October 2016.

LaBeouf filed for divorce in 2018 but it's been unclear if the union was actually fully dissolved or even legally binding especially after a Twitter account for Clark County Nevada tweeted that the actors merely had a non-binding commitment ceremony with the Elvis impersonator.

After reportedly doing the 'on-and-off' relationship the pair have seemingly been back 'on' as a couple since March 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvcmV2aWV3ZWQvMjAyMi8wMS8zMC9hcHBsaWFuY2UtZGVhbHMtc2hvcC1wcmVzaWRlbnRzLWRheS1zYWxlcy1iZXN0LWJ1eS1hbmQtc2Ftc3VuZy85Mjc1Njc1MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All the best early Presidents' Day appliance sales at Best Buy Lowe's Samsung and The Home Depot,"— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Port of Spain mayor Joel Martinez. File photo/Sureash Cholai

Almost a year after the ground floor at the Riverside Plaza carpark Port of Spain was handed over to the corporation to get the socially displaced off the streets it is one step closer to being open.

This came after Port of Spain mayor Joel Martinez said the parties have mediated and agreed to work together.

The facility remained closed as Anthony Salloum founder of the NGO Homeless Assistance Office and Martinez could not find common ground.

But in a statutory council meeting on Friday Martinez said ""We have drawn plans and agreed to do various things and the parties come together to be able to manage and eradicate homelessness in Port of Spain.""

Next Friday will be the last virtual mediation session. When contacted Salloum told Newsday discussions are going well and he is ready to move forward.

When the facility was identified as a temporary centre to get the homeless off the streets Salloum asked for part of it to open an office to assist displaced people.

Two weeks after Minister of Social Development and Family Services Donna Cox handed over the facility to the corporation Salloum clashed with Martinez after the mayor told Newsday on May 27 he would only hand over the keys if Salloum and a homeless man Hugh Bernard dropped an ongoing court appeal against the corporation.

Cox intervened andMartinez eventually handed over the key but the facility remained closed.

The discord between the men began six years after the matter was brought before the court. Bernard a socially displaced man went to court with Salloum as a witness after former mayor Raymond Tim Kee and members of the corporation decide to instal padlocks on the gates around Tamarind Square east Independence Square to keep out the homeless.

During cross-examination the mayor and corporation claimed the presence of homeless people made the square unsanitary and impassable to the public.

The corporation denied deciding to lock all the gates to the square.

Bernard claimed there was no civilised alternative to the square and conditions at the Socially Displaced Centre downtown Port of Spain were inhumane and unsafe.

The judgment delivered by Justice Eleanor J Donaldson-Honeywell in October 2017 dismissed Bernard’s claim that his right to “life liberty security of the person and enjoyment of the property and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law” and to freedom of movement was infringed by the corporation.

Bernard subsequently appealed. Instead of going through with the appeal the court suggested mediation between the parties.",,,

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands. Despite a slight decrease in net income from $291 million in Q1 2023 to $272 million in Q1 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc demonstrated a 6.5% increase in total revenues reaching $1471 million. Operating profit surged by 17.3% and the operating profit margin under GAAP improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDAre also saw an 8.8% increase indicating a solid operational performance. The company's strategic divestitures of its interests in European and Asian joint ventures along with other U.S. properties reflect a focused approach to optimizing its portfolio.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management.

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

_______________

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4 percent on the property’s 2024 estimated results. Other terms were not disclosed.

The property is expected to be among Host’s top-25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with expected combined RevPAR of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $585502 further improving the quality of the company’s portfolio.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting. Among other amenities the property has a Bamford Wellness spa with six treatment rooms two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space including a 9400 square foot ballroom and 9300 square feet of pre-function space.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame."

HPQ,HP Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZmxvcmlkYXBob2VuaXguY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjkvaGFja2VkLWl0LWZlbHQtbGlrZS13ZS13ZXJlLWluLXBhc3N3b3JkLWhlbGwtYW1vbmctb3RoZXItdHJvdWJsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hacked: It felt like we were in Password Hell among other troubles • Florida Phoenix,"Hacked.

I write as a warning to those who use the internet – and hope it helps some of you avoid the trouble we’ve had over the past two months.

I was recently trying to make an HP printer work. It was almost new but refusing to print anything after I put in a new ink cartridge.

So I put the name and model of the printer into a Google search seeking the cure.

A website that appeared to belong to HP popped up and the chat box asked about my problem. When I responded the chat box offered an HP technician to help me on the phone.

The man who called said his name was Daniel and his ID number was HP8852.

He said he needed to check the computer I was using to see if he could diagnose the problem. He said he was checking my security and claimed he found a Trojan virus and evidence that someone had been accessing my computer.

Hackers he suggested. He displayed the words “Trojan virus’’ on the screen and an indication that someone had accessed our system.

He offered to secure the system for me but said it would cost me $795 to get lifetime protection for all of my computers so no one would ever be able to access them.

At this point I still thought I was dealing with an HP agent. What could possibly go wrong?

Then he started insisting that I write a check and show it to him and send it by overnight mail. He wanted $795 to secure our computers for life.

By this time I realized there was a lot that was wrong about this deal but I had let him in the door and was trying to figure the best way out.

The second our call ended I googled up the words HP and Scam and found an undated post apparently made by HP. It warned of fraud and urged people to protect themselves from scammers who might try to convince you that your computer required immediate technical support and request payment while trying to trick you into installing “malicious software viruses or spyware” that could jeopardize the security of your personal information passwords and user names.

The warning included a note that HP would never contact customers to provide unsolicited technical support but said some scammers were pretending to work for HP and had even changed their caller ID information to make it appear the calls had come from HP.

It urged anyone who had been contacted by one of the scammers to change all passwords run a security scan and report the information to authorities.

I immediately disconnected our internet modem and removed the internet connection for all of our devices including iPhones and started trying to contact CenturyLink the telephone company that provided our home service. It took me five days to reach a human being — and that happened only after I posted a complaint on Twitter. The company’s Twitter team contacted me.

But CenturyLink did furnish us with a better modem and better service despite the fact that COVID keeps technicians away from your house. They simply mail you the equipment overnight with instructions for installing it. Fortunately a tech savvy friend helped us set it up.

By then the Best Buy Geek Squad had cleaned our computers and promised to send techs to our house to review all electronics and internet access.

My husband and I had immediately discovered that the hackers had installed some sort of spyware and could access anything we connected to the old internet system. That left us unable to use our computers for a couple of weeks while we awaited a home visit from the Geek Squad.

We are not computer experts and pay an annual fee for help from the group. The Squad sent a very competent expert to check our system the printers and everything that could be infected.

I immediately reported the contacts to the FBI’s internet crime complaint center and the Federal Trade Commission after finding their complaint forms online. I also called HP to complain and they quickly sent an apology and took a report on our situation.

I did not pay the hackers any money and stopped payment on the check I had written even though I had not mailed it.

We spent weeks changing and re-changing passwords establishing fraud alerts on all accounts and verifying and re-verifying our identity with each account. It felt like we were in Password Hell. Every account wanted additional verification that it was really one of us accessing it.

Meanwhile we were checking and re-checking accounts to be sure our bank account did not disappear and no one else could charge anything to our credit cards and accounts.

I cannot count the hours of sleep we lost or the number of times we called our bank’s automatic line to verify that our account was okay.

It has taken us almost two months to replace some account cards create new passwords and accounts and make sure our computers and home internet services are secure. Even my Facebook account had been locked because someone was trying to make changes to it.

Grocery delivery company Ocado has revealed that it’s now using 3D printing technology to build the pick-and-pack robots found at its fulfillment centers.

Speaking at the Ocado Re:Imagined virtual event earlier this week Ocado CEO and founder Tim Steiner unveiled the company’s new 600 Series fulfillment robot which is set to replace the current 500 Series. The latest design is both lighter and more cost-effective to manufacture than its predecessors thanks to half of its parts being 3D printed via HP’s MultiJet Fusion (MJF) technology.

Ocado believes that its new approach to robot production will result in significant packaging efficiency improvements all while slashing day-to-day operating costs.

Steiner said “Because the 600 Series bots are highly energy-efficient and require a lot less power to achieve the same throughput from the same footprint new sites will require less chill equipment lowering energy consumption levels and overall construction costs.”

The Ocado Orbit model

Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic Ocado’s business has been booming with online grocery deliveries seeing massive growth over the past two years. According to Steiner this has meant that the firm’s fulfillment centers have been working overtime to maintain rapid deliveries.

To keep up with demand Ocado has developed what it refers to as the “world’s first virtual distribution center”. The smart platform eliminates the need for an entire network of regional distribution centers creating a system where smaller fulfilment warehouses share the one virtual center instead. Each of the robot-equipped warehouses holds a small portion of the platform’s stock but they all have access to the entire product range meaning customers far and wide can order any item they want.

Leveraging machine learning capabilities Ocada Orbit moves groceries from center to center to ensure there’s enough supply to meet the demand at any given location.

The new 600 Series bot

The efficiency of Ocado’s deliveries can largely be attributed to the firm’s hardware innovations. The new 600 Series was designed using topology optimization techniques making it light but strong and well-suited to additive manufacturing. According to the firm the latest model is five times lighter than its predecessor and is expected to go live within fulfillment centers in the coming months. Due to the robot’s modularity the company will also be able to 3D print replacement parts on-demand at its warehouses.

Since the 600 Series is so portable it gives Ocado the opportunity to build ultra-light grids for the bots to traverse across. These new grids can be built in weeks rather than months and can be installed in a wider range of buildings.

Steiner adds “The dramatic reduction in material used for our lighter grids not only makes site design easier but it also allows us to install our new technology into simpler buildings significantly reducing the timelines and costs associated with the construction of purpose-built facilities.”

As Ocado no doubt understands robotics can be a great application of additive manufacturing. Recently researchers at ETH Zurich used 3D printing to build an autonomous cat-like robot that’s capable of imitating the movements of real-life felines. 3D printed using SLS FDM and MJF over nine months the ‘Dyana’ bot features impact resistant thigh pads which allow it to run freely.

Elsewhere XRobots’ James Bruton a robotics engineer and 3D printing YouTuber recently showcased V3 of his 3D printed robotic dog. Dubbed openDog the open-source project has been running for a couple of years now and is intended as a more accessible cost-effective alternative to Boston Dynamics’ Spot (which retails at ~$75000).

Dr Mike Lynch who sold the software company to Hewlett Packard (HP) for $11bn in 2011 is wanted to face trial in the US on allegations he artificially inflated Autonomy's value before the sale resulting in ""colossal"" losses for HP.

The billionaire businessman has consistently denied the claims.

His legal team told a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court that the decision on his extradition should wait until judgment in a separate civil case brought by HP against him and Autonomy's former finance chief Sushovan Hussain.

A draft version is expected in September.

But District Judge Michael Snow told Dr Lynch: ""I have rejected your various challenges under the Extradition Act.

""I am required to send the case to the secretary of state on whether you should be extradited to the US.""

The ruling means that the Home Secretary Priti Patel has a final say on whether to allow the move.

If she approves the decision Dr Lynch has 14 days to launch an appeal.

His lawyer Chris Morvillo said of the ruling: ""Dr Lynch is disappointed that the court has ruled against him without waiting for the High Court's judgment in the civil case that examined all these issues.

""Dr Lynch denies the charges against him. At the request of the US Department of Justice (DoJ) the court has ruled that a British citizen who ran a British company listed on the London Stock Exchange should be extradited to America over allegations about his conduct in the UK.

""We say this case belongs in the UK. If the Home Secretary nonetheless decides to order extradition Dr Lynch intends to appeal.""

At an earlier hearing the DoJ said of its extradition request: ""(Lynch) may be a UK citizen he may have long UK links but once he aimed his dishonest activities at the USA on such a monumental scale he cannot expect - just as any other English CEO could not expect - to be immune from the American justice system.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFib3V0Y2hyb21lYm9va3MuY29tL25ld3MvY2hyb21lYm9vay13b250LXByaW50LXRvLWFuLWhwLXByaW50ZXItd2l0aC1jaHJvbWUtb3MtOTcteW91cmUtbm90LWFsb25lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chromebook won't print to an HP printer with Chrome OS 97? You're not alone (updated),"Likely related to a recent software Chrome OS 97 update users are reporting that their Chromebook won’t print to an HP printer. Earlier this week the bug was considered a low priority. However it’s now a higher priority for Google to fix as more people say their Chromebook won’t print.

Chrome OS 97 and HP printer devices appear to be the commonalities in these reports. Initially the problem was reported by Chromebook owners for devices with either Intel or ARM-based processors. A fix was pushed out that has helped those with Intel Chromebooks. However the issue is still around for ARM-based Chromebooks. These are the Lenovo Duet 5 Chromebook HP Chromebook x2 11 and others that run on MediaTek and Qualcomm chips.

Yesterday a comment was made indicating something definitely changed in regards to HP printers with the Chrome OS 97 software update:

I’ve been able to reproduce this on M97. So far it looks like the problem is limited to ARM-based Chromebooks. We did an upgrade of hplip in M97 so my initial suspicion is that there’s a problem with the ARM build of the new version that made it through testing.

You’ll know if your device has this problem not only because you can’t get something printed but by a “Filter failed” message in the print queue message.

Earlier this week on Twitter a reader mentioned that his Chromebook can’t print and asked me to amplify the message by calling public attention to it. I decided not to mainly because a bug report was already filed and open for it. I also wanted to watch the process of submitting a bug to Google happen in “real-time”. At that time the priority was listed as a level 3.

@KevinCTofel dont suppose you could give this some visibility. Multiple reports n the chrome os and hp community forums. Seems a bug report is in but only p3. No obvious mention of it in the Chromebook media. https://t.co/QTzlgYAHaj — Paul (@Bandageboyz) January 26 2022

With more people reporting the issue to the bug report that priority is now a level 1 just shy of the highest priority which is a level 0. That actually makes sense to me as a level 0 would likely impact all Chromebook users. This is a subset of users with an HP printer. It’s important to them of course. But overall it’s still a small segment.

If you’re part of the affected user group and your Chromebook won’t print know that Google has escalated the issue. You can “star” the bug to follow the progress as well. And there is a reported workaround in the meantime if you can’t wait for the fix.

Update: Google has found the root cause of the problem and coded a fix.

YOUNGSTOWN Ohio – Coleman Health Services will be able to better serve the homeless population in the Mahoning Valley thanks to a $15000 donation Friday from Huntington Bank.

“Coleman is grateful for the support of Huntington Bank as the need for these services has greatly increased due to the pandemic” said Stacia Erdos Coleman regional development executive. “Most of the clients we serve at the Youngstown location have annual incomes of less than $16000 and 40% have incomes of less than $8000 annually.”

Health care including treatment for mental illness is often low on the list of priorities when homeless Erdos noted. The grant will provide those individuals and families living with mental illness access to safe affordable housing prevent evictions leading to homelessness maintain utilities and supply basic furnishings.

“We understand with poverty comes social problems including homelessness substance abuse and stress-involved medical and mental health problems” said William C. Shivers regional president for Huntington’s Canton and Mahoning Valley regions. Helping our neighbors has always been an important commitment within Huntington’s philanthropic and community investment strategies and is guided by our purpose of looking out for people. People do not choose to be in need – but we can choose to help.”

Coleman a nonprofit organization serves nearly 2000 clients at 611 Belmont Ave. which also serves as a walk-in clinic. Across the Mahoning Valley it serves 7000 people not only with counseling and case management but also assistance in removing the barriers to recovery by helping to secure social security cards employment and affordable housing.

In what's being called the biggest economic development project in Ohio's history local state and federal leaders from President Joe Biden to Gov. Mike DeWine welcomed the company's investment to build two semiconductor plants on land in New Albany.

""This is a major win for Ohio"" DeWine said last week. ""It's really a game-changer for our economic future.""

The state disclosed the incentives it will provide to the Silicon Valley-based chip company likely will top $1 billion.

Investment return is jobs direct and indirect

In return Ohio will get 3000 jobs paying an average of $135000 per year. There also will be 7000 construction jobs and thousands of additional indirect jobs in the region.

""We don't see jobs like that very often"" said Jodie Perry president and CEO of Richland Area Chamber & Economic Development.

She explained how the project will benefit Richland County.

""Attracting an economic development project like this will have ripple effects"" Perry said. ""Suppliers and others that want to work with that company want to have facilities nearby. That's something we would want to position ourselves for.""

Richland County could attract supply businesses

Perry said Richland County has places where businesses could build including the greenfield sites near Mansfield Lahm Regional Airport and Ontario Commerce Park.

Investments Intel and other chip companies are making are meant to stem the global chip supply shortage that has left car lots empty and consumers struggling to buy appliances and other goods.

The new factories will enhance American resilience against disruptions in the global supply chain and inflation an issue that the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened.

Marilyn John state representative for Ohio's District 2 said the Intel plant will be big for Ohio.

""I was proud to support HB 110 the state operating budget which included the 'Mega Projects' program to help increase Ohio's competitiveness in trying to attract large economic development proposals to Ohio such as Intel"" she said. ""This Intel project will create 3000 jobs directly and provide up to $100 billion over potentially four phases to build the world's largest chip-manufacturing plant in our state.

""An additional 20000 jobs will be created in construction indirect and support jobs. Thank you to all who worked diligently to bring this opportunity to the State of Ohio.""

Tim Bowersock Mansfield's economic development director said he's not sure what effect the Intel plant will have on city residents.

""It's right on the edge of where people will want to commute"" he said.

Bowersock said studies have shown the numbers of people commuting to a job from Mansfield and the numbers coming here to work are ""pretty close.""

The plants will establish America in the global market as a massive producer of semiconductor chips which help power many digital and electronic devices and will elevate the nation’s status as a manufacturing power.

""It's good for Ohio"" Bowersock noted. ""People don't think of Ohio when it comes to that type of profession.""

Like Perry Bowersock said there are businesses in Mansfield that could be on the supply chain for a plant such as Intel.

""We do have some folks who are invested in electronics and circuit boards"" he said.

Intel will look for workers from wide area

Bowersock added there is a long way to go before the jobs will be available.

""It sounds like it will be three years before they turn the switch on"" he said. ""A lot will come out in the next 12-18 months on how to apply if you're interested.

""They're going to draw from a pretty wide area. They're not looking at only Newark to fill that work force. That's just my opinion. They're going to need a lot of higher-end people that are IT-oriented or engineering-oriented.""

Because of that officials at North Central State College and the Ohio State University-Mansfield are more than a little excited.

Jack Hershey president of the Ohio Association of Community Colleges recognized the governor and JobsOhio for helping bring Intel to the state.

""By every measure this is an historic moment for our state a game-changing success that will bring lasting benefits to every corner of Ohio"" he said in a prepared statement. ""The job opportunities generated by Intel and by other high-tech industries sure to follow will require a strong and sustainable pipeline of skilled workers ready and able to seize those opportunities.

""Preparing that work force will be an ongoing challenge requiring the very best coordinated efforts from every level of education in our state"" Hershey said. ""Ohio’s 23 community colleges are well-prepared for that challenge and eager to collaborate to help Intel and other industries of the future thrive here by developing the talent they need to succeed.”

NC State OSU-Mansfield welcome opportunities for students

Dorey Diab president of NC State sees opportunity for area business and students.

“We’re committed to working with these new businesses and the state of Ohio as an education partner to develop relevant coursework and training programs beyond the ones we already have in these high-tech areas to meet the unique needs of this new semiconductor industry segment in Ohio"" he said in a prepared statement. ""The ripples of opportunity to hire our talented graduates from this exciting development will extend throughout the state.

""The residents and businesses of north central Ohio just one hour north of the new Intel facility are in a prime location for employment living conditions and technical support.”

Diab pointed to offerings at the local college.

“NC State continues to meet the changing needs of employers throughout the region. These efforts have led to the development of new majors in cyber security bioscience plastics manufacturing communication tower technician training and the bachelor of applied science in mechanical engineering technology. Our goal is to add microchip semiconductor manufacturing support to this list"" Diab said.

Norman Jones dean of OSU-M also welcomed the opportunities Intel will bring.

Local students will have training to fill jobs

""The Ohio State University at Mansfield recognizes the importance of strong partnerships between higher education government and business and industry in our region and now we see this success at the state level"" Jones said in a prepared statement. ""This is indeed exciting for Ohio as a top magnet for a new generation of talent. The investment by Intel will also bring so many more economic development opportunities in the long-term as the ecosystem enlarges.""

Jones said OSU-M students will have the training to fill the job openings.

""Launched in 2020 and offered on the regional campuses of Ohio State the bachelor of science in engineering technology major is designed to prepare current and future students for these new careers"" he said. ""Coursework includes both mechanical and electrical engineering components as well as a focus on leadership and the latest technology in automation and networking.

""Students understand process engineering and can integrate between production supply chain and logistics. The curriculum can be tailored to meet the needs for industry related to microchip production and it was designed to prepare Ohio’s workforce to be nimble in manufacturing leadership for the future.""

Jones also noted the branch campus' collaboration with North Central State College.

""We have begun working to expand offerings in cybersecurity and IT and we have a wonderful partnership with North Central State College to ensure a rich spectrum of opportunities in higher education for the region"" he said. ""Ohio State-Mansfield is already seen as a destination campus for students from many parts of the state and this can only flourish and be strengthened with the announcement by Intel.""

Gov. Mike DeWine and Lt. Gov. Jon Husted have made clear their unbridled delight at the unquestionably big news that Intel plans to spend $20 billion to build a semiconductor chip-manufacturing campus here in central Ohio.

This windfall they say will create 3000 jobs at Intel alone that the company promises will pay an average salary of $135000. The governor predicts that the project will add about $2.8 billion to Ohio's annual gross state product and rocket the state to the front of the American technology manufacturing pack.

All that sounds wonderful truly. One question for the governor and lieutenant governor: How much did it cost us taxpayers to land this sweetheart of a deal?

For a while they wouldn't say.

Thomas Suddes: Ohio voters will decide true value of $2 billion in incentives heading to Intel

Joe Blundo: Move over Silicon Valley and make way for 'Microhio' or 'Chip-opolis'

On Friday it became a little clearer why the pair weren't in a hurry to talk about that part. Lydia Mihalik director of the state's Department of Development revealed that the incentives will top $2 billion.

Closer to home Kid No. 2 is driving. DeWine and Husted run Ohio but my children run my household. I'm imagining my daughter now in high school adopting the same philosophy they did on this Intel deal except for a matter of greater importance to her.

""Dad! Great news! Katelynn bought a car!""

""Wow she did? Tell me about it.""

""It was an amazing deal"" she says. ""Her dad is a mechanic and he checked it out and said so. The car is in perfect shape and it really was a steal.

""This is great for you too"" she tells me. ""Now you won't have to cart me around everywhere. No more running me to dance or picking me up after Key Club. I can catch rides with Katelynn. I won't be taking your car anymore at the exact moment when you need it.""

If you have ever raised a teenager you recognize that this is indeed a selling point on par with Ohio landing the world's largest computer chip factory. By the time a child reaches driving age a parent on average has shuttled that kid about the distance to the moon and back during which the child will have spoken an average of three words to the parent.

""That sounds like an absolute win-win for her family and I suppose for us as well"" I say. My eyes glaze over as I imagine all those cold winter days to come when I won't have to kick off my slippers leave my fireside recliner and drag myself behind the steering wheel to chauffeur her and Katelynn on another thrifting excursion.

""So what did it cost her?""

""The car? Two thousand dollars.""

""She had that much saved up?"" I am surprised but impressed. Good for you Katelynn.

""Well no I gave her some from you and mom.""

""Excuse me? Why would do you that?""

""I already told you this will directly benefit both of you.""

""And how much of our money did you give Katelynn to attain this benefit?""

""I don't feel the need to tell you that at this time.""

""You used our money to help buy Katelynn a car and don't intend to tell us how much you took?""

""My decision to spend it as I've pointed out will bring you both great dividends down the road. You have my word and Katelynn's word on that.""

""And that is wonderful news should it come to pass"" I say. ""But we are talking about two different things.""

""But it's money you already had contributed for family use in the vacation fund jar. And the loose change jar too. So I saved you the hassle of cashing that all in and in some sense we're just talking about nickel-and-dime stuff. She also borrowed a few quarts of oil you had in the garage.""

""Borrowed?""

""You will get a return on your investment"" she says. ""I can promise you that for every six cents of capital investment you have made Katelynn has made a $1 investment.""

""Well I would hope so given it's her car.""

""Nevertheless it is a car that will benefit us all"" my daughter says. ""Just keep that in mind. Plus she got me something else for helping her. Check it out! It's this really nice plaque.""

@Theodore_Decker",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtub3hwYWdlcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8zMC93aGF0LWRvZXMtaW50ZWxzLWRlY2lzaW9uLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWluLWxpY2tpbmctY291bnR5LW1lYW4tZm9yLWtub3gtY291bnR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What does Intel's decision to build in Licking County mean for Knox County?,"MOUNT VERNON — Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced the state’s largest economic development project to-date on Jan. 21 in Newark.

From the stage of the historic Midland Theatre DeWine and other state officials celebrated the news that Intel a California-based semiconductor chip manufacturing company would be building two plants in Licking County in the coming years.

The company said it would invest $20 billion in the project – with the potential for up to eight factories and $100 billion over the next decade – creating an estimated 20000 jobs (both direct and indirect) in the process.

Construction is expected to start this year with the first chips being produced by 2025.

“It’s a special day a great day in Ohio history. …” DeWine said last Friday from the Midland stage smiling as applause rained down and the nation watched. Intel the world’s largest chip manufacturer by revenue had chosen Ohio over 39 other states after eight months of negotiations.

“This is a major win for Ohio” he continued “and it’s really a game-changer for our economic future.”

Sitting inside the recently opened BrewDog brewery in downtown New Albany roughly 20 miles away Knox County’s top economic development official looked on.

He had just learned of the project three days prior and was now watching the historic announcement alongside other local economic leaders from the central Ohio region. Their room was one of several from across the state to be featured on-screen at Midland near the beginning of the ceremony.

Questions raced through his mind. The moment was equal parts exciting and unsettling with so many variables unknown.

But he felt certain about one thing.

“This is gonna be great for the Columbus region” Jeff Gottke president of the Area Development Foundation said in an interview Monday. “Transformational I would say.”

Intel is planning to build its “mini-city” in western Licking County on land that will eventually be annexed into New Albany. It won’t be far from Knox County – just 12 miles south of Centerburg and 21 miles south of Mount Vernon.

When the project became official late last week local residents predictably had questions.

What does this mean for Knox County a historically rural community that was already beginning to see growth from Columbus? How might daily life change here over the next decade?

We spoke with county city village and township officials this week in an effort to find out.

‘We will see growth’

Intel’s decision to move to central Ohio could impact Knox County in several ways local officials said.

Population growth is almost inevitable Gottke said particularly in southern and central Knox County. The average work commute in the U.S. is 30 minutes he noted and the southern half of Knox County – including Mount Vernon – would fit within that radius.

“We will see some growth” Gottke said.

How much growth will occur? That will depend on several factors local officials said including the amount of housing available (Knox County is currently experiencing a housing shortage) and whether or not local municipalities will encourage development (through incentives zoning and other proactive measures that would make the community attractive to developers).

It will also depend on the sheer numbers of jobs this project creates.

Intel has said it will employ 3000 people at its Licking County site and the project itself will create 7000 construction jobs. The number of “indirect” jobs this project will create however is less certain. Estimates range between 10000 and 20000 according to local and state officials.

Gottke and other local officials believe Knox County could benefit from this “indirect” or residual growth.

Suppliers will be looking to relocate nearby he explained and Knox County could serve as a prime location. Several local officials floated Cooper Progress Park the 47-acre industrial campus in downtown Mount Vernon as a potential destination.

Knox County could also house businesses that benefit from Intel’s services. These are companies that don’t make supplies for semiconductor chips but do make things that rely on them – which is quite the list. Nearly every piece of modern technology from cars to cell phones relies on the product Intel will be making in western Licking County.

“Intel is expected to attract many partners and suppliers needed to support their operations” Knox County Commissioner Teresa Bemiller said. “(The) Area Development Foundation works closely with state partners including JobsOhio. It would be great to attract one or more of these companies to locate in Knox County.”

This ripple effect may extend beyond suppliers and partners however local officials said. Gottke said Intel’s decision could boost all areas of Knox County’s economy – even those entirely unrelated to the production or distribution of semiconductor chips.

“We’ll probably see … increased commercial opportunities in general. More retail more restaurants that kind of thing. …” Gottke said. “There’s no question that we’re gonna see development because of this Intel decision.”

Knox County’s tourism industry will also likely benefit from Intel’s decision local officials said.

As central Ohio expands even those who don’t end up living here will be looking for recreational opportunities – places to explore and things to do – and local officials believe Knox County will be well-positioned to offer those kinds of experiences (and reap the economic benefits of doing so).

“I believe this will bring more visitors to the area who will be in search of entertainment and leisure activities which will benefit Mount Vernon and Knox County” Mount Vernon Mayor Matt Starr said.

When Honda chose to build its $4 billion auto plant in Marysville in 1982 the rest of central Ohio prospered. Knox County became home to two Honda suppliers – Sanoh America Inc. in Mount Vernon and FT Precision in Fredericktown – despite being located more than an hour away from the facility.

Gottke said Intel’s project – a $20 billion investment the biggest in Ohio’s history – will be Honda “times two.”

“They estimate that for every dollar they invest there will be $100 more of follow-on investment by other entities” Gottke said. “So this is really important and really big for the region.”

Bemiller who has served as a Knox County commissioner since 2008 called Intel’s decision generational.

“For the state and central Ohio in particular the economic impact of this decision should be felt for years. It is hard to quantify it at this point” she said. “The number of good-paying jobs that will be generated including construction and support jobs will be major for the entire region.”

‘A plethora of opportunities’

Intel’s decision to build in Licking County also presents an opportunity for the local educational system.

Knox County’s K-12 school districts career center and higher-education institutions may look to add programs that would prepare students for a future in the semiconductor industry.

Intel has already announced that it will invest $100 million in an industry-specific education program over the next decade helping create a pipeline between Ohio’s educational institutions and the Licking County facility.

“We will be in close proximity to the Intel facility. This would provide employment opportunities for Knox County residents particularly students” Bemiller said.

“Intel has indicated they want to work with the state’s colleges and universities to develop semiconductor-specific courses for associate and undergraduate degree programs.”

Intel said it plans to offer a wide range of jobs – ranging from technician roles that require a two-year degree to engineers and researchers with PhDs – which will pay an average of $135000 per year.

While Gottke said many of the software engineering and research jobs will likely be imported at first given the nuance of this industry in Ohio occupations of all kinds will eventually become available as the company builds out.

“Everything from associate degrees up to the highest-end PhD degrees” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a recent interview. “We need the full range of capabilities.”

Leaders at Knox County’s higher-education institutions said this week they were excited about Intel’s announcement and looking forward to this new opportunity.

Central Ohio Technical College with two branch locations in Licking County and one in Mount Vernon figures to benefit from Intel’s accessibility and interest. But leaders from Mount Vernon Nazarene University and Kenyon College are also looking forward to participating in the pipeline.

Samantha Scoles MVNU’s coordinator of communications and public relations said the university already has programs that would prepare students for a career there and is planning to add more.

“Students from our computer science and engineering programs will be well qualified for internship positions and graduates from those programs will undoubtedly benefit from the abundance of jobs that will be created by development of the new ‘silicon heartland'” Scoles said.

“The timing of the announcement could not be better as we are planning to add a computer engineering concentration to our engineering major. We look forward to exploring a partnership with Intel through their Ohio Semiconductor Center for Innovation initiative.”

Tracy Corrigan Kenyon’s director of employer relations noted that “it is incredibly early in this process” but said the college is “very eager to see the landscape and how it begins to unfold.”

“I have no doubt that there’s going to be a plethora of opportunities for all students” Corrigan said.

Leaders within Knox County’s K-12 districts also see an opportunity here. Kathy Greenich superintendent of the Knox County Career Center said Monday her administration was already working to learn more about how it could prepare students for Ohio’s technological future.

“We are looking for information on exactly what skill sets Intel will be looking for in employees” she said.

This Gottke said offers a window into the potential magnitude of Intel’s decision. Preparing Knox County for Intel’s arrival will be a multi-generational effort involving nearly every sector of community life.

“It trickles down to the public schools too. I mean what kind of curricular additions can they have (to meet the need)? Do they have a computer science program?” Gottke said.

“When I say ‘transformational’ that’s the kind of stuff that’s gonna be impacted.”

‘Huge for our country’

Much about Intel’s decision to build in western Licking County remains uncertain.

What specific kinds of jobs will be offered and how many and when? What will need to happen from an infrastructural standpoint to make this possible in central Ohio? How might federal legislation impact Intel’s project – the speed at which the company builds and hires and the scope of the company’s total investment when all is said and done?

Local officials – everyone from school superintendents to mayors – are asking these questions. The answers whenever they might come and whatever they might be will impact Knox County’s future.

In the meantime however people like Gottke are focused on the certainties. And one of those certainties he said is that Intel’s decision won’t just impact Knox County and central Ohio. It will impact the world.

The move will help re-establish the U.S. as a major manufacturer of semiconductor chips a vital piece of technology in today’s society. The U.S. has long depended on foreign production of these chips Gottke said and Intel’s decision to build in Ohio will change that.

President Joe Biden recently touted the investment as a major win for the U.S. economy and for national security given the military’s reliance on semiconductor technology.

“To be able to say ‘Made in Ohio. Made in America.’ What we used to always be able to say 25 30 years ago. That’s what this is about” Biden said during a press briefing Jan. 21 just hours after the news of Intel’s decision broke.

“We’re going to stamp everything we can ‘Made in America’ especially these computer chips.”

Federal and state officials have said this move – bringing chip manufacturing back to the U.S. – will help shore up supply-chain issues that have been felt in recent months. This has local officials excited as it could very well impact the daily lives of residents in Knox County.

“It is widely known that the shortage of chips is slowing down production of many items from our police cruisers to the materials we need for crosswalks” said Amber Keener an at-large member of Mount Vernon City Council.

The city currently has several new police cruisers waiting out-of-state for chips to be installed Starr noted and stateside production could help prevent those kinds of issues moving forward.

“This major investment in manufacturing (chips) here is huge for our country” Bemiller said.

But for now Gottke and others are focused on preparing Knox County for the future. And that means Intel’s arrival.

Gottke said that in the days since the Jan. 21 announcement he’s been working nonstop to get Knox County ready. He’s been taking phone calls from local officials and setting up meetings.

“My to-do list basically just got blown up right now because of this Intel thing” he said with a laugh.

Knox County will have a say in what happens here over the next decade-plus Gottke said as a result of Intel’s historic investment. But he believes the planning must begin now.

“This is a little bit tough for us because we don’t want to jump the gun and guess on something that doesn’t end up happening. But then we also don’t want to wait too long and let that growth be dictated to us” Gottke said.

“So we’ve got some time to think about who needs to be at the table and what needs to be done before we actually pull the trigger on anything. That’s gonna be key is being prepared before we take any action.”

In the days ahead we’ll examine how Knox County is preparing for Intel’s arrival – what officials at the county city village and township levels are thinking and doing to brace for impact.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdhcmthZHZvY2F0ZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAxLzMwL2xhbmQtcnVzaC1ob3VzaW5nLWhhcy1qb2huc3Rvd24tc2NyYW1ibGluZy1hZnRlci1pbnRlbC1hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQtb2hpby1saWNraW5nLWNvdW55LzkyNTg1NjIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Land rush has Johnstown scrambling after Intel announcement,"No commitment required.

""I do think that we’re losing too many agents"" Ortiz said. ""As an organization we gotta start taking care of each other.""

Ortiz acknowledged agents’ frustration with Mayorkas in the room.

""I get it"" Ortiz said. ""You come to work you’re frustrated. You’re upset because you didn’t get the desired outcome that you want. Doesn’t mean you give up.""

""We’re not"" one agent responded.

""I know you’re not"" Ortiz replied. ""That’s why I’m saying we don’t give up. We stay focused we continue to do the job and the mission that we signed up for. We all signed up for it we all raised our hand.""

That’s when things got more heated.

""It’s kinda hard to say that when…"" one agent began to say.

""It’s not hard to say it"" Ortiz shot back. ""It may be hard for you to say it I’ve been doing this for 31 years. It’s not hard for me to say it.""

Other agents chimed in that ""you keep releasing criminal aliens into the country.""

""You’re getting bogged down in the policies and the politics"" Ortiz stressed.

Multiple agents then said agents can’t use the term ""illegal aliens.""

""You just said it"" Ortiz replied. ""Ain’t nothing gonna happen to you.""

""That’s the problem chief"" one agent interjected. ""For evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. That’s exactly what’s happening here. Good men are doing nothing. You’re allowing illegal aliens to be dropped off in communities.""

Ortiz insisted that agents are doing good work by rescuing people and taking fentanyl and methamphetamine off the streets.

""And under this administration in the last year we’ve got the highest fentanyl deaths in the history of our country"" one person in the room shot back.

Ortiz said the U.S. has caught more fentanyl coming across the border this year than last year but one agent wondered how much is not being caught.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

We pull into the parking lot of the giant Domtar Corp. facility at Ashdown and I breathe in that familiar paper mill smell.

It's familiar because I was raised in south Arkansas. When I played high school football at Arkadelphia in the 1970s several conference opponents (Camden Camden Fairview Crossett and Ashdown) were in paper mill towns. We joked that it served as a home-field advantage for those teams since their players breathed the fumes on a daily basis and were more accustomed to the smell.

I'm with Max Braswell who heads the Arkansas Forestry Association and once worked at this mill.

Ashdown 19 miles north of Texarkana in the southwest corner of the state was a timber town long before Nekoosa built the mill in 1968. The mill was sold to Georgia-Pacific in 1991 and to Domtar in 2001. Domtar is based at Fort Mill S.C.

Ashdown was first known as Turkey Flats then Keller and finally Ashdown when it was incorporated in June 1892.

""It was named by Judge Lawrence Alexander Byrne who owned sawmills in the area and who reportedly stated after a fire at his Keller mill that though the mill had 'burned down to ashes' he was going to found a town there"" Martha Trusley writes for the Central Arkansas Library System's Encyclopedia of Arkansas. ""The town began to develop quickly with the coming of the railroad. In 1895 the Arkansas & Choctaw Railroad from Ashdown to Arkinda in Little River County was built.""

Later the railroad that would become Kansas City Southern led to additional growth. Crews cleared virgin forests in the area and shipped logs out by rail. Development of Millwood Lake in the early 1960s by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gave boosters of a paper mill the confidence that there would always be enough water for such industrial prospects.

Ashdown is a prime example of how closely the economic fate of south Arkansas is tied to that of the timber industry.

Domtar sources logs from a 120-mile radius and more than 500 trucks a day find their way to the mill. The company has longtime relationships with growers in Arkansas Texas Louisiana and Oklahoma in order to ensure a steady supply of fiber.

Domtar employees work directly with 55 landowners who own almost 72000 acres of timber to ensure they provide what's known as certified fiber.

Doug Teale who has worked at the Ashdown mill for more than two decades is group manager for Four States Timberland Owners Association. The association has about 265 members who control 632000 acres of timber.

""The world is going green and our customers want green sustainable products"" Teale says. ""The owners association helps us ensure that we're doing the right things. Our people who work out in the woods and our logging contractors understand the importance of certification. The standards are stringent and are re-evaluated every four or five years. Third-party auditors see to it that we're doing it correctly.""

Last May it was announced that Domtar was being acquired by Paper Excellence a global manufacturer of pulp and specialty printing writing and packaging papers. The announcement said Domtar would continue to operate as a stand-alone business entity. Domtar stockholders approved the deal in July.

Good news for Arkansas came that same month when it was announced that Domtar would restart a paper machine at Ashdown in 2022 adding 185000 tons of capacity to its operations. The restart cost the company $10 million.

""As the economy begins to recover from the pandemic the demand for paper is also recovering"" Rob Melton a Domtar senior vice president said at the time. ""Our customers' business is steadily growing and we want to support that growth.""

Allan Bohn general manager of the Ashdown mill came to Arkansas from North Carolina three years ago. He's an industry veteran who is used to responding to changing markets.

""There were four paper machines here including one of the largest in North America"" he says. ""We initially reduced paper production in response to a growing market for pulp. When we shut a paper machine down we added a pulp drier. More than 70 percent of the pulp is shipped out of New Orleans and Houston to China. On the paper side we're the market leader for office papers.""

Bohn thinks the Ashdown mill has a bright future.

""This is a really good operation"" he says. ""It's perfectly positioned in the middle of a huge wood basin. This facility was built to take on big projects and I can promise you that there are big projects in our future. We're able to pivot rapidly in Ashdown because of the quality of the people we have working here. We have multigenerational employees whose families have been involved with this mill since it opened in 1968. We're going to be around here for a long time.""

The best thing south Arkansas has going for it is the amount of timber being grown.

""Net timber growth continues to exceed harvests by more than 18 million tons annually which will keep fiber resource costs low for the near future"" Nana Tian and Matthew Pelkki write for the Arkansas Center for Forest Business at the University of Arkansas at Monticello. ""Expansion and interest in the forest resources of the state remain strong.""

Hundreds of timber industry jobs were shed during the Great Recession earlier in this century in south Arkansas towns such as Crossett and Warren. Those jobs never came back.

If south Arkansas is to achieve its economic potential new jobs in the wood products sector will have to be created during the next decade.

The region continues to trail most of the state in job growth. The three largest metropolitan areas in Arkansas--northwest Arkansas central Arkansas and the Fort Smith metro--accounted for 80 percent of the state's 49366 year-over-year job gains in November. Northwest Arkansas alone contributed 44.1 percent of those gains.

Unemployment rates were just 1.5 percent in northwest Arkansas 1.7 percent in the Jonesboro metro 2.1 percent in the Fort Smith metro and 2.3 percent in central Arkansas.

Though down considerably from the previous year unemployment rates were higher in south Arkansas: 2.8 percent in the Hot Springs metro 3.5 percent in the Pine Bluff metro and 4.2 percent in the Texarkana metro.

As south Arkansas tries to add jobs in the timber industry it can look to its past for inspiration. A century ago the region was among the nation's leaders in innovation.

""In 1900 timber processing was fairly straightforward"" George Balogh writes in a history of the industry. ""Contractors or company employees extended company logging railroads into the woods as needed selected a tree trimmed its branches cut it down rough-sawed it into manageable log sections and skidded it out of the woods to the railhead using mule teams. They would then load logs onto company railroad cars.

""Once logs made it to the sawmill they were sorted by size cut into boards planed dried and seasoned before being shipped to lumber markets by rail. By the mid-1920s owners of huge timber acreages in south Arkansas such as the Crossett-Watzek-Gates group and International Paper began to notice a new phenomenon. Timberlands cleared at the turn of the century had usable forests.""

Southern forests were growing back far more quickly than forests in the Great Lakes region where a number of the timber barons in south Arkansas previously had worked.

""U.S. pioneers in scientific forest management had established the first college-level forestry schools in the 1890s and 1900s"" Balogh writes. ""Gifford Pinchot a Yale University graduate trained in forestry at the French Forest School. On his return to the United States Pinchot began experimenting with continuous forest growth at the Biltmore Estate in Asheville N.C. in 1892. He then further refined this process known as sustained yield forestry.

""In 1898 Cornell University offered a degree program in scientific forestry and Pinchot was instrumental in launching a master's degree program in practical forestry at the Yale School of Forestry in 1900. Professionals from those programs began to view the pine forests as a crop and to communicate their message to forest owners across the South.""

Cap Gates manager of the Crossett Lumber Co. contacted Yale professor H.H. Chapman in 1926. Gates wanted to learn about sustainable forestry. Chapman who had been conducting camps in northern Louisiana for Yale forestry students told Gates to hire a professional forester.

""Gates hired W.K. Williams and began a tradition of professional forest management at Crossett"" Balogh writes. ""Arkansas visionaries such as L.K. Pomeroy E.P. Connor A.W. 'Wack' Wackerman and R.R. Reynolds joined national forestry figures in spreading the message of sustainability across the country. The management techniques used in Arkansas are still being applied to U.S. forests.

""Technical specialists and owners of Arkansas timberlands grappled with problems such as reducing waste using smaller trees and producing diversified products. A long string of useful developments occurred between 1926 and 1980 to accomplish these objectives. Collectively these improvements are known as process orientation because they incorporated technology-based processes to add value to basic forest products.""

International Paper opened a kraft paper mill--used for cardboard boxes and heavy-duty wrapping paper--at Camden in 1928. By 1968 the mill employed 2100 people and turned out more than 500 tons of paper a day. IP closed the Camden mill in January 2001. The city's population has steadily declined since that time.

In a story for The Associated Press shortly after the closure Melissa Nelson wrote: ""For 73 years the stacks at International Paper Co.'s mill belched gray sour steam day and night over the pine woods of south Arkansas. On summer afternoons the plumes sullied laundry hanging outside. On winter mornings they guided deer hunters downwind of their quarry. In any season townspeople knew the answer to the question 'paper or plastic?'

""But IP closed the paper-bag plant in January leaving 580 workers without a way to support families long dependent on company paychecks. The employee union urged IP to sell to another papermaker but the company refused to put it into a competitor's hands while the market is down.""

By 1960 in Crossett there was a kraft paper mill a food board plant that made milk cartons and frozen-food packaging materials and a flake board plant that made sheets of plywood-like boards. There also was a company that produced commercially useful chemicals from wood waste.

In 1963 Crossett Lumber Co. successor Georgia-Pacific opened a first-of-its-kind plywood plant in Fordyce. Layoffs would later hit Crossett and Fordyce hard. In September 2011 for example Georgia-Pacific announced the layoff of 700 workers in Crossett.

""The layoff of 36 employees of the Arkansas Forestry Commission in late 2011 added to the image of a depressed industry"" Balogh writes. ""In time recovery of the housing market improved the outlook of the wood products industry. It's uncertain whether that industry will return to its former prominent position as a producer of housing materials shift to other ways of marketing the natural timber resources or assume a smaller role in the state's economy. The impact on the people and communities that rely on the industry also remains uncertain.""

At a time when the economy is hitting on all cylinders in much of Arkansas that uncertainty persists in the pine forests of the Gulf Coastal Plain.

The station is scheduled to be complete by the end of 2022.

China's next five years in space may be even busier than the previous five.

On Friday (Jan. 28) the nation released a white paper outlining its plans and priorities for the next half-decade of spaceflight and exploration. China has achieved a great deal in the final frontier recently from returning moon samples to Earth to starting the assembly of a space station  and the document makes clear that the country plans to build on those successes.

""In the next five years China will integrate space science technology and applications while pursuing the new development philosophy building a new development model and meeting the requirements for high-quality development"" states the white paper  which is called ""China's Space Program: A 2021 Perspective.""

""It will start a new journey towards [becoming] a space power"" the document's authors write. ""The space industry will contribute more to China's growth as a whole to global consensus and common effort with regard to outer space exploration and utilization and to human progress.""

China launched 207 space missions from 2016 to December 2021 the white paper notes. That's an impressive tally but the nation is not content with its current stable of launch vehicles.

""In the next five years China will continue to improve the capacity and performance of its space transport system and move faster to upgrade launch vehicles"" the document states. ""It will further expand the launch vehicle family send into space new-generation manned carrier rockets and high-thrust solid-fuel carrier rockets and speed up the R&D [research and development] of heavy-lift launch vehicles.""

China launched Tianhe the core module of its new space station in April 2021 and sent two three-astronaut missions to the orbiting lab shortly thereafter one in June and the other in October. The country plans to finish building the station this year a task that will entail the launch of two other modules known as Mengtian and Wentian.

In addition China is building a space telescope called Xuntian which will launch to the same orbit as the space station and dock with it periodically.

Xuntian will launch within the next five years the new document states. And the space station will get quite a workout during that stretch; astronauts will live there on ""long-term assignments"" conducting a variety of research and maintenance activities.

China also aims to put boots on the moon in the relatively near future a bold goal that will get serious attention over the next five years. Over the next half-decade China will ""continue studies and research on the plan for a human lunar landing develop new-generation manned spacecraft and research key technologies to lay a foundation for exploring and developing cislunar space"" the white paper states.

In January 2019 China's robotic Chang'e 4 mission became the first ever to ace a soft landing on the moon's far side. In December 2020 Chang'e 5 brought pristine lunar samples back to the Earth the first time that had been done since the 1970s. And in February 2021 China's first fully homegrown interplanetary mission Tianwen 1  slipped into orbit around Mars. In May of that year a rover called Zhurong separated from the Tianwen 1 orbiter and landed successfully on the Red Planet.

China intends to notch more robotic exploration successes over the next five years. According to the white paper over this stretch the nation will launch the Chang'e 6 sample-return mission to a lunar polar region; launch Chang'e 7 ""to perform a precise landing in the moon's polar regions and a hopping detection [of water ice presumably] in lunar shadowed area;"" and finish research and development on important technologies for Chang'e 8 which is designed to help lay the foundation for a lunar research outpost . ( Chang'e 6 and Chang'e 7 are both targeted for the mid-2020s and Chang'e 7 will likely lift off first.)

China will also launch a mission (called ZhengHe ) that will both return samples from an asteroid and study a comet up close according to the document. And there's more.

Over the next five years the nation will also ""complete key technological research on Mars sampling and return exploration of the Jupiter system and so forth"" as well as ""study plans for boundary exploration of the solar system"" the white paper states.

""Boundary exploration"" is an apparent reference to a mission that would send twin probes to the edge of the heliosphere — the huge bubble of charged particles that the sun blows around itself — and beyond into interstellar space. China aims to launch that mission in the mid-2020s according to SpaceNews .

""China's Space Program: A 2021 Perspective"" is the fifth five-year space exploration plan that China has published following similar releases in 2000 2006 2011 and 2016. You can read the new document in English here .",,,,,,,,,

When Craig Rogers’ patients wake up after life-saving surgery to remove cancer cells in their prostate glands they are left with a single 3cm scar. By the end of the same day many of them have been discharged and returned home. But Rogers who has been operating on prostate cancer patients at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit for more than a decade does not take complete credit for their speedy recovery.

It “would not be possible” Rogers says without the help of his trusty assistant: a $2m robot.

In the two decades since becoming commercially available 6700 Da Vinci surgical machines — the newest version of which operates through only a single incision — have been installed in hospitals worldwide. And more than 10m procedures have been performed using the technology.

Robotic-assisted surgery differs from conventional keyhole surgery otherwise known as laparoscopy as surgeons operate on patients using one or several robotic arms directed from a control panel.

Intuitive Surgical the company behind the Da Vinci system had dominated the field. But the surgical robotics market which is now worth $6bn is being enlivened by fresh competition as Intuitive’s core patents on the technology expire. By 2028 the market is projected to more than triple in value to around $22bn according to Verified Market Research a data company.

However scepticism around the technology remains — with some experts warning that uptake of robotic surgery has outpaced evidence of its benefits for patients and cost-conscious healthcare systems.

Rogers sees it differently though. He compares the trend towards robotic surgery to the use of painting robots in the car industry with which his hometown is synonymous. “I’m from Detroit where they use robots to paint cars: if you need to get to a hard to reach area you don’t do it with a person a robot does it” he explains. He likens conventional keyhole surgery to “building a ship in a bottle with chopsticks”.

So far the US has embraced surgical robotics more than any other country accounting for around half of the global market. Across the country the vast majority of prostate bladder and kidney surgeries are carried out using robots and in the state of Michigan 15 per cent of all surgical procedures involve a robotics according to a study published in JAMA Network Open.

By contrast in western Europe robotic-assisted surgery accounts for just 2 per cent of the total procedures performed each year according to estimates from medical technology company Medtronic.

Richard Sullivan director of the institute of cancer policy at King’s College London says the rush towards robotic surgery which the US has spearheaded has been driven in part by “technophilia”.

He says patients often think robotic-assisted surgery “self-evidently must be better” because the technology “looks sexier” adding that US surgeons who are hesitant about surgical robots are increasingly regarded as “luddites”.

“In the US it’s a fully competitive system . . . [if] you don’t have a robot your patients don’t come to you” says Sullivan. “You can see why a patient would think if the incisions on my stomach are small rather than a whopping great six-inch scar surely it must be doing less damage. But that’s not what counts. What counts is what we do inside.”

Advocates of surgical robotics argue that the difference is not just cosmetic though. Michael Stifelman director of robotic surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center in New York who works with Intuitive says the technology offers a “culmination of subtler benefits that really add up”.

For his patients he says robot-assisted surgery has shortened their wait to be discharged reduced complications after surgery and sped up recovery times.

The technology has also made minimally invasive surgery more accessible to a greater number of surgeons than conventional keyhole surgery. In addition it has extended surgeons’ careers as it is less demanding on their bodies according to Stifelman. He estimates that the freedom to perform surgery while seated will extend his career by a decade.

“We’re not just doing it to say we do it we always make sure we’re doing it for the right reasons” he says.

England’s NHS has pinned its hopes on robotic surgery to help its workforce tackle a post-pandemic backlog of 6m patients waiting for non-urgent procedures.

As the Covid-19 caseload in hospitals eased last summer Stephen Powis NHS England national medical director said the technology had “propelled us much further along in our Covid recovery than would have been possible before” adding that it would “play an increasingly pivotal role” in reducing patient wait times for surgery.

But in spite the faith placed in the technology there “is not a huge amount” of “hardcore evidence” for its cost-effectiveness says Christopher Peters a consultant upper gastrointestinal surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare Trust in London. Hence the slow uptake by England’s thrifty NHS — it had only 61 surgical robots in use across the country in autumn 2020 although it has more added since.

A study found robotic surgery cases stayed in hospital for 3.3 days on average less than half the stay of open surgery patients while the cost per day in hospital was 1.7 times higher

Nor are the benefits clear-cut. An analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine last year found that the results from 50 studies looking at a combined total of nearly 5000 robotic surgery patients showed “no difference” between robotic-assisted techniques and laparoscopy or open surgery in the likelihood of complications or long-term outcomes.

In fact the researchers found that gynaecological robotic surgery took up to 265 minutes or 13 per cent longer than the most time-intensive laparoscopy and 41 per cent longer than the equivalent open surgery.

Separately a study by researchers at the University of California San Diego found that robotic surgery cases stayed in hospital for 3.3 days on average less than half the stay of open surgery patients but slightly longer than patients who received conventional keyhole surgery. The cost per day in hospital was also 1.7 times higher for robotic surgery patients.

Nevertheless Peters predicts that robotic-assisted surgery will “become the default” in European countries over the next decade as “robots become so ubiquitous and such good value for money that the bar you have to cross to justify using it will be much lower.” He says: “Hospital bosses will just ask: why not?”

Peters also believes the technology will become more affordable and widely available as Intuitive’s “stranglehold” over the surgical robotics market “loosened”. The company enjoys a market share in excess of 80 per cent but time is running out on many of the 20-year patents it registered around the time of its US launch in 2000. This will free up space for competitors.

Medtronic Johnson & Johnson and UK-based CMR Surgical are among the leading companies now vying for a share of the growing market and — in the process — making the technology more affordable.

Terry Chang director of strategy at surgical robotics manufacturer Medicaroid which gained regulatory approval in its home country of Japan last year believes Intuitive was “trying to build [a] moat around the business” by renewing patents. However he says he is “starting to see a lot more companies being creative and getting into the market”.

Per Vergard Nerseth

Per Vergard Nerseth chief executive of CMR Surgical says he is “confident” his company can outcompete Intuitive on CMR’s “home turf” of Europe where surgical robotics is still “fairly nascent”. “Our robot has a very unique wrist” says Nerseth. “It’s why we’re able to make our robots so much smaller than any other brand which gives us a really unique offering.”

However experts stressed that improving access to the best surgical care in richer nations and developing countries will depend far more on resolving the scarcity of surgeons who take more than a decade to train. Even in the well-resourced US staff shortages across the main surgical specialities could reach 30200 by 2034 according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.

Surgical robotics is therefore “not a panacea it’s merely a plaster over labour force issues” says Roger Kneebone professor of surgical education at Imperial College London. “On their own these robots are just an impressive piece of kit they don’t improve things without highly skilled surgeons to operate them — and there’s not enough of those.”

Despite the scepticism surgical robotics continues to extend its reach into new specialisms and territories. In recent months surgical robots have removed eye tumours and inserted cochlear implants for the first time.

“Where the US goes the world tends to follow” says Jelle Ruurda an upper gastrointestinal surgeon at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. He compares the change to the uptake of CAT and MRI scanners.

“Twenty years ago there was one CAT scanner in every hospital in Europe and in the US there were hospitals that already had 10” Ruurda points out. “Now every self-respecting hospital has at least 10 CAT scanners and a couple of MRI scanners. I think it will be the same for robotics.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

On the occasion of the World Day for Consecrated Life 2 February the Vatican Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life has addressed a letter to the world’s consecrated men and women.

By Vatican News staff reporter

Pope Francis will mark the World Day for Consecrated Life on Wednesday with a Eucharistic celebration in Rome’s St. Peter's Basilica.

Pope Saint John Paul II instituted the annual observance of the Catholic Church marking it for the first time in 1997. He designated its celebration on February 2 the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord.

For the 26th edition of the celebration this year the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life has addressed a letter to the world’s consecrated men and women inviting them to walk together as a community in the synodal spirit of participation where members exercise responsibility for one another through mutual listening excluding no one.

The joy of ‘we’

The Prefect of the Congregation Cardinal Joao Braz de Aviz and Secretary Archbishop Jose Rogriguez Carballo who signed the letter explain that this year’s message focuses on ‘participation” the second word of the theme of the 2023 Synod: Communion Participation and Mission.

Recalling the exhortation of Pope Francis the message says “no one no one should be excluded or feel excluded from this journey; no one no one should think ‘it doesn't concern me’.”

The message recalls that by going back to their vocational call consecrated persons will rediscover the enthusiasm amazement and joy of feeling and being part of a project of love for which others like them have also made their lives available for the good of humanity. The Vatican Congregation thus invites consecrated persons to revive this memory warning that “over time it risks losing its strength especially when we replace the attractiveness of ‘we’ with the strength of ‘I’”.

Participation of all

The first proof of participation is belonging the message says adding “I cannot participate if I conceive of myself as the whole and do not recognize myself as part of a shared project.” Hence the importance of asking ourselves what this listening in the community consists of: “Who are the brothers and sisters we listen to and before that why do we listen to them?”

“We cannot call ourselves a vocational community and even less a community of life if the participation of some or others is missing.”

The Congregation invites consecrated men and women to the synodal journey of participation “strong in the conviction that we can only receive and give Good” because as Pope Francis says consecrated life is born grows and can give evangelical fruits only in the Church the living communion of the faithful People of God.

Responsibility

Participation thus becomes responsibility whereby “we cannot but be among others and with others”. And even before that synodality begins within us from a ""change of mentality from a personal conversion in the community or fraternity in our homes workplaces and structures structures to expand into ministries and mission"".

Thus nourishing the synodal journey together that begins with listening means making room for the other in our lives taking seriously what is important to him or her.

Participation also means co-responsibility especially in the missionary dream of reaching out to all of caring for all of feeling that we are all brothers and sisters together in life and in history which is the history of salvation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Laydon | News Sports Jobs - The Daily News,"IRON MOUNTAIN — James R. Laydon 64 passed away at home on Wednesday Jan. 26 2022 with his wife at his side.

Jim was born on Aug. 7 1957 in Iron Mountain the son of Gordon and Delores (Rubbo) Laydon. He graduated from Iron Mountain High School in 1975 and married his high school sweetheart Mel (Applin) Laydon in 1977.

Jim attended Lake Superior College graduating in 1979 with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering technology. He furthered his education earning his master of business administration from California Polytechnic University.

Jim founded his own company Laydon Technology Inc. and worked out of his home for many years as a design engineer. He was currently employed at Trident Maritime Systems LLC as director of Production Services.

Jim served on the Iron Mountain School Board for four years and was a founding member of the first IMHS Academic Booster Club. He helped initiate the F.I.R.S.T. Club an investment club 25 years ago. Jim enjoyed his monthly meetings and in spite of themselves the group was able to eke out a small gain over the years. His co-members have said they will not only miss his role in the spirited and lively discussions during their meetings but also his lead in the many adventures that occurred after.

Jim was an avid supporter of the soccer programs coaching at the high school level but more intensively for the Niagara Northern Stars Soccer Club for over 15 years serving as the current president since 2018. He was passionate to pass the love and knowledge of the game onto so many over the years and gave of his time freely to assist anyone who wanted to improve their skills. He spent countless hours on the road supporting his grandson and the game he loved. He also was a huge Manchester United fan rooting them on in every match.

Above all Jim was first and foremost a family man. His wife children and grandchildren meant the world to him. He attended all sporting events and he thrived on intense competition with Gavyn in a game of Casino and challenged Ryken in every board game possible. He passed along his love of camp and nature onto his whole family with a tremendous amount of time spent by a campfire and enjoying family meals and cookouts. He enjoyed traveling to see his daughter Ashlie as often as he could. He crossed many people’s path in life whether it was work-related or doing what he enjoyed but he had a lasting impact on them with his kindness generosity and good-hearted nature.

Jim is survived by his loving wife of 44 years Mel Laydon of Iron Mountain; his son Adam (Danielle) Laydon of Iron Mountain; his daughter Ashlie Laydon (Garren Andrews) of Bingen Wash.; his grandsons Gavyn and Ryken Laydon; and his brother John Laydon of Spread Eagle.

Jim was preceded in death by his parents Delores and Gordon Laydon.

In lieu of flowers a donation can be made to a cause near and dear to Jim’s heart – The Niagara Northern Stars Soccer Club P.O. Box 303 Niagara WI 54151.

Visitation will be held 10 a.m. to noon on Tuesday Feb. 1 at the Erickson-Rochon & Nash Funeral Home in Iron Mountain.

Services will follow at noon at the funeral home. Rev. Kevin Sullivan will officiate. Burial will be in Iron Mountain Cemetery Park.

He’s also a generous guy with a great sense of humor. It’s helped him deal with some misinformed reactions to his latest business venture.

“I always turn everything into humor” he said. “Let’s just say I have been laughing a lot.”

He commented to the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal 24 hours after announcing Athlete Advocate Consortium (AAC) on Wednesday (Jan. 26). Hunt is the son of Johnelle Hunt and the late J.B. Hunt founders of Lowell-based J.B. Hunt Transport Services. He and his wife Mandy formed the new organization to guide college athletes in the new era that allows them to make money from their name image and likeness (NIL) while remaining eligible to compete.

AAC will connect nonprofits with college athletes who are now allowed varying degrees of new protections and opportunities to make money by selling their NIL rights. The NCAA announced the rule change on July 1 2021.

JD Notae a senior on the University of Arkansas basketball team is AAC’s first signee. Hunt said the company would use Notae’s NIL to benefit the Samaritan Community Center (SCC) a food pantry and soup kitchen in Northwest Arkansas and a longtime recipient of the Hunts’ philanthropy.

Bryan Hunt is a wealthy UA alumnus (class of 1983) and he and Mandy are ardent Razorback supporters. They have the means to financially support certain players as they see fit — legally — through NIL.

But considering the new money era remains a complex issue on the college sports landscape and the idea of paying amateur athletes still takes getting used to it was not surprising that Razorback sports fans didn’t correctly grasp AAC’s business model.

In some corners of social media overzealous Razorback fans hailed the news as J.B. Hunt Transport starting a company to pay UA athletes — current or potential. It’s not.

One report referred to Bryan and Mandy Hunt as J.B. Hunt executives. They are not. Bryan Hunt is a J.B. Hunt board member and the managing member of several private companies including Hunt Automotive LLC.

“Don’t get me wrong we’re very close to J.B. Hunt Transport and that’s near to our heart and I enjoy serving on the board” he said. “But this is strictly a Bryan and Mandy Hunt opportunity that we felt like there was a need for.”

AAC is also not a nonprofit group. According to the Arkansas Secretary of State’s office Bryan Hunt filed paperwork to create the Athlete Advocate Consortium LLC in October 2021.

“Under advisement from several legal entities we decided to establish AAC as a limited liability company” he said. “It was important to us to assist not compete with various 501c3 organizations by being one ourselves.

“The creation of AAC is and never will be about personal financial or taxation gains for us. This is all about promoting and assisting community nonprofits through the usage of student-athletes as their advocates.”

Hunt didn’t disclose the investment to start AAC or the financial details of Notae’s contract. There will be more deals announced possibly even with non-Razorbacks.

In Notae’s case depending on time commitments he will raise awareness about SCC in several ways including work attending fundraisers or media appearances. The center is nearing the start of a $14 million capital campaign to build a new facility in Rogers.

Notae’s contract with AAC has a sunset clause meaning the Hunts have his NLI rights for a specific undisclosed period.

“If [Notae] chooses to go past that we’ll make that decision together” Hunt said.

A UNIQUE ARRANGEMENT

Bryan Hunt grew up in Northwest Arkansas. As a longtime Razorback supporter he’s cultivated friendships with several UA coaches and administrators and personally gotten to know many players. He said he always found it awkward to see college students who could use some help but he couldn’t legally assist them because they played sports no matter how trivial.

“I saw an athlete walking down the sidewalk one day and I was getting ready to pull over and give them a ride” he recalled. “One of the athletics administrators was in the car with me and he said ‘No you can’t do that. You can’t give him a ride to campus.’ Of course by nature I was going to do it anyway. And he said ‘No. You’re not.’ And he was very serious. So I didn’t.”

Less than a year after one of the most significant rule changes in the history of college sports like it or not NCAA athletes at the highest level (Division I) are in line not just for car rides but for large bank accounts.

According to USA Today at the University of Texas one group is dangling $50000 a year for individual offensive linemen while another says it already has $10 million promised for Longhorns athletes. At the University of Oregon billionaire Nike founder Phil Knight is part of a group helping Ducks athletes line up deals. Knight is just one of many interested parties with deep pockets jumping in alongside the apparel companies energy drink companies car dealerships and restaurants already signing athletes to endorsement deals.

Several Razorback athletes have announced deals with numerous companies paying them for their NIL rights. Notae has a NIL deal with a Fayetteville restaurant and Hunt said AAC contracts don’t require exclusivity.

The fledgling industry’s actual size is unknown due to the lack of a public clearinghouse that tracks NIL compensation and activity.

Most schools have hesitated to release details provided by their athletes citing privacy concerns. However UA athletics director Hunter Yurachek tweeted on Jan. 7 that 159 Razorback athletes had earned nearly $1 million in NIL compensation through 385 agreements since July 1.

AAC’s arrangement is unique because the focus is not on monetizing college athletes and the companies that engage them.

Josh Lens is an assistant professor of recreation and sport management at the University of Arkansas and consults for universities and conferences regarding legal and NCAA matters. He said AAC’s facilitation of pairing athletes to charities or nonprofit groups is an example of what he considers “peak NIL.”

He referenced two University of Iowa football players using their NIL to raise significant funds for a local children’s hospital and an organization that seeks to prevent stillbirth.

“While other perhaps flashier NIL arrangements across the country may receive national headlines due to the involvement of brand new cars or large compensation amounts NCAA enforcement staff scrutiny may accompany those headlines if universities use NIL as a recruiting inducement or if the arrangement constitutes pay-for-play or an impermissible extra benefit under NCAA rules” Lens said.

Terry Prentice is the UA’s senior associate athletic director for athlete brand development and inclusive excellence. The university hired him in March 2021 specifically to help the athletics department stay on top of policies and NIL-related compliance issues.

He said that with the NIL space being so new the UA had encouraged local businesses Razorback donors and fans as a whole to ask questions and understand parameters before acting.

“Bryan and Mandy did exactly that” he said. “They came to us in the early fall looking for some perspective and asking questions about NIL. They shared that they intended to support student-athletes and the community as a whole while doing so compliantly. After several conversations they felt confident enough to develop the [business] framework for AAC including disclosing necessary agreements with our student-athletes to the UA.”

Prentice said colleagues from around the country had shared positive feedback about AAC with him and others on the UA brand development team including Yurachek and deputy athletics director Jon Fagg. They’ve shared that reaction with the Hunt family.

“Through seven months we’ve seen quite a bit of what I will call traditional — or what we thought was traditional a year ago — version of NIL including radio ads TV commercials and in-store appearances” Prentice said. “However what stands out to our peers is the comprehensive approach in financially supporting the student-athlete building their professional network and then helping connect to a local cause the student-athlete is passionate about.”

Chris Wyrick an AAC spokesman said he fielded nearly 50 inquiries about the company in six hours after the Hunts announced the endeavor Wednesday. They ranged from athletes agents college administrators and startup companies working in the NIL space.

JD AND J.B.

Mandy Hunt is passionate about Razorback basketball and rarely misses a game sitting courtside at Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville.

“I love the kids” she said. “And I’m not afraid to meet them reach out to them or congratulate them after the game with a big hug. That’s how I met JD.”

A Georgia native Notae is in his second season in Fayetteville after transferring from Jacksonville (Fla.) University. He’s one of the top players in the Southeastern Conference averaging nearly 19 points per game.

Notae had a hardscrabble life as a boy. Raised by a single mother he sometimes didn’t know where he would sleep or where his next meal would come from.

Mandy Hunt knew pieces of his background but wanted to dig deeper.

“There is more to that player than just that jersey and what they do on that court” she said.

As the Hunts got to know more about Notae and Bryan Hunt dug deeper into NIL involvement the initial idea of a business model started to crystalize. On Oct. 6 through a friend the Hunts invited Notae to their east Springdale residence to share their proposal.

“You could not put two better [sides] together than JD Notae and the Samaritan Community Center” Bryan Hunt said. “Put it this way — we’re not that smart. There was a higher purpose that brought this together. It was just phenomenal to listen to him talk about what he wants to do with his life and his goals and objectives.”

Hunt said learning more intimately about Notae’s youth reminded him of his father. A sharecropper’s son J.B. Hunt was born in 1927 and grew up poor in north central Arkansas during the Great Depression. He quit school at 12 to help support his family.

“He’s had a really hard life” Hunt said of Notae. “And you’d never know it from talking to him or spending time with him. You’d think the guy lives next to the Queen of England because of his attitude and outlook on life. He reminded me so much of talking to my dad. JD’s not one to talk much about it.”

Hunt said a handful of AAC deals will be announced this spring but did not disclose the nonprofits or athletes involved.

He responded to naysayers who say AAC comes across more to pay athletes instead of achieving a charitable objective.

“Either you think it’s genuine or you don’t” he said. “Don’t get me wrong. Some people are going to abuse NIL and take advantage of the athletes. We’re already seeing that from the athletes we’re talking to about this.

“We’re not going to pay somebody to support an organization. That’s not what we do. What we do is put athletes and organizations together. Now the athlete does need to be compensated. But it’s got to be the right athlete and it’s got to be about community service. It can’t be about NIL. NIL needs to be the bridge that allows us to work with an athlete to do this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2phbi8zMC9hLXF1YXJ0ZXItb2YtbndhcmthbnNhcy1jb3ZpZC0xOS1jYXNlcy1hbW9uZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A quarter of Arkansas' covid-19 cases among kids; doctor says most illnesses mild but severe sickness possible,"Omicron is affecting a higher proportion of people under the age of 18 in Arkansas than previous variants did although most cases are mild according to local experts.

On Thursday there were 20443 active pediatric covid-19 cases in the state representing 25.6% of the 79868 total active cases according to the Arkansas Department of Health. In comparison only 21.6% of the total cases since the beginning of the pandemic have been among the 0-18 age group.

Kids under 18 account for 23.2% of the state’s population according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

In the 19-county region the Department of Health designates as Northwest Arkansas there were 902 active pediatric cases Thursday.

Omicron is more contagious than previous variants and is always looking for the next susceptible person said Dr. Marti Sharkey Fayetteville public health officer and practicing pediatrician.

Unfortunately young children are disproportionately affected she said. They are the most susceptible hosts because children ages 5 to 11 have the lowest vaccination rate and children under 5 are not even eligible for vaccination she said.

A total of 10952 active cases in the state or about 13.7% were among kids under the age of 11 according to the Department of Health. The Census Bureau website does not list the percentage of population that falls in that age group.

Dr. Robert Williams chief medical officer for Arkansas Children’s Northwest said the hospital is seeing an increased positivity rate among kids being tested for the virus.

Children are generally not affected severely by the omicron variant but with the overwhelming number of patients who are testing positive for the virus it’s possible any one of them could have a severe case Williams said.

Many of the hospitalized covid-19 patients are coming into the hospital for other reasons such as appendicitis or a broken arm and are testing positive for the virus even though they don’t have symptoms Williams said.

“We are finding a bunch of people who wouldn’t have otherwise known they had covid” he said.

On Friday 28 children were hospitalized at Arkansas Children’s Hospital in Little Rock and seven were hospitalized at the hospital’s Northwest campus in Springdale for a total of 35 according to spokeswoman Nicole Huddleston. At the Little Rock hospital five children were in intensive care units and four were on a ventilator she said.

Arkansas Children’s Hospital on Jan. 19 had an all-time high of 46 patients hospitalized for covid-19 on both campuses combined Huddleston said.

A total of 1720 covid-19 patients were hospitalized with the virus in the state Thursday according to the Department of Health. The number of currently hospitalized children was not available according to spokeswoman Danyelle McNeill.

Since the pandemic began 1202 children have been hospitalized with the virus 152 have been admitted to ICU and four have died according to the Department of Health. Nationally 748 children have died of covid-19 according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Seeking care

Omicron symptoms in children include a cough runny nose congestion headache and fever Williams said. Most cases are mild but research shows that adolescents with other medical problems are at a much higher risk for having a severe infection Williams said. Although it’s rare otherwise healthy kids can get a severe case he said.

Parents should seek medical attention if their child is having trouble breathing not able to eat because they are throwing up or if fever reducers such as Tylenol or ibuprofen bring their temperature down but they still feel and look terrible Williams said.

The good news is omicron is not as severe an infection for the lower respiratory system as previous variants were Sharkey said. Instead it causes more upper respiratory symptoms she said.

Children under age 5 and those with asthma are most prone to respiratory problems Sharkey said. Since children have smaller upper respiratory systems than adults compared to their body size upper respiratory system inflammation causes more distress in kids Sharkey said. Children can get a croupy cough and during coughing spells oxygen levels can drop precipitously she said.

Parents should watch for prolonged coughing spells with any change in skin color from red to purple Sharkey said. Dehydration is another frequent problem in infants and young children because they have trouble drinking when they are congested she said.

It isn’t necessary for people who have been exposed to covid-19 or have mild symptoms to visit the emergency room or even make a doctor’s appointment to get a covid-19 test Williams said. People who have been exposed to covid-19 and have symptoms most likely have the virus and should quarantine at home he said.

Testing is available at local pharmacies and drive-through testing sites he said.

Vaccination

Since Feb. 1 78.5% of pediatric cases have been in unvaccinated people according to the Arkansas Department of Health. On Friday 10.3% of kids age 12 to 18 were partially vaccinated and 44.8% were fully vaccinated the department’s covid-19 dashboard states.

“If you have any opportunity to offer your children a vaccine that could potentially save their life why wouldn’t you?” Williams said.

Even though it’s easy to assume healthy children wouldn’t get severely ill if they got covid-19 they may be going to school with children who are at risk Sharkey said. It’s important to protect the most vulnerable in the community she said.

Many children can’t get vaccinated because they are under the age of 5 while others can’t get vaccinated because of an immune system issue Williams said. The best thing families can do to protect those individuals is create a vaccine bubble around them he said. Anyone eligible to receive a vaccine or booster should do so he said.

The CDC this month recommended the Pfizer booster shot for children ages 12 and up five months after their second dose. Moderately to severely immunocompromised 5- to 11-year-olds can receive an additional primary dose of the Pfizer vaccine 28 days after their second shot the CDC states.

The booster shot is the same vaccine that was given during the first two rounds so there should be no further side effects Williams said. He compared the booster to an immunity reminder.

“Just like when you are told the same thing three or four times you are more likely to remember it” he said.

Arkansas Children’s Hospital has not treated any patients with symptoms attributed to covid-19 vaccine side effects Williams said.

Both Sharkey and Williams encouraged parents with questions to talk to their doctor rather than relying on social media for answers.

Other measures for preventing the spread of the virus include social distancing washing hands frequently and wearing a mask — especially a medical-grade surgical mask Williams said.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

The second season of Euphoria HBO’s popular high-school drama has spent some time delving into the mind of one of the show’s adult — and most loathsome — characters: Eric Dane‘s Cal Jacobs.

Throughout the third and fourth episodes the latter of which aired Sunday night viewers of the Sam Levinson series come to understand how Cal’s past remains very much present. As Cal’s life continues to become more intertwined with that of his wayward son Nate (Jacob Elordi) Euphoria travels back in time to tell a queer love story.

Episode three “Ruminations: Big and Little Bullys” opens with Zendaya’s Rue narrating Cal’s high-school experience: “He spent every day with his best friend Derek.” Young Cal (Elias Kacavas) and Derek (Henry Eikenberry) were on the wrestling team and spent the majority of their time together. Cal is seen lusting after Derek — even after he meets a young Marsha (Rebecca Louise) who will eventually become his wife — but hides his feelings under the eye of his disapproving and strict father.

On graduation night Cal and Derek celebrate at a gay bar outside of town where they share a dance and their first kiss. Before Cal is able to soak in the joy of finally being with Derek however he wakes up to a call from Marsha who tells him she’s pregnant.

“There are causes and conditions to what made Cal Cal and I think watching episode three you get a lot of insight as to how he became who he became” Dane tells The Hollywood Reporter. “It doesn’t explain all of it. You know I think at a certain age we are responsible for taking care of our own shit and it’s incumbent upon us to do so. We’re no longer able to blame things on our parents.”

But the fact that Cal has been repressing his sexual identity doesn’t excuse the things he’s done Dane explains.

“You’re not going to walk away from this thinking ‘Oh Cal what a great guy. I get why he does the things he does and it’s excusable'” Dane says. “But there is some insight to give the viewer a better understanding. I don’t condone his behavior. I don’t advocate his behavior. But then again it’s not for me to judge.”

In Sunday’s episode Euphoria explores how Dane’s Cal is still dealing with the fallout of losing Derek and having to deny who he is in his adult life. When the pressure becomes too much for him he finally breaks down. He returns to the bar where he and Derek spent graduation night gets drunk and dances on the same floor with another man but imagines he’s Derek. “I thought I’d lost you” he says picturing his once-best friend.

After Cal and the man stop dancing the man asks him if he’s crying which he is and then Cal tries to wrestle with him like he used to do with Derek. When the bouncer tells him to leave the bar he tries to wrestle him too and is eventually kicked out. Cal heads home and cracks under the weight of it all.

He enters his house and begins maniacally laughing while urinating in the foyer and when Marsha (Paula Marshall) asks what’s wrong Cal — with his penis still out for the majority of the scene (“I can’t play this character with one foot in and one foot out so I have to totally commit to it” he tells THR) — deadpans and simply replies “I think I’m lonely.” This begins a seven-minute monologue in which Cal touches on everything from being forced to hide his emotions to son Nate being his biggest regret in life to all of the men he’s had sex with while married to Marsha.

“I have a problem” Cal tells Nate and his brother Aaron (Zak Steiner). “But the reason I have a problem is this family. I’m not allowed to form an emotional connection and I’m an emotional guy. You fuckers backed me into a corner but you know what? I think you set me free. So this is farewell.”

That was the most difficult scene of the season for Dane to shoot he says. Not only did it take “an inordinate amount of preparation” but he also wanted to be sure it was as impactful as it was meant to be.

“Cal tells Nate that he’s his biggest regret and at face value you might think that bringing Nate into the world is a regret. I don’t see it as that. I see it as ‘I failed with you. You’re my biggest regret because I failed'” Dane says unpacking how Nate and Cal’s relationship shows how trauma can be passed on through generations and in this scenario toxic masculinity. “I don’t know if Cal hates his son. He resents him but I think moreso he resents himself for continuing the cycle of handing down the terrible attributes that were handed down to me by my father.”

Over the first four episodes of season two viewers can see Cal begin to unravel in ways he never did during the first season. He was contained and controlled in season one Dane points out but becomes totally undone this time around. “Any opportunity that Cal gets where he can be a parent — vis-à-vis going to Fezco’s (Angus Cloud) and trying to stick up for his son because he got the crap beat out of him by him — is an opportunity he’s going to take” he says of what Cal is carrying around. “I think it alleviates some of the guilt he feels.”

“The bond we have off-camera facilitates in making the on-camera stuff a little bit more real” says Eric Dane of onscreen son Jacob Elordi. Courtesy of HBO

Heading into season two “I looked at [showrunner] Sam [Levinson] and I was like ‘Wow we get to create a whole new Cal’ because we’ve never seen this guy living his truth. Therefore we’ve never seen him” Dane says. “We gotta break him down before we could build him back up. And that’s what we’re seeing right now: the absolute dumpster fire of a meltdown that is Cal Jacobs.”

If Marsha hadn’t called that morning with the news that she was pregnant Dane believes he and Derek would have been together and Cal could have been a happy gay man comfortable in his own skin and not living a lie.

“I like to think that Derek went on to probably do something similar to what I did start a family. I don’t know if Derek was as gay as Cal was. I think Derek and Cal were just best friends who loved each other and who wanted to share everything together” he says.

As for what’s next for Nate and Cal Dane hopes his family can understand him a little more and accept him for who he is though it may be pretty difficult considering his parting words in episode four.

“I hope he gets the opportunity to be a good parent. His son needs it” Dane says. “His son really needs his father and I hope Cal gets an opportunity to be a father to his son to bury the hatchet so to speak.”

He then adds “Pretty difficult to do considering the burning hole he just left in the ground but I think Cal wants some understanding and some acceptance from his son.”

If it was Arturo Roman from Money Heist who was hated by the world in 2020 this year Nate Jacobs from Euphoria has been getting on people’s nerves.

Ever since Season 2 of Euphoria was aired earlier this month people have been wondering who can annihilate the toxic character in the American teen drama series. Despite getting beaten up black and blue in the very first episode of Season 2 Jacobs recovered quickly. It seems like the hyper-masculine high school jock always makes it through safely without facing serious consequences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phY29iLXNoaW5lci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjQ3MDQxNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob Shiner Obituary (2003 - 2022) - Ogden UT,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/jacob-shiner-obituary?id=32470414 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phY29iLXNoaW5lci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjQ3MDQxNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phY29iLWNyZWVjaC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjUzNjc1NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob Creech Obituary - Floyd Funeral Home - Olanta - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/jacob-creech-obituary?id=32536755 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phY29iLWNyZWVjaC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjUzNjc1NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

At the height of the disaster 32 roads were closed due to flooding and emergency crews responded to 17 high-water rescues. Unfortunately one of these rescues was for a little boy who was found dead hours after being swept away by floodwaters early Sunday morning.

Johnson County Emergency Management Director Jamie Moore described the situation as ""scary to be in fast water.""

""It's been a difficult time for Johnson County over the last several days"" said Moore.

Emergency crews from across the county worked tirelessly to rescue those trapped in the floodwaters including Moore himself who was caught in high water on the way to rescue the Warren family.

""I accelerated and came around the corner and ended up in high water and my vehicle was surrounded"" Moore said. He had to work on top of his truck. ""I ended up spending the next hour and a half on top of my truck.""

Across the city of Venus firefighters responded to another high water rescue on County Road 616. Firefighters said a woman who was eight months pregnant was trapped.

""We witnessed a car that was being swept off the bridge into flood waters"" said Venue Fire Department Engineer Zach Hagaman.

""By some miracle I don't know how she was able to grab ahold of a tree and she climbed up higher into the tree to escape the flood waters which was still inaccessible for us but it bought us a little more time.""

Hagaman said he tied a rope to his waist and tried to walk through the swift water to the woman but could not reach her. A swift water rescue crew from Red Oak was able to get her to safety.

As the county continues to deal with the aftermath of the severe storms and flooding residents are encouraged to stay informed and heed any warnings issued by local authorities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YWhvby5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9kd2F5bmUtam9obnNvbi1pcy1kaWZmaWN1bHQtdG8td29yay13aXRoLXJlcG9ydC1jbGFpbXMtdGhlLXN0YXItaGFzLW1vdW50YWlucy1vZi1wdWJsaWMtZ29vZHdpbGwtdG8tb2Zmc2V0LW5lZ2F0aXZpdHktZXhwZXJ0LXNheXMtMTcxNDAyNDM4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dwayne Johnson is difficult to work with report claims. The star has 'mountains of public goodwill' to offset negativity ...,"Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s nice guy reputation has been taking some hits — but the “mountains of public goodwill” he’s built over the years should outshine the drama an expert tells Yahoo Entertainment.

A recent report from the Wrap saw more than a dozen people who worked with Johnson on the upcoming holiday action-comedy film Red One criticize his “chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set.”

Insiders claimed the Black Adam actor — who co-stars alongside Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons — “was late an average of seven to eight hours per day and missed several entire days of production” resulting in the movie running at least $50 million over budget. They pointed fingers at the film’s “inexperienced” lead producer Hiram Garcia who is Johnson’s ex-brother-in-law and ex-personal assistant for letting things spiral. An insider called the situation “a f***ing disaster” and claimed “Dwayne truly doesn’t give a f***.”

Sources claimed Johnson’s lateness is a pattern saying he had a “huge fight” with an “infuriated” Ryan Reynolds after showing up five hours late to the set of their movie Red Notice in 2020. There’s also a wild story about him urinating in water bottles (something he previously copped to doing).

A spokesperson for Amazon MGM the film studio behind Red One denied the claims in the report calling Johnson and his production company Seven Bucks “incredible partners.” Johnson insiders told the outlet he “averaged no more than one hour late” and “the budget did not deviate much from the agreed-upon figure.” Johnson’s rep did not respond to Yahoo’s request for comment.

Despite the scathing report a crisis and PR expert doesn’t expect this to cause lasting damage to Johnson’s reputation.

“There is a better chance of Martians landing on the lawn of the Biden White House than this ever permanently hurting the Rock” Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants tells Yahoo.

What’s going on with Johnson?

In addition to being one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood Johnson is one of the most likable celebrities — and a large part of that is due to his strong work ethic. Johnson brands himself as a hard worker — his Instagram with 397 million followers shows a dizzying schedule of gym time movie shoots meetings adorable girl dad moments and philanthropy.

Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks is a nod to his bank account balance when he was cut from a pro football team at age 22. It made the then broke star pivot to a career in wrestling rising through the ranks at the World Wrestling Federation (later called World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) before crossing over to Hollywood and starring in the Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises. In 2016 Forbes listed Johnson as the highest-paid actor and currently estimates his net worth at $270 million between his movies production company wrestling endorsements and brands. A key part of his success is being able to connect with the masses but not forgetting his roots which is why many want to see him run for president.

It seems that over the last year-plus however there have been some negative headlines. The biggest prior to now was in September when he and Oprah Winfrey faced backlash after asking people to donate to their Maui wildfire fund — instead of giving more of their own money. He acknowledged the criticism and he and Winfrey quietly donated more than they had pledged.

The drama has been simmering elsewhere: His bankability took a small hit with 2022’s Black Adam which didn’t perform as well as anticipated and he faced criticism over how he handled it. The Wrap story also seemed to confirm that Johnson attempted to have his production company take over the DC films universe in 2022. It didn’t happen and Johnson going around others for the secret meeting didn’t sit well. Variety reported on that in 2023 with an insider saying Johnson’s “demands” — including having his brand of tequila served at a premiere of PG-13-rated Black Adam — “increased and the returns just weren’t there.”

This year Johnson made a big return to WWE and was appointed to the board of its parent company TKO but he was booed by fans for being almost two hours late to an April event. Recently he’s been hamming it up to play the villain in the pro wrestling storyline. The same week the View audience jeered the mention of his name for saying he won’t be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. (He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but said he learned that sharing his political opinions only causes division.)

The Wrap story has brought back into conversation Johnson’s infamous feud with his Fast and the Furious franchise co-star Vin Diesel. If Johnson really does show up eight hours late to set — or not at all — that could certainly fuel tension (though reports at the time also cited Diesel’s lateness). The article also surfaces drama with Reynolds noting that the co-stars “didn’t speak for years” after their fall 2020 blowup but have since patched things up.

There’s been counterprogramming to the Wrap story. An unconfirmed report from Puck suggests that “unflattering” press about Johnson may stem from a former publicist. People magazine ran a story about Johnson’s “flourishing career” and how he’s found “success in many areas” with an unnamed source saying “People love him.” And the Rock’s own Instagram feed has been filled with sweet fan encounters and charitable endeavors.

Years of building a good reputation will ‘offset these recent damaging allegations’

It’s true — people do love Johnson who has spent years cultivating a good reputation and it should help see him through this negative patch of press.

“The best strategy for the Rock is to tackle the bad press in a setting where he can poke fun at himself and the facts of his situation” says Schiffer. “The Rock is beloved globally and has built mountains of public goodwill that can offset these recent damaging allegations.”

How does a star like Johnson who will voice the Maui character in the Moana sequel out later this year break the cycle of bad press? By “addressing the negative items with empathy and truth owning your part in it and then showing what you learned” says Schiffer.

He adds “The Rock did that well with the outcry in Hawaii and will likely do the same with the hits on being late on the set of his film.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15ZXJzLW1vcnR1YXJ5LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyeS9LZW5uZXRoLUNvb3AtSm9obnNvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Kenneth Coop Johnson,"It is with profound sadness and immense love that we announce the passing of Kenneth Coop Johnson a compassionate and humble soul who touched countless lives with his generosity and empathy. Born on October 19 1932 Ken lived a fulfilling life that epitomized service hard work faith and love. As Mother Teresa once said ""Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love"" and this was the essence of Ken's life.

Ken was a proud native of Ogden Utah where he was born to Arthur Lorenzo Johnson and Dorothy Elizabeth Coop Johnson. His journey of life was marked by outstanding achievements and deep commitment to his faith and his community. He was an accomplished academic first graduating from Ogden High School where he made his mark on the football field. He furthered his education at Weber College University of Utah and finally the University of Minnesota where he earned a Master's Degree in Hospital Administration. Ken worked full-time at J.G. Read & Bros. in order to pay for his education and support his young family on his way to completion of his undergraduate degrees.

Ken's professional life was as accomplished as his academic journey. He served as an assistant administrator at three hospitals was the administrator of Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City Utah administrator of McKay-Dee hospital in Ogden Utah and eventually served as Vice President of Operations at Intermountain Healthcare retiring in 1992.

Ken's love story was one of devotion and eternal love. He was married to Kathryn Claire Armstrong on March 21 1952 and they were blessed with nine beautiful children never missing any of their school or social events and he coached little league teams for many years for all including his grandkids. After Claire's passing Ken found love again with Margene Pulsipher Taylor blending two large remarkable families and epitomizing the power of love and commitment.

His dedication to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was unwavering and he served in numerous capacities including Young Men’s President High Councilor Bishop’s Counselor Bishop Patriarch and Temple Sealer. Ken served a mission with Claire in the Germany Frankfurt mission and also served a mission with Margene in the Asia Area Office in Hong Kong where they served as Area Welfare Agents for LDS Charities which took them to ten other countries in Asia including China.

Ken was preceded in death by his parents his first wife Claire son Kerrigan Healy grandsons Luke Ian Kash and Major Brent (Jennie)Taylor granddaughters Ashley and Brittany brothers Arthur (Beverly) Jesse (Bunnie) Dave (Bonnie) and sisters Dorothy Hare (Don) and Carolynne Henderson (George).

After Dad's passing his grandson Mike said “there isn’t anyone on this earth that has a negative thing to say about Ken Johnson!” He was a true disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. He served others faithfully and untiringly in a humble and caring way. We will miss him greatly however as he taught us we are assured that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ we will be united again in a coming day. As dad would say ""the best is yet to come!""

It has been an interesting offseason for the Bengals... There were solid free-agency pickups and a good draft class but two trade requests since the end of last season.

One of those trade requests came from Tee Higgins after the Bengals placed the franchise tag on him.

There has been little to no progress since the trade request according to reports but Zac Taylor has made it clear he looks forward to seeing Higgins for the 2024 season.

Cincinnati Bengals legend Chad Ochocinco hit on the topic recently and says he has been in contact with Higgins “a few times.”

“I think we’re going to work it out. We’ll figure it out” Ochocinco said when asked about the contract issues between the two sides according to TMZ Sports.

Higgins is set to make over $20 million this season with the franchise tag but it is clear he wants long-term security as well.

Ochocinco ended his conversation with TMZ saying “It’s business — it’s the nature of the business. He’s going to be all right though.”

We will see what the long-term future holds for Higgins and the Bengals but as of right now I expect to see him suited up in week one and ready to roll."

The order sent by the Department of Justice to JP Morgan Chase bank asked for the records of any international financial transactions for the past five years involving Hunter his uncle James Biden and former business partners Devon Archer and Eric Schwerin according to federal documents.

The anti-corruption nonprofit Marco Polo founded by former Trump administration official Garrett Ziegler obtained the filing which targets the financial ties between the four men and the Bank of China.

The subpoena was issued by Delaware’s US Attorney David Weiss on May 15 2019. At the time Hunter’s father Joe Biden was a presidential candidate.

The subpoena was issued just five weeks after Hunter allegedly left his laptop in a Delaware repair shop. A total of 15 businesses owned by Hunter and his associates were listed on the legal document.

A spokesperson for Hunter could not be reached for comment Sunday night.



Last year Hunter revealed that he’s under investigation for possible tax fraud and he told “CBS This Morning” in April that he had no plans to strike a plea deal.

Hunter Biden 50 disclosed the probe in a statement released by his father’s presidential transition team.

“I learned yesterday for the first time that the US Attorney’s Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel also yesterday that they are investigating my tax affairs” Hunter said in the statement.

“I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately including with the benefit of professional tax advisors.”

The Justice Department investigation into Hunter Biden began in 2018 but was never disclosed before the election. A month after the election in December 2020 Hunter announced that the US Attorney’s Office in Delaware was “investigating my tax affairs.” Also under investigation were Hunter’s foreign business dealings.

In the weeks before the election then-Attorney General William Barr reportedly instructed prosecutors to keep the investigation hush-hush to avoid it becoming a campaign issue. But months earlier in the summer of 2020 Weiss already had decided to slow-walk the investigation until after the election for similar reasons according to Politico.

In October 2020 The Post exclusively revealed that a hard drive holding the contents of Hunter’s laptop contained a trove of emails detailing his controversial overseas business dealings as well as explicit photos and videos.

One especially raunchy video appeared to show him smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman.

The prime minister hosted the meeting at his office two days after the US financial giant announced it was acquiring approximately 49% of the Greek online bank Viva Wallet.

“As you are aware we have plans to expand over time so this may become a technology hub for JPMorgan Chase throughout the world” said Dimon the son of first-generation Greek immigrants.

“Viva is a great illustration of talent [that exists] in the engineering field” in Greece Dimon stated adding that this is a field that offers an “excellent way” for the economy to grow.

“I am excited about the progress you have achieved in Greece and we are also excited about acquiring 49% of Viva” he added.

The JPMorgan head went on to express his pride about being Greek “and I always think that if my grandparents – three of whom emigrated from the country in difficult times – were here they would have been surprised to see me at the helm of JPMorgan Chase and meeting with the prime minister.”

For his part Mitsotakis noted that JPMorgan’s decision constitutes a vote of confidence in the country and its economy and at the same time “reaffirms the new startup culture that has appeared in Greece.”

The prime minister added: “What I can tell you is that the country has turned a page and that Greece in 2022 has very few similarities with Greece at the time of economic crisis… I think we have laid the foundations for long-term and sustainable growth and we want you to be part of this story not just because of your Greek descent but because you truly see the opportunities that exist in the country.”

Participants in the meeting also included the head of the Prime Minister’s Economic Office Alex Patelis the head of JPMorgan Chase in Greece Stelios Papadopoulos and its global head of wholesale payments Takis Georgakopoulos.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vcHVjay5uZXdzL2Fja21hbi1idXlzLW5ldGZsaXgtZ2UtZ2V0cy10aGUtYXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ackman Buys the Dip & GE Gets the Ax,"SHARE

The bloom is off the rose for Netflix which has dropped some 40 percent in value ever since Wall Street decided that the former hyper-growth technology platform has become something decidedly less sexy: a maturing cash-positive media company. As my partner Matt Belloni recently wrote this is more than just a correction as part of the broader Nasdaq sell-off. Investors are afraid that more competition and weakening subscriber growth portends a harder more costly path forward. So naturally my friend Bill Ackman the hedge fund investor has stepped forward to buy the dip.

Ackman’s thesis is simple: the Netflix stock is oversold. On Friday January 21 Ackman’s firm Pershing Square Capital Management began accumulating more than 3.1 million shares—a position worth more than $1 billion. From a recent low of around $354 a share on January 24 the stock has rebounded to around $384 a share potentially giving Ackman a profit of some $90 million already. (He has not disclosed the average purchase price on his 3.1 million shares.) In a letter to his investors Ackman praised Netflix for its strong recurring revenue “best-in-class” management team formidable “pricing power” and the possibility of “substantial margin expansion” over a growing—albeit somewhat less rapidly than desired—subscriber base.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjIvMDEvMjkvaG93LXdpbGwtZXVyb3BlLWNvcGUtaWYtcnVzc2lhLWN1dHMtb2ZmLWl0cy1nYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How will Europe cope if Russia cuts off its gas?,"E VERY FOUR years the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas is required to carry out a simulation of disaster scenarios. In the most recent such exercise last year the ENTSOG boffins considered 20 shades of disaster and concluded that “European gas infrastructure provides sufficient flexibility for the EU Member States to…ensure security of gas supply.” Cheering words. But the gasmen did not examine the spectre now haunting Europe. What happens if Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine again the West hits Russia with sanctions and Mr Putin retaliates by shutting down all the pipelines carrying Russian gas to the West?

The conventional wisdom used to be that a complete shutdown of piped gas from Russia which makes up roughly a third of the gas burned in Europe was unthinkable. Thane Gustafson author of “Klimat” a thoughtful book on Russian energy observes that even at the height of the cold war the Soviet Union did not shut off gas exports. And during Russia’s fiercest dispute over gas with Ukraine in 2009 only the gas flowing through that country was disrupted and then only fleetingly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJsYW5kZXItYmxpbXAtdnMtc3BhY2UtcGVyc3BlY3RpdmUtMjIwMDAwODQxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlander's Blimp vs. Space Perspective's Balloon: Which Makes for a Better Trip?,"Exclusive air travel isn’t all private jets and helicopters anymore.

A controversial 13-kilometre pipeline through Richmond to supply jet fuel to the airport has been completed and is now being tested.

In the meantime construction is expected to continue until mid-2022 at the fuel receiving facility a tank farm located on the Fraser River east of No. 6 Road according to a project update published Friday.

In the first quarter of 2022 road work will be done on Williams Road and the facility will be hooked up to the municipal water system in the spring.

Work this spring on the third component the marine terminal includes installation of the foundation. The loading arms and gangway tower have already been installed.

The entire jet fuel delivery project is expected to be completed by early 2023.

The Vancouver Airport Fuel Facilities Corporation (VAFFC) – owned by most major airlines that use Vancouver International Airport (YVR) – is building the pipeline despite strong opposition from Richmond city council and environmental groups.

At the time when the Williams Road changes came to council for approval Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie called the public consultation on the project a “joke” and “a pretext of consultation.”

Several groups including Vapor and Fraser Voices were vocal in their opposition to the pipeline.

The previous line running from Burnaby to the airport north of Cambie Road is owned by Pembina formerly Kinder Morgan.

When the project was proposed the current pipeline was at capacity and the airport was being supplemented by 70 fuel truck deliveries per day.

Since the pandemic began in March 2020 however air travel has dropped significantly.

Large oil tankers are expected to come to the facility to deliver jet fuel which has raised concerns about spills and fires at the tank farm.

Richmond city council approved using $800000 from the jet fuel agreement to buy a high-flow industrial pump for Richmond Fire-Rescue to be used in the event of fire at the tank farm.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This time the foundation has teamed up with thirty unicorn founders and a couple of seasoned venture capital and private equity investors to launch a $200 million fund targeted at African startups.

The fund dubbed the Norrsken22 African Tech Growth Fund has reached its first close of $110 million per a statement seen by TechCrunch. It’s the latest fund launched by Norrsken after closing €125 million impact fund for European startups last March.

Hans Otterling a partner at Northzone a U.K.-based early VC firm that led the investment in Adalberth’s previous company Klarna is Norrsken’s founding partner alongside the Klarna co-founder.

Making up the firm’s investment are the general partners Natalie Kolbe the ex-global head of private equity at Actis a private equity fund investing in emerging markets; her colleague Ngetha Waithaka; and Lexi Novitske the ex-managing partner at Acuity Ventures Platform. Novitske told TechCrunch on a call that the firm is speaking to a few DFIs to reach a final close later this year.

Before Acuity Novitske was principal at Singularity Investments. Portfolio companies across both firms include API fintechs such as Mono and OnePipe; and exited companies like Flutterwave Paystack and mPharma.

Africa VC funding reached an all-time high in 2021 at over $4 billion more than what startups in the continent raised in the two previous years combined. Growth and late-stage deals such as $100 million-plus rounds from unicorns Andela Flutterwave Chipper Cash OPay and Wave and other companies largely propelled this growth. Nevertheless they were relatively fewer than early-stage deals per insights from Briter Bridges and The Big Deal.

There’s another issue besides the shortage of growth and late-stage checks. Most of these large deals are often financed by international VCs as local investors tend to focus on pre-seed to Series A rounds with micro to medium-sized funds.

“What’s happening is and we’ve seen this in our Acuity portfolio is that our founders as they grow and want to scale have to take time away from their business and spend it with Silicon Valley-based investors who they have to educate on the Africa growth story” said Novitske on a call with TechCrunch.

“These investors are coming with their capital which is valuable of course but they’re not coming with the local knowledge to help those companies scale across the continent. And that’s the missing middle that we’re looking to unlock with this fund.”

According to her Norrsken22 intends to be that growth-stage local-based firm that will enable startups to unlock significant partnerships to grow revenue find the best talent and facilitate expansion plans across Nigeria Kenya and South Africa.

The firm with offices in the countries above is the latest big-sized Africa-focused VC fund that includes the likes of TLcom Capital which recently closed nearly half of its new $150 million fund; Novastar Ventures a $200 million fund; and Partech Ventures a $143 million fund.

While the others seldomly invest above Series B rounds Norrsken22 is willing to go beyond that stage. Waithaka speaking on the fund’s strategy said Norrsken22 plans to invest 40% of its capital about $80 million in Series A and B companies and the rest in follow-on rounds from Series C up until exit.

The firm will make 20 investments at an average ticket size of $10 million and may go as high as $16 million including follow-on rounds in some portfolio companies he continued.

“I think that reserve capital pool is really important because we do want to have the ability to support companies through their entire lifecycle” said Kolbe picking up from where Waithaka left off in the conversation. “Innovation is uncertain and it doesn’t happen overnight so we want to be sure to be able to support the top winners in the company so they can be the champions in the tech ecosystem.”

Per sectors Norrsken22 will rely on its general partners’ years of experience and investment philosophies to back startups in fintech medtech edtech and market-enabling solutions such as B2B marketplaces and inventory management businesses.

Kolbe whose previous firm Actis backed Egyptian fintech giant Fawry in 2019 as it prepared to go public said Norrsken would look at Egypt ‘opportunistically.’ Deals from the country that may be of interest to the firm will be those planning an expansion into the four markets Norrsken22 is keen on right now: Nigeria Ghana Kenya and South Africa.

Of the $110 million first close reached by Norrsken22 $65 million comes from a group of unicorn founders globally.

NEWBERRY — Representatives from Kraft Heinz Company in Newberry left Barbara Chapman Newberry County Literacy Council’s director in shock after they presented her with a $10000 check on Jan. 20.

Chapman who was almost lost for words said she was overwhelmed after receiving the check from Kraft Heinz. However she said this money will help the Literacy Council open the doors to families in Newberry County. She said with COVID-19 numbers they may bring them in five or so at a time but they do not want any child to be left behind.

“The Kraft Heinz Foundation is really big about giving back to our community. Our plant was given an allotment of funds and we were asked where we wanted our funds to go; at our plant we have about 1500 employees and literacy is extremely important helping with our employees helping their children learn how to read” said Marcitta Hanner manufacturing manager at Kraft Heinz in Newberry. “We know she (Chapman) does a lot giving back teaching kids how to read so we wanted to open doors for our employees to give them different avenues and options to be able to help their children read and help them read as well.”

The relationship between Newberry County Literacy Council and Kraft Heinz in Newberry began last year during the Juneteenth event in the City of Newberry. Hanner said that Kraft Heinz had the opportunity to be a sponsor for the inaugural Juneteenth event.

“We were able to give out T-shirts goody bags; that started our relationship with the Literacy Council and from there we want to continue to grow our relationship and to continue to give back to the community” she said.

Hanner added that Juneteenth helped build a bridge between Kraft Heinz and the community.

“Kraft Heinz has been here in this community for over 50 years we are definitely trying to make a step in the right direction to give back to the community in which our employees live. This is a very good first step and we want to continue to do more” Hanner said.

Kat Longerbeam HR manager for Kraft Heinz in Newberry added that she thinks it is a great opportunity to give back to the community.

“We have had a lot of opportunities to give back and this is just one of many that we have done” she said.

Joseph McDonald who is on the Advisory Board for the Newberry County Literacy Council noted that the Kraft Heinz facility in Newberry and the Newberry County Literacy Council have both been in Newberry for about 50 years.

The Newberry Literacy Council is located at 1208 Main Street Newberry. To learn more about their services call 803-276-8086.

Totals so far as snow mucks up highways,"Scroll down for snowfall totals updated Saturday afternoon.

New Jersey woke up Saturday morning to double-digit snowfall along the coast but New Jersey 101.5 Meteorologist Dan Zarrow said at 9 a.m that we had ""turned the corner"" with snowfall expected to taper off through the afternoon.

While the threat of coastal flooding subsided Saturday morning additional light snowfall and drifting snow from the wind could continue to be a problem Zarrow said.

""It's a statewide event but the shore is getting clobbered the most"" Gov. Phil Murphy said Saturday morning during The Big Joe Henry Show on New Jersey 101.5.

Murphy on Friday declared a state of emergency and urged residents to hunker down on Saturday and stay off the roads. He told Big Joe that most people heeded that recommendation.

Murphy said more than 3000 pieces of road equipment were deployed across the state but the drifting snow would impede the progress of snow clearing into the afternoon.

See below for the snowfall totals so far on Saturday morning.

The blizzard conditions brought below-freezing winds but the state's utility companies were only reporting a smattering of power outages Saturday morning: JCP&L had about 600 customers without power Atlantic City Electric another 266 and PSE&G just a half dozen before 9:30 a.m.

The roads however were a different matter with slow-moving traffic and commercial vehicle restrictions on the state's interstate highways. Garden State Parkway remained snow-covered between the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway.

The region's airports canceled hundreds of flights Saturday morning. (Newark EWR info | Philadelphia PHL info | JFK info | LaGuardia info | Atlantic City info)

NJ Transit also suspended its bus services Saturday morning. Service was expected to resume Sunday morning. Rail service continued with weekend schedules.

The storm was expected to dump snow from Virginia to Maine with parts of Massachusetts expecting as much as 30 inches.

But with the offer of financial incentives and a seemingly-robotic process in place to handle everything moving in and out the Port of New York and New Jersey is one of the top gateways in the country for vehicle imports and exports.

""In 2021 through November we handled over 425000 automobiles"" Mike Bozza assistant director of commercial development for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told New Jersey 101.5. ""We are in the center of probably the largest consumer market in the world.""

Terminals in Newark and Jersey City are the port's hubs for this around-the-clock activity. Vehicles come over on so-called ro-ro vessels (the cargo is rolled on and off not shipped in containers) which are essentially floating parking decks.

""Some of then have up to 14 levels and they can carry over 8500 cars"" Bozza said.

The ports handle vehicles made by nearly all of the major players in the automobile business from Ford and Nissan to Maserati Ferrari and Polestar.

According to a blog post by PANYNJ the seaport's history with vehicles dates back more than six decades beginning with Foreign Auto Preparation Service Inc.'s move to Port Newark.

Today the port continuously ranks among the nation's top five pathways for vehicle exports and imports. Bozza said the port offers financial incentives to automakers that attract more volume to the Garden State.

Once an incoming vessel is docked a streamlined process unloads the vehicles into the auto processing facilities where workers inspect the vehicles and make other adjustments before the vehicles are shipped to dealers throughout the country.

""Certainly a vast majority of the vehicles that come here stay in this market"" Bozza said.

The terminals are also recipients of outgoing cars that make their way to New Jersey from spots such as Canada and the Midwest.

HARRIS COUNTY Texas (KTRK) -- A man in a 'wobbly wheel' scam is still on the run after targeting another man in October of 2021 at a Kroger parking lot on FM 1960 according to court documents.

The video above is from a previous related story on a separate 'wobbly wheel' scam.

Then on Thursday Harris County Precinct 4 deputies responded to another Kroger in the 11700 block of Idlewood Drive in reference to the same incident. After reviewing surveillance video deputies said they identified the suspect in the scam as Paul Yonko.

In the incident from 2021 records say the victim was flagged down by Yonko who told the man that his front wheel was wobbling. Yonko told the victim his car had a damaged part but that he worked at a repair place and could fix it documents say.

Yonko charged the man $325 for allegedly fixing the wheel but the victim later realized he had been scammed after coming across Yonko's name in an article mentioning his crime.

Further investigation revealed Yonko has two warrants for engaging in organized crime and failing to identify to police according to deputies.

They taped his arms and legs to a chair then stole two paintings and left.

The paintings “Man Leaning on a Sill” and “Portrait of an Elderly Woman” were by Rembrandt the revered Dutch Old Master painter dating to the 1640s. They were part of the art collection at 316 Pike Street and had been bequeathed to the people of Cincinnati by Charles Phelps Taft in 1927. They were appraised for insurance purposes for $250000 and $80000 respectively.

The theft made splashy headlines. “Two Taft Rembrandts Stolen.” “Art Theft Triggers International Hunt.” The Cincinnati police worked with the FBI and Interpol in hopes of recovering the paintings which could be sold on the black market or ransomed.

Enquirer art critic Owen Findsen wondered why the thieves had “selected two paintings of lesser importance than others they could have taken.” They had ignored the more significant Rembrandt “Portrait of a Man Rising from His Chair” which was temporarily exhibited with a companion portrait from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and was being shown on a different floor than usual.

Each day revealed bizarre twists in the case. “The entire episode took on the aura of a late-night mystery movie” The Enquirer wrote.

Cloak and dagger

That Tuesday night a man named James L. Hough called John W. Warrington the chairman of the Taft Museum Committee saying he had leads on where to find the paintings.

They agreed to meet at Tri-County Shopping Center. Hough pointed out the undercover cops in the mall as they talked in a coffee shop. He said he wanted a finder’s fee and would act as the museum’s agent in negotiating the return of the paintings.

“It all seemed sort of cloak-and-dagger to me at the time” Warrington told the Cincinnati Post.

The thieves communicating through telephone calls to Hough offered to return one of the paintings as proof they had the stolen art. Warrington said Hough dramatically pulled a sheet of instructions out of his shoe that sent him to a drop point in Warren County but nothing was there. The thieves had gotten nervous. A second drop point was also empty.

So Warrington went home where he received a call from Al Schottelkotte the venerable WCPO-TV newsman.

Unexpected scoop

“I’ve been in news work 30 years now had some rather strange unexpected things happen but possibly the most unexpected of all took place tonight” Schottelkotte said as he opened his 11 p.m. newscast on Dec. 20.

He stood on a WCPO soundstage along with Warrington who identified the recovered “Portrait of an Elderly Woman” in a gold-leaf frame on the air and Hough introduced as a “real estate broker” who had recovered the painting in a barn on Springdale Road near Blue Rock Road in Colerain Township.

Hough made it clear to viewers – and the thieves – that he was working as the go-between on behalf of the Taft Museum. When Hough recovered the painting instead of calling the police he had called the news anchor.

The following night Schottelkotte recounted meeting Hough at the Regis Lounge in Cheviot an hour before the news broadcast. He showed footage of Hough carrying the painting covered by a flowered pink quilt a lit cigarette between his fingers and placing it in the back seat of Schottelkotte’s Buick for transport to the WCPO studio.

“I doubt if my car will ever carry a more distinguished bit of freight” Schottelkotte said.

After the broadcast the painting was finally handed over to the police who were fuming off-stage.

Ransom demand

Nobody seemed to know much about Hough. Aside from his real estate company he co-owned the Speak-Easy Lounge in Cleves and was known to drive around with a pet lion cub in his car. “He emerges … as a sort of flamboyant figure on the outside – and a shadowy enigma on the inside” Enquirer reporter Marvin Beard wrote.

“Hey I know you know that I have got to be suspect No. 1 OK but I also know that I’m clean” Hough told reporters. “… I don’t think I’m a damn fool. I’ve got a good business.”

Through Hough the thieves demanded a ransom of $200000 but Warrington wouldn’t budge above $100000 to come from the museum’s endowment.

“They said if they don’t get $200000 they have a five-gallon can of gasoline and will burn the painting and mail the ashes to the museum” Hough said.

Yet after many calls the thieves eventually agreed to $100000 in unmarked 10s and 20s placed in two bags inside a suitcase. Hough was instructed to put the money in an ice machine at Lorelei Tavern in Fosters Warren County. After they counted the money they called back with the location of the other painting. It was found under the steps of a vacant house near Fosters. The only damage was a chip in the frame.

The police who had been holding back until the paintings were recovered immediately swooped in and arrested the thieves Carl Horsley and Henry Dawn and the getaway driver Raymond McDonough all from Loveland. The ransom money was recovered minus $18 which they had spent at Frisch’s.

The Taft Museum gave Hough a $15000 check as a finder’s fee but he returned it.

Double-crossed

During the grand jury session a secret informant named Donald Lee Johnson was given partial immunity in exchange for his testimony. Five men were indicted including Johnson and Hough the intermediary.

Hamilton County Prosecutor Simon L. Leis Jr. agreed to allow four of the defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges if they testified against Hough who was charged with extortion harboring a felon and receiving stolen goods.

On March 13 1974 a copyrighted story by reporter Peggy Lane outlined what The Enquirer had learned about the case but without names – a tale of a mastermind who was double-crossed and a bungled heist. In the trial that September the heist as explained by prosecution star witness Johnson played out just as the article had presented.

The so-called secret informant Johnson was identified as the mastermind. He had figured out a way to steal two Rembrandts from the Taft Museum and enlisted Horsley and Dawn but they didn’t seem to be interested. Instead they double-crossed Johnson and did the robbery without him.

Except they didn’t know that the more valuable Rembrandts had been moved so they stole the wrong paintings.

The thieves then turned to Johnson for help to sell the paintings and he contacted Hough whom he had previously used as a fence or dealer in stolen merchandise.

Johnson thought they could get $300000 for the paintings but he said Hough concocted the ransom scheme and contacted the museum officials.

Hough’s attorney Bernard J. Gilday Jr. questioned Johnson’s testimony and truthfulness. “It has not been established that Johnson is an expert burglar” he objected.

“I am Mr. Gilday” Johnson replied.

Horsley and Dawn were sentenced to one to five years in prison. Johnson and McDonough were sentenced to six months to five years.

Based on their testimony Hough was convicted on all three counts and sentenced to 3-20 years. He was paroled after 27 months then spent another year in prison for a parole violation. Despite being a felon Hough ran for sheriff of Franklin County Indiana in 1986 but did not win.

The final twist: art experts later determined that the two paintings were probably not by Rembrandt after all.

In November 10 people were killed at Travis Scott’s music festival in Houston Texas during a massive crowd surge. Attendees were packed so tightly that many couldn’t breathe or move their arms. Some 300 people were injured and treated at the festival while 25 were taken to hospitals. Nearly 400 lawsuits have been filed over injuries and deaths at the concert including many against the rap superstar and Live Nation.

Soon after the metal frontman addressed the heartbreaking disaster during a Slipknot show NME reported. He spoke to the crowd about the importance of looking out for one another.

The 48-year-old is immersing himself in new projects. He’s playing a rowdy trucker named Taco Tuesday in the thriller ""Rucker"" and is gearing up for his band to release new music. He’s also eager to kickstart his newest role as a filmmaker.

MÖTLEY CRÜE'S NIKKI SIXX OPENS UP ON SOBRIETY WHY HE LEFT CALIFORNIA FOR WYOMING: ‘IT’S HOME’

The vocalist spoke to Fox News about what fans can expect from Slipknot in 2022 working alongside his wife in ""Rucker"" and how Astroworld impacted him.

Fox News: Slipknot is releasing a new album sometime this spring. What can fans expect? How will it be different?

Corey Taylor: This album is really really good. I feel like we’ve kind of hit a groove on the last album ""We Are Not Your Kind."" We were really able to experiment with some cool textures and musical vibes that we hadn’t played with in a long time. For me I feel like this was an extension of what we were trying to do with ""Vol. 3."" There’s a lot of great musical vibes that people are gonna really freak out on but there’s still so much great heavy stuff. People are really gonna dig it. I actually like this album more than ""We Are Not Your Kind."" I can’t wait for people to hear it.

Fox News: What’s a misconception you feel people still have about Slipknot? What’s the reality?

Taylor: Oh God I mean where do you even start? There are so many. People to this day still think we’re this satanic band and we’re demonic and all this weird crap. It’s so easy for people to think that and then try to dismiss it. A lot of people still think this is all a gimmick. They don’t understand that this is art and the music for us has always been number one.

It’s not about shock. It’s not about anything else other than just having something exploratory and having something that the audience can be intrigued with. Something that pulls them in even if it is shocking. If it was anything other than just pure art and music people would’ve left us behind a long time ago. It’s because we immerse ourselves into the art the music the lyrics the visuals – just everything. That’s the reason why our fan base is actually bigger than it has been in years. To me I think that’s the biggest misconception … there’s so much more to what people see and hear that you don’t know where to begin.

Fox News: What has kept you going as an artist?

Taylor: The need to top myself. But also the need to try different things. You never want to get stuck in a rut and feel like you’re thematically repeating yourself. You want to keep challenging yourself as a writer a performer a musician. And that’s one of the reasons why I have so many different projects because there’s so much music I want to make.

If I could keep it all in one band I would. But sometimes you have to do other things. That’s also one of the reasons why I love Slipknot. We’ve been able to achieve so much by pushing our musical boundaries. It’s made our options kind of limitless. People want that heavy stuff but they also love it when we take left turns and try different things that really push the idea of what we do. To me as a songwriter that’s one of the biggest reasons why I still love what I do.

Fox News: Like many artists you paid tribute to the Astroworld victims in November. How did this tragedy impact you as an artist?

Taylor: It’s one of the things that scares you as a performer. The last thing you want is for anything to happen to your audience. We as a band as an organization we’ve always gone above and beyond to try and make sure that our fans are OK. Even back in the day when we were crazy and kind of doing insane stuff if anything ever happened to our fans we immediately stopped the show and made sure they were OK. We never carried on. We always made sure that security was the priority. Number one. That hasn’t changed to this day. It’s the one thing we try to focus on.

The issue that arose at Knotfest Mexico [in 2019] was because there was an unsafe situation in the audience. We and our security did not feel comfortable going back out there knowing that people might get injured. There was a broken barricade that we couldn’t fix. We physically couldn’t fix it. So we had to shut down. And because we did that most people left. There was a riot but nobody got hurt. They were taking it out on the instruments and the grounds and whatnot. But that’s the difference between us and a lot of other bands. We wouldn’t have felt good carrying on knowing that our fans might be in danger. It really comes down to what your priorities are.

Obviously I don’t know any of the people involved [in Astroworld]. And I don’t know anything more than what I've read in the news online. So I can’t make any judgments. All I can talk about is where we are [as a band] and where I am. And I can just say that I hope that something like this never happens at any one of our concerts.

Fox News: Why did you want to work in a film like ""Rucker""?

Taylor: It's more than just the story although the story was rad. But it was more about getting to work with [writer] Aaron Drane again which was really cool. He and I met and got along really well in ""Fear Clinic."" Over the years we stayed in touch and when the time came he was making this movie with [director] Amy [Hesketh]. He hit me up just to see if I would be a part of it. And lucky enough I had enough time to do it. So he sent me the script and I dug it.

The story almost feels like one of those urban legends you hear about something based on true events you know? A truck driver who gets away with murder because he doesn’t stay in one place. It reminds you of the I-95 serial killer. And then it adds that extra layer of the long-lost daughter that maybe he knew he had. And then there’s this weird family reunion. It was cool to watch all of that come together. There are moments of levity but then there are also some really dark moments that played so well especially with the characters and the actors doing it.

Fox News: Fans have been praising you for your appearance in the film. How does it feel to get that kind of support for something like acting?

Taylor: It’s pretty rad. I’ve never considered myself to be a real actor you know? I’m one of those people who because of what I do get offered extra stuff. So for me when I do it I take it very seriously. I’m not a method actor or anything but I do enjoy it.

And maybe that’s why people take it seriously when I do it because they know I only do things that I enjoy. I only do things that I’m going to take very seriously. And on this set we were in and out. We had a lot of fun. And my wife got to be in it too which is rad. I mean she got to be a murder victim which bummed me out *laughs*. But it was cool for us to have this experience together.

ELLEN FOLEY RECALLS HER EPIC DUET WITH MEAT LOAF: 'STOP RIGHT THERE!'

Fox News: What was it like working with your wife?

Taylor: She was so nervous. She still won’t watch it. But I’ll always tell her if something’s super cringey … We get along so well to the point where we can do anything together. It’s one of the reasons why we tour together when I do my solo thing. It’s one of the reasons why we work on projects together. And it’s why I was so stoked for her to be able to get this part. It was cool to watch her. And she did a really good job whether she thinks so or not. When you’re with someone who is cheering you on the entire time and you’re cheering them on it makes everything easy.

Fox News: Since we’re talking about horror what scares you the most and why?

Taylor: Oh sharks 100%. Sharks scare the ever-living out of me. Like for real I’ve been scared of sharks since I was a kid. My mom took me to see ""Jaws"" when I was very very little and that just imprinted on my brain so much that even swimming pools make me weird. But I have swum with sharks twice because I’m a maniac and I’ve seen every gnarly shark movie that’s ever been made. I was in ""Sharknado"" for Christ’s sake. That’s me fighting this fear as much as possible.

Fox News: What’s one thing you would like to accomplish this year that you haven’t done yet?

Taylor: I’m working on the production of the first movie that I ever wrote called ""Zombie vs. Ninja."" I wrote it a couple of years ago. It’s a slow start going through this process and getting that up from the ground. But we have a director we have financing and we have a full production behind it. We have a special effects team. I’m gonna score it.

All we need to do is cast it and book it. We’re gonna go for it. That’s one of my biggest dreams to see a movie of mine from start to finish … Hopefully this year we’ll be able to get a shot at this.

Fox News: Are there going to be any sharks?

Taylor: No not in this one *laughs*. Hopefully not in anything I do. If you ever wanted to see real terror hire me to be an actor in a shark attack movie. I don’t even know if I’d be able to get in the water. It would have to jump up into the boat to get me because there’s no way. It just freaks me out. I don’t know I don’t know if I can do it.

I see it as a direct follow up to Solo. My first single was about coming to terms with the loneliness that often comes hand in hand with building your own path in life. While making your way in the world is crucial so is being close to the people you care about now more than ever given what we've all been through. Life is now. It’s not in the past and it's not somewhere in a planned to perfection future.”

It’s not clear if his father Andrea will feature on the upcoming debut album at all but he’s certainly very proud of his son as shared exclusively with Express.co.uk.

They performed the popular track around the world and it even featured in Disney movie The Nutcracker and Four Realms. Since then Matteo has slowly begun debuting his solo career with a cover of Can You Feel The Love Tonight? alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the Disney Goes Classical album. Then last year the rising star released his first single Solo which has now been followed up by Close ahead of the 24-year-old’s first album later this year.

Earlier this month Matteo gave a live Q&A on social media following the release of Close and spoke briefly with his father who offered two major pieces of advice.

The 63-year-old said: “I believe that Matteo is identifying with more and more clarity his own style according to his own personality and sensibilities. And I believe that his very promising single Solo shows that. As for duets it is true that the song Fall On Me was a beautiful occasion that we have seized upon as a family perhaps without truly thinking it through but with great enthusiasm. And the public appreciated the genuineness of the emotions involved. But I also think that my son has today wings strong enough to take flight by himself.”

Andrea told his son: “You can do better always. You must do everything in order to improve your singing every day. And not to scream [and lose your voice].”

This reference to screaming was his father’s little joke since Matteo almost lost his voice promoting Close in the previous days.

In a written Instagram post the 63-year-old said: “Come what may you’ll always be ‘close’ to our hearts. But we hope your artistic journey will take you far! Good luck to our young artist Matteo for this next step in your career: we are by your side and just as your song says we always feel that you are “close” to us. Andrea Veronica Amos & Virginia.”

It doesn't have to be July 4 either to enjoy a beautiful collection of patriotic photos sent in by viewers from all over the country and chosen by the producers of ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" to appear at the start of the program every Saturday and Sunday.

The video shown at the top of this article is from the opening of the show at 6 a.m. on Sunday Jan. 30 2022.

As a recording of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" plays — performed by the U.S. Coast Guard Band on Sunday morning's segment — a gorgeous array of viewer photos are shown throughout.

Said cohost Pete Hegseth of ""Fox and Friends Weekend"" ""Thank you again America. From beer flags to sand flags to chalk flags to sack races [these are] amazing photos from you our viewers on this Sunday morning Jan. 30 2022.""

Cohost Will Cain noted that the photos shown on the program each weekend morning are not recycled or reused — each program features new images. ""I've yet to see a repeat"" he said.

Viewers across America keep sending them in on a regular basis.

""I just love that picture of the two little siblings with the flag wrapped around them"" added cohost Rachel Campos-Duffy — and she mentioned other favorites as well.

This has ""become one of the best databases in America"" of patriotic photos noted Hegseth.

Born to Elvis Presley and his wife Priscilla in 1968 nine months to the day after their wedding night Lisa Marie had a far from normal childhood. After her parents separated in 1972 she would spend a lot of her holiday time with The King at his Graceland mansion. Since the star was a night owl who slept all day his daughter would have full run of the estate with the other kids in the Memphis Mafia.

Describing herself as “a terror” during his childhood Lisa Marie knew she could get away with pretty much anything admitting that Elvis was not a strict father at all. After The King’s death in 1977 Graceland opened as a museum in 1982 and the archives team found all sorts of treasures left in drawers like the samurai sword in the living room. Another awesome find was some secret childhood graffiti the mischievous Lisa Marie left inside a drawer. It’s located in the corridor next to the kitchen on the way towards the Jungle Room from the front door. So if you’re visiting on the regular walk-through tour you can walk right past it and what’s inside is a real piece of history.

READ MORE Natalie Wood and Elvis Presley's first date like no other Scrawled by Elvis’ daughter inside the drawer is a message that reads: “Lisa’s home Graceland” followed by a smiley face. Also found sitting inside is a 1993 phonebook which also holds some historical significance. This was owned by The King’s Aunt Delta who was the sister of his father Vernon. After her husband died in 1966 she was invited to live at Graceland alongside her mother Elvis’ grandmother Minnie Mae who was already living there. Following The King’s death in 1977 her brother Vernon died in 1979 and then their mother Minnie aka Dodger followed in 1980.

Lisa Marie still sees Graceland as home

Elvis timeline

But the time that Graceland opened for tours in 1982 Aunt Delta was still living at the mansion and her bedroom and the kitchen remained off-limits to give her space. At the end of the day she would be allowed free range of the rest of the mansion leaving some of her possessions including the phone book around the house. The reason it’s from 1993 is because that was the year she died at the age of 74. During Lisa Marie’s childhood Aunt Delta would be responsible for making sure that Elvis’ daughter had her dinner and a bath although would occasionally get a cheeky talking back to. DON'T MISS

Bahrain was the first country in the Gulf region to acquire the F-16 and the first in the world to procure the advanced F-16 Block 70.

Bahrain will have a fleet of 16 F-16s which is the world’s most successful combat-proven multirole fighter. It builds interoperable capabilities within air forces enhancing partnerships with allies and supporting national defense and security for nations around the world.

“The latest generation Lockheed Martin F-16 training suite allows aviators to train in a holistic realistic environment which ensures mission readiness” said retired U.S. Army Gen. John W. Nicholson chief executive for Lockheed Martin in the Middle East. “This comprehensive training solution builds on our proven training systems tailored for the Block 70 fleet of F-16s.”

Since 2001 aviators from 16 allied nations have trained with Lockheed Martin F-16 training systems. To prepare F-16 pilots the training suites will provide a simulation-based training environment that replicates all systems sensors and weapons for a total training solution that can be networked together so pilots can train in various scenarios aligning technologies to deliver advanced training while meeting affordability goals.

With Lockheed Martin manufacturing both the F-16 and producing the full mission trainers there is increased fidelity in the aircraft’s flight simulators. In addition to flight training Lockheed Martin has provided F-16 maintenance training globally for over 25 years to fully support all aspects of the aircraft.

The OUSV concept is a response to the U.S. Navy’s future plan to field Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSV) to perform “shooter” missions firing strike missiles from Mark 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells hidden in 40-foot ISO shipping containers. Naval News reached out to Lockheed Martin for comment.

Jennifer Stringfellow of Lockheed Martin’s Communications Department replied via email:

“The Optionally Unmanned Surface Vessel (OUSV) model at SNA [2022] represents the configuration that the [U.S] Navy tested in November of 2020 as part of their Ghost Fleet program. In that demonstration the OUSV used the ExWS [Expeditionary Warfare System] to successfully fire an SM-6. The model also shows a containerized SEWIP BLK II [Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program Block II] system that can be used as an existing Program of Record sensing system for the OUSV Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel or other non-traditional asset / location. Lockheed Martin is also developing containerized active sensors to further expand the mission sets ExWS can accomplish. ExWS components are designed to meet commercial ISO handling requirements enabling rapid embarkation of the system to any platform or location that can support 20ft or 40ft ISO containers.

Lockheed Martin and the Department of Defense have developed scalable Aegis capability that enables platforms that were previously too small for Aegis to be equipped with the world’s most advanced combat management launching and sensor systems. This Expeditionary Weapon System family of products has been successfully tested at multiple live fire events and is in the process of fielding to a variety of customers the first of which is the U.S. Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office who is using this technology for their Mid-Range Capability program.”



Jennifer Stringfellow Lockheed Martin’s Communications

As Ms. Stringfellow stated Lockheed Martin’s OUSV draws from the Aegis radar system to network and link with the Mark 41 VLS cells transported in 40-foot ISO shipping containers on its (optionally unmanned) ship platform deck for greater Distributed Maritime Operations and Distributed Lethality. Doing this aids the U.S. Navy fleet in spreading the weapons and ship formation further apart for increased missile strike surprise and ship and fleet survivability.

The open deck of the OUSV platform allows for easier logistical reloading and rearming of strike missiles by just removing and swapping out the 40-foot ISO shipping containers by crane since warship VLS cells once fired cannot be currently replenished at sea. Therefore the Fleet Commander can mix-and-match VLS missiles to suit a variety of mission needs and requirements by just replacing ISO containers on deck.

The OUSV can transport and fire all the missiles in the Mark 41 VLS missile inventory portfolio and these include Tomahawk land-attack and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missiles; Standard Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) missiles; Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) for AAW ASuW and Anti-missile defense; and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) rockets (ASROC). Thus the OUSV can strike and defend from as close to a few miles out with ASROC to over 1000+ miles with Tomahawk cruise missiles and sail independently in groups and close or far away from the main surface fleet.

Naval News and Author’s Comments

The Lockheed Martin OUSV model fits within the U.S. Navy’s optionally unmanned surface vessel program of Medium Unmanned Surface Vessels (MUSV) as the “sensors” and Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs as the “shooters”) to form the U.S. Navy’s “Kill Web” network to link “sensors-to-shooters” for an optionally unmanned fleet.

Additional custom shipping containers or trailers to fire larger Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) hypersonic missiles can hypothetically also be accommodated on the OUSV to give the U.S. Navy more ship platforms and options for firing CPS hypersonic missiles than just the modified Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers (DDG 1000s) the next-generation destroyers (DDG(X) and the Navy’s nuclear-powered guided missile submarines (SSGNs).

The OUSV with Mark 41 VLS shipping containers can finally fulfill the U.S. Marine Corps’ desire to have long-range strike and AAW ASW ASuW and Anti-missile self-defense VLS cells for their amphibious ship fleet such as the LPD-17. VLS cells for the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) are often provided by escorting warships such as the DDG 51 Arleigh Burke destroyers and many ARGs often don’t possess as many destroyers compared to a U.S. Navy Carrier Strike Group (CSG) if sailing alone. If assigned and employed the OUSV with Mark 41 VLS containers can be controlled by and from an amphibious ship leaving the escorting VLS warships to sail off to perform other duties independent of the three L-class ship ARG that all intrinsically lack Mark 41 VLS cells in their hulls.

No matter which manufacturer is selected to build the LUSVs having optionally unmanned ships such as Lockheed Martin’s OUSV would also be a great benefit to the U.S. Navy’s upcoming Light Amphibious Warships (LAWs) of which 20 to 30 are planned to be built to transport 75 Marines and their vehicles around the INDO-PACOM region on a typical 30-day mission.

These poorly-armed LAWs (current armament fit is undecided but plans call for just one 25mm or 30mm autocannon and several .50 caliber heavy machine guns for self-defense) lack any form of guided missiles for offensive and defensive purposes and will be especially vulnerable to any form of enemy ranged attack. LUSVs with VLS shipping containers can provide the ASW AAW ASuW Anti-missile and land attack missiles via 8 to 16 Mark 41 VLS cells that the LAWs will need for self-protection and to implement a deterrence greater than the weapons’ ranges carried by the LAW’s Marines and their assigned helicopter and vehicles. In addition the two SEWIP Block 2 jamming emitter array modules will protect the OUSV from incoming enemy missile fire.

Any LUSV has integral berthing to accommodate passengers and Lockheed’s OUSV static model design can have U.S. Marines aboard to provide shipboard defense via small arms rocket launchers Anti-tank guided missiles and Stinger Short-range Air Defense (SHORAD) missiles for a closer protective envelope that the OUSV’s Mark 41 VLS cells cannot offer.

Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of the OUSV design is that the LUSV design is considered fast able to sail at speeds above 30+ knots depending on the winning hull design selected. Based on an open-deck commercial logistics cargo transport ship LUSVs can sail faster than the big ARG L-class amphibious ships that typically sail around 20 knots and thus LUSVs can keep up with U.S. Navy capital warships to provide additional VLS cell firepower whenever and wherever required. This high hull speed is important to deploy LUSVs with their Mission Module shipping containers to locations around the globe upon theater Combat Commander request or to disperse VLS naval fire support to U.S. Marines and Army soldiers ashore when called for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlicnVpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8zMC9vcGluaW9uLXVjbGEtbXVzdC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZS1ob2xkaW5ncy1mb3ItdGllcy10by11eWdodXItZ2Vub2NpZGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: UCLA must investigate holdings for ties to Uyghur genocide,"As the Uyghur genocide continues to unfold our institutions don’t deserve the benefit of the doubt.

The Uyghurs are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority that live in the autonomous region of Xinjiang. The Chinese government under the semblance of counterterrorism seeks to deprive Uyghurs of their religious and cultural identities.

Many human rights organizations have documented the mass internment torture and religious persecution of Uyghurs at the hands of the Chinese government. Other allegations include forced labor sterilization and reeducation – all amounting to the official label of genocide according to the U.S. Department of State.

In response to the Chinese government’s exploitation of Uyghurs President Joe Biden recently signed a bill that limits the importation of goods from Xinjiang. While economic and political maneuvers on a national level are crucial for condemning the Uyghur genocide there are still key players who haven’t kept pace: universities.

UCLA should independently investigate its endowment for potential ties to the Uyghur genocide and divest accordingly. In doing so the university would act in solidarity with Uyghurs and other oppressed minorities of Xinjiang.

In October 2021 students at The Catholic University of America passed a resolution urging their administration to investigate its endowment for ties to the Uyghur genocide. This includes Catholic University’s “direct holdings externally managed funds and all financial instruments” as well as its “research collaborations.”

In turn Catholic University’s administration agreed to independently examine its endowment for connections to the Uyghur genocide becoming the first university in the country to do so.

Rory O’Connor a second-year student at Catholic University helped draft the resolution alongside members of the student government. O’Connor said if universities wish to continue receiving money from the public they’re obligated to end their involvement in crimes against humanity.

In addition Yale University’s Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility will investigate Chinese companies for ties to human rights violations as reported by the Yale Daily News on Wednesday. Earlier this month an anonymous Yale student urged the administration to divest from Chinese companies given the draconian practices of the Chinese Communist Party.

As one of the top public universities UCLA should follow this precedent and send a message about financial ethics to other schools in the country.

“Investment managers need to screen (university) holdings against the list of companies at high risk of violating U.S. law” said Louisa Greve director of global advocacy for the Uyghur Human Rights Project.

This includes a number of Chinese surveillance companies on the U.S. blacklist Greve added.

Instead the UCLA Foundation in an emailed statement from spokesperson Katherine Alvarado stated its investments are compliant with U.S. law.

“As an institution we generally do not invest in securities directly either in the US or abroad and thus do not engage in security screening for the endowment” the UCLA Foundation said in the emailed statement. “We and our managers are aware of the securities on the U.S. Dept of Commerce Entities List as well as Treasury’s (Office of Foreign Assets Control) list. These names are not included in UCLA’s investments.”

However being compliant with U.S. law isn’t necessarily proof of ethical investment practices. For instance BlackRock one of the key backers of weapons manufacturing manages the University of California’s assets. BlackRock-funded companies such as Lockheed Martin supplied the means for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.

Still the UCLA Foundation incorporates environmental social and governance risks into the investment program. The ESG factors a common metric assigned to corporations are designed to uphold certain principles including human rights.

While this may seem reassuring there are limitations to ESG risk assessment.

In “The World May Be Better Off Without ESG Investing” Hans Taparia a clinical associate professor at the New York University Stern School of Business describes how this process works and highlights that Amazon typically receives a high ESG score because the company’s good environmental performance compensates for its exploitation of workers.

Using this same logic companies can potentially receive high composite ESG ratings despite their connections to human rights violations.

According to Hong Kong Watch investors often pay less attention to human rights abuses in China because these grievances fall under the “social” factor of ESG something that’s often difficult to calculate. To demonstrate this issue researchers point out that “more than 34 per cent of the bonds in the ESG version JP Morgan EMBI index” came from countries classified as “not free” according to Freedom House. Likewise “Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity ESG Portfolio R Acc finds over forty-five percent of equities in emerging Asian countries” with Alibaba and Tencent two major Chinese technology companies “accounting for over ten percent of the total fund.” Alibaba has developed facial recognition software that can identify Uyghur individuals while Tencent has allegedly surveilled users of its popular app WeChat.

Since ESG practices fail to uphold human rights at times universities should take extra care to examine their financial holdings and divest if necessary.

If somehow UCLA isn’t convinced to take steps to ensure that it isn’t complicit in genocide perhaps it will be able to empathize with its peers in academia being targeted in Xinjiang.

In December 2021 the UHRP released a report that highlights the suppression of at least 312 Uyghur intellectuals and cultural elites. The UHRP stated these individuals come from many different professions such as “medical experts university professors editors poets and singers.”

UCLA has a moral responsibility to support the human rights and freedoms of academics around the world. A thorough investigation into its endowment would ensure there’s no breach of UCLA’s mission to aid the global community.

Given the loopholes and ambiguity of ESG risk assessment in the corporate world UCLA should take matters into its own hands.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3Mvc2t5LWlzLW9uLWZpcmUtYmVoaW5kLXRoaXMtYy0xMzAtaGVyY3VsZXMtbW9uc3Rlci1ub3QtaW1wcmVzc2VkLTE3OTg4Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sky Is on Fire Behind This C-130 Hercules Monster Not Impressed,"Back in the years after the Second World War the American military realized there would probably be a lot more conflicts coming America's way wars it will have to take part in. For that to happen the nation needed not only battle hardware but new support and transport machines as well.

The C-130 Hercules was one of those machines made with support purposes in mind. Cooked up in the hangars of Lockheed it was introduced in 1956 as a transport aircraft and has been in service in a number of versions ever since.One of the best things about this four-engined beast is that it is capable of landing and taking off from more or less improvised runways. Thanks to that it still is “the prime transport for airdropping troops and equipment into hostile areas” as per the U.S. Air Force (USAF).Capable of carrying up to 42000 pounds (19000 kg) of cargo the plane can fly them to their destination at speeds of up to 417 mph (671 kph) and at altitudes of up to 28000 feet (8615 meters) depending on variant used.Back in 2018 when it last made a count of the hardware the USAF said there were still over 400 of these planes in operation across the country. The one we have here is deployed with the 133rd Airlift Wing of the Minnesota Air National Guard.And it became kind of a minor celebrity thanks to the image we have here released by the military branch last week and showing the plane as it was sitting not on some improvised runway but on a solid one at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul Joint Air Reserve Station.The photo shows it sitting unimpressed but impressive against an almost flaming sky making it a perfect fit for this Saturday’s Photo of Day section.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2FlZ2lzLW1pc3NpbGUtZGVmZW5zZS1zeXN0ZW0td2l0aC1uZXctc3B5LXJhZGFyLWphcGFuL9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2FlZ2lzLW1pc3NpbGUtZGVmZW5zZS1zeXN0ZW0td2l0aC1uZXctc3B5LXJhZGFyLWphcGFuLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Upgrades AEGIS Missile Defense System With New ‘SPY Radar’ As Chinese Korean Threats Endanger Japan,"Japan’s geographical position puts it in a peculiar spot as it is in close proximity with two of its biggest adversaries China and North Korea. With the growing advancements in the missile arsenal of both the communist nations it becomes imperative for the Japanese military to strengthen its strategic defenses.

Lockheed Martin has completed a successful demonstration of its new SPY-7 radar and software integration program for the AEGIS missile defense system which is planned for deployment by Japan’s Self Defense Forces according to a press statement issued by the company.

“The SPY-7 radar brings superior capability to sea or land-based platforms utilizing proven production technology scaled from the Long Range Discrimination Radar which recently achieved initial fielding in Clear Alaska” Lockheed Martin Naval Combat and Missile Defense Systems Vice President Joe Depietro said in the release.

The successful demonstration of the entire ballistic missile defense fire control loop according to the corporation was a key milestone in the development of the SPY-7 outfitted Aegis Combat System.

The press release further mentioned that the test was overseen by both the US Missile Defense Agency and the US Navy Aegis Technical Representative.

“Lockheed Martin successfully demonstrated the integration of the AN/SPY-7(v)1 radar into the Aegis Weapon System for Japan executing the processing required to detect track and discriminate ballistic missile threats and successfully guide interceptors to those threats” the release said on January 27.

We’re proud to announce the U.S. government designated our Solid State Radar the AN/SPY-7(V)1. SPY-7 has been chosen by Japan for two Aegis Ashore installations and will provide continuous surveillance and protection over the Pacific.

The US defense and aerospace giant is making changes to its Moorestown New Jersey production test center in preparation for the live SPY-7 radar integration and test for Japan’s Aegis System Equipped Vessel (ASEV) program.

This test facility will be used to validate end-item hardware and software performance prior to shipment to Japan provide early lessons learned to streamline equipment installation on the ASEV ship platform and support maintenance and training efforts prior to system deployment as with other radar programs of this magnitude.

Need For New Missile Defense System

By adding ballistic missile defense capability to Aegis destroyers and deploying the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Japan has been gradually enhancing its defenses against ballistic missile threats since 2004. The SDF is now using radars satellites aircraft and ships to monitor the area surrounding Japan according to its Ministry of Defense.

An automatic warning and control system known as Japan Aerospace Defense Ground Environment (JADGE) gathers and processes information recorded by radars across the country in order to respond quickly to ballistic missiles moving towards Japan.

The system can instantly send Aegis destroyers on the far side of the ocean to intercept missiles after automatically calculating the likely impact area. But the previous attempts to deploy the radar station ashore proved unsuccessful.

Earlier in 2020 the planned deployment of the two Aegis air defense radar stations designed to detect and counter North Korean ballistic missiles in Japan was abruptly halted as previously reported by Japan Times.

Japan halts deployment of Aegis Ashore missile defence system https://t.co/DZpnZlu8US pic.twitter.com/bOtl3lCtbi — Reuters (@Reuters) June 15 2020

The then-Defense Minister Taro Kono had said that the delay in Japan’s plans to deploy two Aegis systems to Japan Ground Self-Defense Force facilities in Akita Prefecture in the north and Yamaguchi Prefecture in the south were a result of financial and technical concerns.

The Defense Ministry has faced substantial opposition from local governments and residents at both sites citing radiation risks from the system’s Long Range Discrimination Radar.

However the situation seems to have changed and Lockheed’s demonstration could mean that the deployment is delayed but not canceled. However there exists no clarity on what and how this deployment is going to happen. As of now Japan’s Aegis-equipped destroyers continue to provide ballistic missile defense against North Korean rockets.

SPY-7 Radars

SPY-7 is a scalable radar capable of defending against both ballistic and anti-air missiles. Through initiatives like Aegis Aegis Ashore and LRDR this technology can safeguard the military and citizens at sea ashore and around the world.

The SPY-7 radar outperforms standard SPY-1 radars by several orders of magnitude allowing it to detect track and fight sophisticated ballistic missile threats including several threats at once.

SPY-7 shares the same technology as the Long Range Discrimination Radar which will be deployed to the US government in 2022. The US government has designated SPY-7 technology as Technical Readiness Level 7 indicating that it has been tested in an operationally relevant setting. Since 2018 the radar has been tracking and emitting air and space objects at a Lockheed Martin test site.

SPY-7’s material building block is gallium nitride (GaN) which enables for greater cooling of the radar resulting in higher and maintained performance. The radar is built up of thousands of small scanners instead of a single array scanning across an area. The radar’s sub-array-based structure makes it simple to upgrade as threats change.

The persistent missile defense system which is equipped with the latest digital solid-state radar technology will connect the SPY-7 radar with their previously deployed Aegis Combat System allowing for continuous protection of Japan according to Lockheed Martin."

Pearl is known for her address book of vintage haunts and hideaway places so we're not surprised to see vintage rugs decorative ornaments and quirky objects tastefully brightening up every corner.

The bohemian-style kitchen is from deVOL's Real Shaker Kitchen range and includes one long run of cupboards painted in 'Linen' a central 'Scullery Yellow' kitchen island with a stylish copper worktop for food prep a fluted sink and a magnificent light brown marble surface that makes the space feel bright and airy.



While designer Pearl and musician Danny painted the walls in Farrow & Ball's  they left the wooden frame around the windows natural adding a lace curtain for privacy. To complete the look the couple opted for deVOL's handmade Cotes Mill Tiles for their splashback and chose a characterful wall cupboard from the furniture manufacturer's Haberdasher's Kitchen range. The flooring was painted in Little Greene's .



As an open plan space for entertaining family and friends this kitchen has it all. And with a rustic and homely feel it's the ideal spot to relax too.

deVOL

'We love the kitchen and its endless little vignettes that make photographing so appealing and satisfying. But it is designer Pearl's ability to create a really functional family kitchen that is also seriously desirable and totally welcoming and comfortable that is most impressive' deVOL explains.

'You instantly want to stay and hang out you want to admire the space but you feel drawn to its homely and comforting vibe. This is a gift acknowledging every aspect of a room's function and not just making it look good. That is the true sign of a talent in our opinion and also a testament to Pearl's love of family and friends and gathering them together in a warm and inviting and totally cool space.'

Lowe’s is teaming up with Petco to offer pet departments within its stores betting that customers want cans of dog food along with their cans of paint.

The first Lowe’s with a Petco is expected to open in February in Alamo Ranch Texas. Fourteen additional Lowe’s locations in Texas North Carolina and South Carolina will get Petco centers by the end of March the company said.

The Petco mini stores will offer food as well as pet services including vaccination clinics. Mobile grooming services will also be offered.

The is the first store-within-a-store pairing for both Lowe’s and San Diego-based Petco. Petco operates more than 1500 stores in the U.S. Mexico and Puerto Rico. Lowe’s has 2200 stores in the U.S. and Canada.

Mooresville North Carolina-based Lowe’s noted that more than 11 million new pets entered U.S. homes since the start of the COVID pandemic. The company said it makes sense to serve both.

“For many of our customers their pets and their homes top the list of things that matter most especially after two years spent mostly together within the same four walls” said Bill Boltz Lowe’s executive vice president of merchandising.

The move could set Lowe’s apart from rival Home Depot which doesn’t sell pet food and help it compete with stores like Menards and Tractor Supply which also sell pet food and home improvement products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYW5sdWlzb2Jpc3BvL25hbWUvaGFyb2xkLWxvd2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzI2NTk2NzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harold Lowe Obituary (1919 - 2022) - Santa Margarita CA - San Luis Obispo County Tribune,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sanluisobispo/name/harold-lowe-obituary?id=32659670 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYW5sdWlzb2Jpc3BvL25hbWUvaGFyb2xkLWxvd2Utb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzI2NTk2NzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Police say Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan being chased by HPD in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving the 38-year-old in a coma for weeks.

A civil lawsuit from Sinapati blamed HPD for the wreck that also injured five others.

In February - Honolulu’s city council approved the settlement.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June.

All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

Perkins Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses.

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021. After a fantastic start that had the Bulls leading the Eastern Conference in 2021-22 Ball averaged 13.0 points 5.4 rebounds 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals before a knee injury 35 games into the season.

His inactivity has caused his contract to become a blight on the Bulls' salary cap.

Ball was the No. 2 overall pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2017 NBA draft and eventually was traded to the Pelicans as part of the Anthony Davis blockbuster deal."

It has the advantage of being part of hospitality giant Marriott International’s portfolio of brands currently at 30 and counting but also allows for a real diversity of hotels within it.

From the traveller’s point of view this can be an advantage. As Tina Edmundson Global Brand and Marketing Officer at Marriott International commented in 2021:

“We know guests are seeking to immerse themselves in the richness of the locale to discover what defines the destination and to experience one-of-a-kind hotels.

“Our Collection brands provide travellers with … truly authentic experiences enveloped in the convenience and amazing benefits of being part of the Marriott Bonvoy portfolio.”

From the hotel owner or operator’s point of view it means they can keep for instance the historic name of the hotel without having to rebrand it simply as a “Marriott Hotel’.

While the hotels within the group are independent in feel Marriott has always maintained that they are required to go through the same hotel and operator approval processes as other Marriott full-service hotels and need to “demonstrate continued high guest satisfaction and quality assurance scores to remain part of The Autograph Collection”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9hcHBvaW50bWVudC83OTAyMzI5NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mike Kass has been appointed General Manager at The Westin Maui Resort & Spa Ka'anapali in Lahaina,"Most recently Kass served as general manager of the San Francisco Marriott Marquis where he oversaw a $140 million hotel refurbishment.

United also maintains a handful of non-alliance partnerships with various airlines. These partnerships let United customers gain access to even more cities around the world. You can earn and redeem miles with these partners in most cases though some may have restrictions.

But when you book United flights from the continental U.S. to Hawaii on miles an inter-island flight on Hawaiian Airlines could be ""free"" thanks to United's excursionist perk.

Here's a look at all of United's non-alliance airline partners:

Aer Lingus.

Earning United miles with partners

From airlines to car rental companies United has a ton of different partners that you can earn and redeem miles with. Here's a quick overview:

Earning miles with United airline partners

You can earn United miles when you add your MileagePlus number to flights operated by any one of United's various partners. You'll earn miles based on how much you spend if United issues your ticket (booked through United.com) and distance flown if a partner tickets your flight.

The number of miles you'll earn on partner tickets depends on the airline you're flying the fare class you're booked in and your United Premier status level. For example a Lufthansa flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Frankfurt (FRA) booked in N fare premium economy would earn 5806 miles as N fares earn 100% mileage flown. This is because the flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Frankfurt Germany (FRA) is 5806 miles.

(Screenshot from united.com)

Each United Premier status level gets its own mileage bonus on partner flights. Silver Gold Platinum and 1K elites earn 25% 50% 75% and 100% bonus miles on partner tickets respectively. So if you're a Premier 1K member you'd earn 11612 United miles on the LAX-FRA ticket mentioned earlier.

You can also earn Premier qualifying points (PQPs) and Premier qualifying flights (PQFs) from United's partners. However note that some fare classes may be ineligible for mileage credit. Furthermore United has limited the PQPs you can earn on a given flight.

You can view the earning rates for all of United's airline partners on United's website. Review these pages closely — sometimes airlines restrict mileage earning to specific routes and fare classes.

Transferring miles from Chase Ultimate Rewards

One of our favorite ways to earn United miles is through Chase Ultimate Rewards. You can transfer your Ultimate Rewards points to United at a 1:1 ratio meaning that 10000 Ultimate Rewards points are equal to 10000 United miles.

In many cases earning United miles through Chase Ultimate Rewards credit cards is more lucrative than spending on one of the United cards we mentioned earlier. While you don't get airline-specific benefits like checked bags you can earn more miles on everyday purchases. And you can transfer your Ultimate Rewards points to other airlines if you find a better mileage deal.

Redeeming miles on partner flights

(Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy)

United recently switched to dynamic award pricing for all partner award tickets. The price of most partner awards went up by at least 10% in early 2020 making United miles significantly less valuable for partner awards. Regardless it's good to have the option to redeem miles on these flights if you have miles available to you.

That said United generally prices award space on its planes lower than flights operated by partners. Unfortunately United charges additional miles if you connect from a United flight to a partner flight.

(Screenshot from united.com)

For example you could book a flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Oslo Norway (OSL) via Zurich (ZRH) for 33000 United miles one-way in economy class. In this example itinerary United operates the SFO to ZRH segment and Swiss operates the ZRH to OSL segment. United would charge 30000 miles for just the SFO to ZRH flight so you are paying an extra 3000 miles for the inter-Europe flight.

Still this means that you can leverage United's partner flight network to fly to destinations not served by United for not too many additional miles. Essentially you can fly to just about anywhere in the world using your United miles.

You can find award space for virtually all United partners on the United website. This includes non-alliance partners like Aer Lingus and Hawaiian Airlines as well as all of the carrier's Star Alliance partners. United's website is often considered the best Star Alliance search tool.

Reciprocal elite status benefits

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

All United Premier elites get reciprocal benefits on all Star Alliance carriers. United Premier Silver members are eligible for Star Alliance Silver status while United Premier Gold and above are eligible for the more lucrative Star Alliance Gold status. These benefits can make your flight experience easier when flying on partner carriers.

To take advantage of your Star Alliance benefits when flying partners just add your United MileagePlus number to a partner booking. Here's a look at both Star Alliance Silver and Star Alliance Gold benefits:

Star Alliance Silver

Star Alliance Silver status is pretty bare bones. It includes very minimal benefits that while helpful won't drastically change your airport experience.

These benefits include:

Priority wait-listing: If your desired class of service isn't available at the time of booking your status gives you higher priority on the waitlist. This does not apply to award tickets.

If your desired class of service isn't available at the time of booking your status gives you higher priority on the waitlist. This does not apply to award tickets. Priority airport standby: Your status gives you higher priority on the standby list for your preferred flight except when you are traveling on an award ticket. This can be helpful if you want to fly on an earlier flight.

Star Alliance Gold

Things get more interesting with Star Alliance Gold status. These members are eligible for more tangible benefits like lounge access and priority security.

Here's a look at the full suite of Star Alliance Gold benefits:

Gold Track security: You can use dedicated Gold Track security lanes before Star Alliance flights.

You can use dedicated Gold Track security lanes before Star Alliance flights. Extra baggage allowance: You can take an extra 44 pounds of checked baggage on partner flights. Plus most Star Alliance airlines let you check an additional piece of baggage for free. Note that select Basic Economy fares are exempt from this benefit.

Bottom line

United has a slew of different partners making it one of the easiest airlines with which to earn miles. We highly recommend starting with a Chase Ultimate Rewards card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card if you're just beginning your mileage journey. After all you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to United (and other programs).

When it comes to redeeming miles you'll get the best deals by redeeming United miles for flights operated by United. However you can still leverage the airline's vast partner network to redeem miles if United doesn't serve your destination of choice.

The awarding ceremony the 2022 ASEAN Tourism Awards was held at Sokha Beach Resort Preah Sihanouk Province Kingdom of Cambodia last January 19 2022. H.E Ms. Maria Amelita C. Aquino Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of the Philippines to the Kingdom of Cambodia Attaché Ms. Reichelle V. Corpuz received the awards for the country while Secretary of the Department of Tourism – Philippines Berna Romulo-Puyat attended through virtual meeting.

Macro to Micro Impact in Tourism

MICE is one of the growing sectors in ASEAN Countries. With the ASEAN MICE Venue Standards (AMVS) certified MICE venues like Clark Marriott Hotel will aim to remain competitive and cooperative in providing quality MICE venues to the visitors making ASEAN a competitive MICE region.

“This recognition of our local cities and hotels and MICE venues not only serves as a testament to the Philippines’ commitment to uphold the best tourism standards it also mirrors the strong Bayanihan spirit we have exhibited to overcome this crisis” Puyat said.

The Tourism’s Region 3 Office headed by Regional Director Carol Uy is one with this achievement as it signifies the region’s continuous preparedness to accommodate guests and tourists despite the pandemic.

Clark Marriott Hotel among other properties given this prestigious international recognition will be further promoted and prioritized in various platforms of DOT and ASEAN. Likewise DOT will continuously update and monitor the performance of these venues to ensure that they maintain their quality and standard as specified in AMVS."

Credit cards are one way for people to boost their credit score with their everyday purchases. However qualifying for a credit card often requires a good credit score so it can be difficult to start building your credit. However fintech companies have been working on innovative solutions to help build your credit score outside of traditional methods. Extra Card has created a debit card that allows people build credit without a credit check or a high credit score to qualify. Below Select looks at how Extra Card works and the different features it offers.

How can Extra be a debit card that improves your credit score?

Extra was founded by Max Hellerstein Cyrus Summerlin and Biren Shah in 2020. Extra works kind of like a charge card. With a charge card cardholders are unable to carry a balance from month-to-month and are required to pay their balances off in full after an interval of time usually every 30 days. With Extra cardholders make a purchase and Extra pays off the merchant at the time of transaction. However Extra connects to your checking account so one day after you make a purchase Extra takes the money from your bank account for that transaction. At the end of the month Extra then reports your card transactions to the credit bureaus Equifax and Experian. Extra does not currently report to Transunion. Extra is in communication with Transunion about its information being added to Transunion's credit reporting says Max Hellerstein Co-Founder and CEO of Extra Card. By reporting cardholder's payments to Equifax and Experian the Extra Card can have a positive impact on your credit score as reported by those two bureaus.

Extra Card (Rewards + Credit Building) Rewards Up to 1% rewards points on all purchases

Welcome bonus None

Annual fee $25 a month or $199 upfront for the year.

Foreign transaction fee N/A — cannot be used internationally

Credit needed None Pros Does not require a security deposit like other credit cards for building credit

No credit check or minimum credit score required Cons Costs $199 annually

Only reports to two credit bureaus Equifax and Experian View More

Using an Extra Card can impact your credit utilization ratio too. The credit utilization ratio is the ratio of credit you're using to the total amount of credit you've been extended. Your credit utilization ratio impacts the 'amount owed' category of your FICO score. The 'amount owed' category comprises 30% of your credit score. Experts recommend keeping your credit utilization ratio under 30% or even 10% if you can. Since the card is paid off daily your credit utilization ratio will reset each day says Hellerstein. When your credit utilization ratio is reset frequently you're more likely to have a low utilization ratio. Having a low utilization ratio also has a positive impact on your credit score. The Extra Card charges no APR or interest because you have to pay off your balance daily. And unlike a credit card Extra won't let you spend more than you have in your bank account so you won't have to worry about overspending and potentially going into debt. In order to qualify for an Extra Card you don't need a credit score either. Extra doesn't perform credit checks but potential cardholders must meet these requirements: Applicants must be 18 years of age or older

You must have an SSN or ITIN number

Applicants must have a US address where you can receive your Extra Card (P.O. boxes are not valid)

Have a checking account at one of 10000 select U.S. banks

Have an iOS device (iPhone or iPad) or an Android device running version 10 or later According to Hellerstein 99% of applicants are approved for the card because all transactions on the card are backed by cash. When cardholders sign up for Extra they are given a spending limit based on the real-time balance of the bank account they choose to connect says Hellerstein.

Fees and rewards

Extra charges either an annual or monthly fee for cardholders. For Extra Credit Building you'll pay $8 a month but if you're willing to pay for the entire year upfront you'll get a slight discount and pay $84. For Extra Credit Building and Rewards you'll pay $12 a month or $108 for the entire year. For the higher price you'll gain access to the Extra Rewards program. Cardholders will earn 5 rewards points for every $1 they spend. Five rewards points are worth up to 1 cent so the redemption value is a only 0.2 cents per point. Essentially you're getting 1% back on all purchases if you redeem your points for max value. Extra has a rewards store available through the Extra App but the offerings in the store vary. According to Hellerstein recent popular items in the store include an electric toothbrush card games gift cards and AirPods. Since Extra is a debit card focused on building credit it's unsurprising that it offers few rewards and little flexibility in how cardholders can redeem their points. The Extra Card cannot be used internationally so there is no foreign transaction fee.

Alternatives to the Extra Card

Extra's fees can be quite a hefty price to pay for trying to raise your credit score. You might consider alternatives like a secured credit card which requires that you put down a deposit that acts as collateral if you don't pay your bills. Typically your credit line is equal to the amount of your deposit. Secured cards are much easier to be approved for if you have bad or no credit. When Select analyzed various secured cards to determine which cards were the best for people with no credit or bad credit and who wanted to improve their scores it ranked the Discover it® Secured Credit Card as the winner. With the Discover it® Secured Credit Card cardholders only need to put down a minimum $200 deposit for a credit line equal to that amount. Starting seven months after account opening Discover will evaluate your credit card account to determine if you can transition to an unsecured line of credit. If you don't want to put down a deposit you might consider the Petal® 1 ""No Annual Fee"" Visa® Credit Card which is catered to people with non-prime credit looking to improve their scores.

Petal® 1 ""No Annual Fee"" Visa® Credit Card Learn More Rewards 2% to 10% cash back at select merchants

Welcome bonus None

Annual fee $0

Intro APR N/A

Regular APR 25.24% - 34.74% variable

Balance transfer fee N/A

Foreign transaction fee None

Credit needed Fair/No Credit Terms apply.

The Petal 1 Card has no annual fee no welcome bonus and earns between 2% - 10% cash back at select merchants. With the Petal 1 Card you'll have to make your monthly payments each month in full or risk having to pay interest. Unlike the Extra card the Petal 1 Card reports to all three credit bureaus has no annual fee or foreign transaction fee (unlike Extra the Petal 1 can be used abroad). Additionally unlike the Extra Card the Petal 1 Card is a credit card so you'll have an entire month to pay off your bill.

Bottom line

The Extra Card can be a useful tool for people who aren't eligible for most credit cards but are looking to boost their credit scores. However the card does have an $8 monthly fee or an $84 annual fee so you might be better off getting a secured credit card with no annual fee in order to build your credit. Secured cards will require a security deposit but you'll typically receive the deposit back and will be eligible for an unsecured card after making your payments on time and in full for a few months. Extra Card also has downsides: Your card history is not reported to all three credit bureaus and it can't be used in foreign countries.

Welcome back to the Metaverse Explorer series with me Jake.

If you enjoy sports tennis and video games I got the perfect spot for you. The Australian Open one of the largest tennis tournaments in the world rented out over 100 parcels in Decentraland located here. The scene is huge and features a tennis arena wearables shop beach house and ball park area. The Australian Open complex is the largest location I have explored to date and features a plethora of activities to keep the citizens of Decentraland entertained.

The Rod Laver Arena located in the center of the complex is a digital replica of the physical arena. The scene has blue panels wrapped around the structure with a white roof. The blue panels reflect like solar panels and the detailed white railing gives it a realistic touch. Brown pillars appear to hold the structure up towards the back of the build.

There are tables umbrellas and chains in the far right corner for viewing. The inside of the area is a tennis game. Hit the tennis balls across the court in 7 different locations to receive the prize. The location is advertised like the real event with Rolex Polo Emirates and Mastercard. The inside is primarily an ocean-blue color from the seats to the court.

The AO shop is a clothing store located across the street from the arena. The outside features glass walls with clear views of the interior. Similar to the arena the structure’s primary colors are blue and white. The inside has several wearable displays and benches with a checkout counter towards the front. A large Mastercard advertisement greets visitors on the wall right behind the entrance doors.

The Beach House is a cool outdoor club adjacent to the Rod Laver arena. There is a large screen with lawn chairs and umbrellas. There are VIP lounges bordering the location with sectioned off couches and tables. There is a bar for drinks and a full volleyball court with a net sand and play boundaries.

The BallPark is a large picnic area featuring TVs food trucks tables chairs and a ferris wheel. The BallPark is a colorful spot containing blues greens yellows and orange. The ferris wheel is a unique touch and can be used to view the entire complex. There is a large viewing area for avatars to mingle and watch the matches. There is even a rock wall towards the entrance which can be climbed by your avatar.

I love everything about this experience from the Australian Open partnership to all the structures. They keep it interesting by integrating games interactive elements and social experiences throughout the complex. The Australian Open has pioneered a large sporting event in the metaverse and I look forward to other large leagues adopting the same type of experience.

iciHaiti - BNC : Renovated website and new debit card (PM intervention)





Prime Minister Ariel Henry participated this week in the launching ceremony of the revamped Banque Nationale de Crédit (BNC) website https://www.bnconline.com and the launch of their new debit card.



In his speech Ariel Henry said ""I extend my congratulations to the BNC team for the continuity of the efforts to modernize this state institution [...]



With the digitization of its data the BNC is at the heart of the Information and Communication Technologies revolution. A completely modernized State bank that can easily compete with other international banks.



The BNC has now become a management model for the Haitian public sector in a competitive and constantly changing environment.



The BNC will have to respond effectively to its mission which is to open up more to certain categories of people in particular small stock exchanges and small commerçants. As a financial institution it must encourage investment.



The BNC must also put itself more at the service of our brothers and sisters in the diaspora so that they are able to open an account in any country. Especially since the BNC's Mastercard reference card works around the world.""

The increasing number of users subscribing

The majority of online dating sites operate on a freemium model which allows users to register for free and use the service until they decide to pay for the additional perks of the subscription model. With an increasing percentage of users' choice for the subscription model businesses are not sharing all of their goods with free consumers. As a result freemium users have an incredibly low chance of finding a match prompting them to switch to a subscription model. The vendor is attracted by the thought of tweaking the pairing algorithm which would enable more people to subscribe to their services.

Host Cameroon became the first semifinalist after knocking off Gambia with relative ease 2-0. Karl Toko Ekambi scored both goals in a dominant performance by the Indomitable Lions which are looking every bit the part of AFCON 2022 winners. But Cameroon will face its toughest test yet in the semis: Mohamed Salah and Egypt are in the final four after handling Morocco in extra time 2-1 thanks to a goal and assist by Salah.

After upsetting Nigeria in the Round of 16 Tunisia was upset itself by Burkina Faso 1-0 in the quarters on Saturday. For Burkina Faso it's a return to the semis after finishing third in the 2017 AFCON. It will meet pre-tournament favorite Senegal which beat Equatorial Guinea 3-1 in convincing fashion.

Masood Rizwan and Kushdil star in record chase

Shan Masood (83) and Mohammad Rizwan (69) starred in the highest successful chase in the PSL history as Multan Sultans overhauled Lahore Qalandars' 206 with two balls and five wickets to spare to make it two in two at the National Stadium in Karachi on Saturday (January 29).

Chasing a stiff target the Sultans were off to a dream start with both the openers notching up brisk fifties. The pair went on to post a 150-run opening stand to keep their side always ahead of the asking rate and lay the ideal platform. They scored 66 in the powerplay and Masood quickly went on to outscore his partner to bring up a 28-ball fifty at the start of the ninth over and by the end of it Sultans had already breached the 100-run mark. Rizwan raised his second successive fifty off 28 deliveries.

While Rashid Khan was the only one able to restrict the flow of runs in his overs he didn't quite get the same support from the other end. After giving just 16 from his first-three overs though Rashid came in the firing line as Masood slammed one over the cow corner to bring up the 150 of the partnership. However it was the Afghanistan spinner who got his team the much needed breakthrough as he made a strong comeback off the very next delivery to fox the Sultans opener with a wrong'un.

By the time Rashid wrapped up his quota the equation was already down to 51 off 30 but it didn't help losing Rizwan in quick succession. Qalandars saw a glimmer of hope when their skipper Shaheen Afridi - having leaked 39 for 1 in his first three - came back to bowl an excellent 19th over where he conceded only one run and accounted for big hitters Tim David and Sohaib Maqsood one ball apart.

However Haris Rauf struggled to nail his yorkers in the final overs and Khushdil Shah took full toll. With 16 needed off the last six he dispatched the first three back over the bowler's head through extra cover and through point respectively to fetch three boundaries before polishing off the record chase with a six in a stunning cameo of 18 off just four.

Earlier in the day it was Fakhar Zaman's brutal assault that laid the platform for Qalandars' 200-plus total - the first of the season. Zaman launched a flurry of boundaries in his 35-ball 76 getting to his fifty in just 22. He was the aggressor in the 89-run opening stand with Abdullah Sshafique who made a 22-ball 24 before falling in the ninth over.

Zaman fell soon after having hit 11 fours and a couple of sixes but even as Kamran Ghulam kept the runs coming from one end Sultans managed to apply the brakes. It was courtesy David Wiese and Rashid - who both smashed two sixes apiece in the last two overs - that Qalandars succeeded in posting 206/5 for their allotted overs.

Brief scores: Lahore Qalandars 206 for 5 in 20 overs (Fakhar Zaman 76 Kamran Ghulam 43; Khushdil Shah 1-14) lost to Multan Sultans 209 for 5 in 19.4 overs (Shan Masood 83 Mohammad Rizwan 69; Shaheen Afridi 3-40 Rashid Khan 1-28) by 5 wickets.

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

The SNP said it does not comment on such matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L2NvdWxkLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWZvdXJ0aC1yb3VuZC1pb2wtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWZpbmQtaGlzLXdheS10by10aGUtc3RhcnRpbmctbGluZXVwLWluLTIwMjQtbmZs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

'What the spoon is really for… to MIX!!'

'If you didn't know now you do' she captioned the video which has since racked up more than 4.4million views.

Many TikTok users were left mind blown after watching the short video.

'I know for a fact EVERY SINGLE PERSON who has had a McFlurry for the first time has tried to drink it out if the spoon' one person wrote.

'Today years old. Who else?' another added.

But some complained saying despite the purpose some McFlurry's are often served without being mixed.

'If you're from Australia we got rid of the machines years ago so that's why it doesn't get mixed here' one TikToker claimed.

'If the spoon is for mixing why don't [you] ever mix it?' another wrote.

'They don't do this in the UK' a third added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoZWZpbmRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9tY2RvbmFsZHMtc3BpY2llci1jaGFuZ2UtY2hpY2tlbi1udWdnZXRzLWphcGFuL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoZWZpbmRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9tY2RvbmFsZHMtc3BpY2llci1jaGFuZ2UtY2hpY2tlbi1udWdnZXRzLWphcGFuL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald’s Just Announced A Major Change To Their Chicken Nuggets—All We Can Say Is Wow!,"McDonalds is spicing up their nugget options in Japan and as Eat This Not That writes the U.S. could be next. The American fast food chain is reportedly now offering limited-time “Peppercorn Garlic Spicy Chicken McNuggets” with two new sauces— the garlic soy sauce mayo and the smoked cheese— now debuting in Japan.

This latest nugget experiment and new releases come after Americans showed their desire for spicier nuggets or options with more flavor. As you might remember in 2020 McDonald’s debuted a very successful limited-time “Spicy Chicken McNugget” menu item in the U.S. and the nuggets sold out nationwide within a month.

A recent Change.org petition “Bring Back McDonald’s Spicy Nuggets for good” was started and users continue to sign and comment hoping to bring their favorite food back to McDonald’s restaurants.

The brand new nugget options in Japan offer American McDonald’s frequenters hope in that the chain can offer spicier nuggets in the future. The “Peppercorn Garlic” nuggets there are made with a mix of coarse-ground black pepper garlic white pepper and chili peppers. The two new sauces—the mayo and the smoked cheese— are seasoned with a mixture of black pepper and onion powder.

The pooled results from these studies showed the following in favor of the RDN and PVI treated group in comparison to PVI alone: (1) A significant reduction in the risk of AF recurrence at follow-up; (2) a significant reduction in SBP at 12-month follow-up; (3) a significant increase in eGFR at 6-month follow-up; (4) a low overall rate of complications in both groups both during the procedures and during the follow-up period.

Currently the main treatment for HTN is often a combination of lifestyle and drug therapy. First-line agents according to the latest American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers [23]. While various drug combinations doses and additional agents can be used to reach blood pressure targets HTN remains the main risk factor for cardiovascular disease including AF and premature death worldwide [24]. Thus there is a complex pathophysiological mechanism underlying chronic HTN that goes beyond first-line agents addressing the sodium/volume components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

Studies suggest that HTN can also have neurogenic roots as sympathetic nervous system (SNS) tone is higher in hypertensive patients as opposed to non-hypertensive patients [25]. Increased activity particularly in the efferent renal nerves leads to increased stimulation in both renal alpha and beta-adrenoceptors [26]. Stimulation of beta-adrenoreceptors of the juxtaglomerular apparatus increases renin secretion which ultimately leads to increased systemic vascular resistance and thus arterial pressure [26]. Likewise increased SNS tone has also been shown to reduce eGFR through the effects of alpha-adrenoceptors on the afferent arterioles [26]. Kidney damage such as due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or drug-resistant/uncontrolled HTN has been shown to be a driver of increased SNS tone seen in neurogenic HTN [27].

RDN proposes ablation of the renal efferent and afferent nerves to interrupt the communication between the kidney and the autonomic nervous system and thus reduce blood pressure. SYMPLICITY HTN-3 the first of its kind was a prospective blinded sham-controlled trial that included 367 patients and aimed to investigate the effect of RDN on HTN [28]. The trial failed to show any significant blood pressure lowering effects after ablation of the renal nerves [28]. However it was found that there were many confounders that led to the null effect of SYMPLICITY HTN-3 such as adherence antihypertensive medications improper procedural methods and a lack of operator experience [29]. These among others were addressed in recent trials leading to significant blood pressure lowering effects of RDN seen in the SPYRAL HTN-ON/OFF MED and RADIANCE-HTN SOLO trials [303132]. These benefits of RDN were reiterated in a recent meta-analysis of 12 trials (n = 1539) and showed that catheter-based RDN is not only effective in the reduction of office blood pressure compared to sham or antihypertensive therapy alone but is also safe for patients [33]. Initially it was thought that RDN would be most efficacious in patients with drug-resistant HTN but the lessons learned from SYMPLICITY HTN-3 and later trials suggested superior responses of RDN in patient with moderate and neurogenic HTN. Therefore the ideal candidate for RDN is yet to be identified.

With recent trials supporting the revival of RDN further findings have also emphasised the potential of its therapeutic uses beyond blood pressure lowering in HTN into AF treatment where HTN is an established risk factor. One of which is seen in a recent post-hoc study of 226 patients from SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED where RDN lowered renin and aldosterone during the follow-up period [34]. For the first time in a human model the findings of this study established the interaction between RDN renal sympathetic tone and HTN [34]. Indeed the improved catheter technology as well as the increase in the sites and frequency of ablation within the renal vasculature has facilitated the utility of RDN beyond just treating HTN [29]. The use of RDN to treat AF can be further supported by various epidemiological studies one of which (n = 1332) significantly showed that a reduction in SBP into lower hypertensive categories reduced the odds of AF recurrence [35]. The present study demonstrated through a pooled analysis of literature that in hypertensive patients with AF when treated with either PVI alone or a combination of PVI and RDN that the combined treatment group showed a significant mean reduction of SBP by 9.42 mm Hg (p = 0.05) and a reduction of DBP by 4.11 mm Hg (p = 0.16) at follow-up.

The pathophysiological link between HTN and AF is unclear. However a review proposed that the link mainly stems from the structural changes associated with HTN such as LV hypertrophy and LV systolic/diastolic dysfunction which subsequently lead to an increase in left-atrial pressure and fibrosis [36]. Simultaneously the activation of RAAS further exacerbates those structural modifications and hence leads to electrical remodeling and AF [36]. This hypothesis was evident in our review where the ablation of the renal nerves and hence the reduction in sympathetic activation and consequently in RAAS activity significantly reduced the recurrence of AF by more than 20% (compared to PVI and drug therapy alone) which outlines the involvement of RAAS and HTN in AF development and/or recurrence. Additionally in one of the studies included in this review subgroup-analysis of AF recurrence in moderate vs severe resistant hypertensive patients was conducted [17]. Results revealed that in moderate resistant HTN the average blood pressure reduction was −12.5/7.8 mm Hg following RDN and that the rate of AF recurrence was not significantly different between the groups [17]. However in the severe resistant HTN group average blood pressure reduction was −29.1/12.2 mm Hg and AF recurrence was significantly lower in the RDN group [17]. In a study by Grassi et al. it was demonstrated that there was a strong positive correlation between sympathetic activity and blood pressure [37]. The study revealed that control subjects had the lowest muscle sympathetic nerve activity compared to those with severe HTN [37]. This suggests that the greater reduction in blood pressure shown in the study by Pokushalov et al. might lead to either a stronger decrease in sympathetic activity or a decrease in sympathetic vascular tone or both which might have therefore led to the superiority of the decrease in the rate of AF in the severe resistant HTN group [17].

Uncontrolled HTN has been implicated in the development of kidney disease with an average yearly decrease in eGFR of 0.5–2.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 [383940]. The activation of the SNS and RAAS have been identified as the main contributors in the development and progression of renal disease [41]. Therefore it is clear that AF HTN and CKD are interlinked and share multiple underlying pathophysiological processes. Interestingly in one of the included studies in this review it was noted that patients with CKD had an increased left-atrial volume compared to those without CKD which therefore contributes strongly to the development of AF [19]. Owing to the hyperactivation of renal sympathetics and RAAS in patients with CKD the addition of RDN to PVI yielded a stronger decrease in AF recurrence as well as an improvement of multiple structural cardiac parameters including left-atrial volume LVEF left-ventricular mass index and left-ventricular end-diastolic diameter [19].

The treatment efforts to dampen RAAS clinically such as with pharmacological therapy have failed to yield significant improvements in eGFR and CKD [41]. The progression demonstrated by RDN has led to multiple investigations on the topic and a recent meta-analysis of 11 non-randomized studies was conducted looking at the effect of RDN in hypertensive patients with CKD [42]. The study mainly concluded that RDN was superior in reducing blood pressure and had no increase in the rate of decline in renal function in patients with CKD. Drawing upon the connection between AF HTN and CKD three of the included trials in this review sought to explore the effect of RDN on eGFR and CKD in an attempt to elucidate the interplay between the outlined mechanisms [181920]. The pooled analysis showed that RDN significantly improved eGFR compared to PVI alone (MD = 10.2; p < 0.001). This may be explained in part by the reduction in sympathetic overdrive following RDN. Kiuchi et al. further noted that more rigorous methods of assessment of renal function should be used in future studies to clearly elucidate the effect of RDN on renal function and CKD [19].

Regarding the safety of RDN a recent meta-analysis assessing renal function as a safety parameter included 52 quantitative and 14 qualitative studies and concluded that no adverse effects were present following treatment with RDN deeming it as a safe method for use in treatment of HTN [43].

Clinical implications

The present study in addition to the aforementioned evidence outlines the critical interplay between HTN AF and kidney disease and given the high rate of AF recurrence following PVI alone the development and consideration of incorporating RDN in addition to current therapeutic strategies to treat both HTN and AF is clinically justified. The pooled analysis further revealed that the use of RDN led to a significant increase in eGFR and hence supported the clinical application of this technology in the context of kidney disease.

Our study supplemented the extensive body of literature on the topic that proved that both procedural and follow-up complications of RDN are low and that the technology has proven to be safe and efficacious with an overall complication rate of 6.32%.

Limitations

Although multiple reviews have been published on the topic they failed to account for patients that were concurrently included in multiple studies within the analysis and have therefore duplicated patients [22 44454647]. In the 2014 trial by Pokushalov et al. it was stated that the cohort included the 27 patients from the 2012 trial (pilot study) [10 17]. Furthermore a trial published in 2017 by Romanov et al. involved the same cohort of patients from the previous 2014 trial by Pokushalov et al. but isolated patients that had cardiac monitor implantation [48]. Indeed all previously published reviews contain either Pokushalov et al. 2012 and/or 2014 and/or Romanov et al. 2017 and thus incorporate duplicated patients and run the risk of misrepresentation of the data and lack robustness in the true assessment of the impact of RDN on AF and HTN. To this end this is the first review reporting on the topic with a total of 711 patients as well as including the most recent data following the incorporation of the trials by Turagam et al. [22]. Moreover our review was the first review on the topic to pool and meta-analyze the effect of RDN on eGFR in patients with HTN and AF.

This review has common limitations to all reviews/analyses as well as specific limitations pertaining to the included studies. Hence the findings presented are based on the quality of the included studies. Although all studies were prospective two of those were non-randomized [18 19]. Furthermore the reliability of the reported results depends on the consistency in inclusion criteria and the methods employed by the studies including baseline characteristics underlying comorbidities definition of HTN (i.e. HTN cut-off values) and AF number of antihypertensive and anti-arrhythmic drugs catheterization and ablation methods differences in follow-up times as well as methods to assess the outcomes during follow-up; all of which may have varied between the studies and hence might have affected the reliability and introduced heterogeneity in our results. The heterogeneity was combatted by conducting a sensitivity analysis. Finally it is also worth noting that one of the included trials (HFIB-1) was terminated early due to an increase in renovascular complications which may be owing to the use of a non-FDA approved catheter and hence caution should be exercised when assessing pooled outcomes that included the mentioned study [22].",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzJjNDdhYWJhLTI5ZTMtNGY2YS1iMWVmLTYwMzdmYTY4NTEzZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robots give surgeons a helping hand,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ft.com', port=443): Read timed out.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

When Facebook renamed itself Meta late last year it heralded a pivot towards the “metaverse” – where virtual influencers will presumably one day roam in their thousands.

Even Meta admits the metaverse doesn’t really exist yet. The building blocks of a persistent immersive virtual reality for everything from business to play are yet to be fully assembled. But virtual influencers are already online and are surprisingly convincing.

But given its recent history is Meta (née Facebook) really the right company to be setting the ethical standards for virtual influencers and the metaverse more broadly?

Who (or what) are virtual influencers?

Meta’s announcement notes the “rising phenomenon” of synthetic media – an umbrella term for images video voice or text generated by computerised technology typically using artificial intelligence (AI) or automation.

Many virtual influencers incorporate elements of synthetic media in their design ranging from completely digitally rendered bodies to human models that are digitally masked with characters’ facial features.

At both ends of the scale this process still relies heavily on human labour and input from art direction for photo shoots to writing captions for social media. Like Meta’s vision of the metaverse influencers that are entirely generated and powered by AI are a largely futuristic fantasy.

But even in their current form virtual influencers are of serious value to Meta both as attractions for their existing platforms and as avatars of the metaverse.

Interest in virtual influencers has rapidly expanded over the past five years attracting huge audiences on social media and partnerships with major brands including Audi Bose Calvin Klein Samsung and Chinese e-commerce platform TMall.

A competitive industry specialising in the production management and promotion of virtual influencers has already sprung up although it remains largely unregulated.

So far India is the only country to address virtual influencers in national advertising standards requiring brands “disclose to consumers that they are not interacting with a real human being” when posting sponsored content.

Ethical guidelines

There is an urgent need for ethical guidelines both to help producers and their brand partners navigate this new terrain and more importantly to help users understand the content they’re engaging with.

Meta has warned that “synthetic media has the potential for both good and harm” listing “representation and cultural appropriation” as specific issues of concern.

Indeed despite their short lifespan virtual influencers already have a history of overt racialisation and misrepresentation raising ethical questions for producers who create digital characters with different demographic characteristics from their own.

But it’s far from clear whether Meta’s proposed guidelines will adequately address these questions.

Becky Owen head of creator innovation and solutions at Meta Creative Shop said the planned ethical framework “will help our brand partners and VI creators explore what’s possible likely and desirable and what’s not”.

This seeming emphasis on technological possibilities and brand partners’ desires leads to an inevitable impression that Meta is once again conflating commercial potential with ethical practice.

By its own count Meta’s platforms already host more than 200 virtual influencers. But virtual influencers exist elsewhere too: they do viral dance challenges on TikTok upload vlogs to YouTube and post life updates on Sina Weibo. They appear “offline” at malls in Beijing and Singapore on 3D billboards in Tokyo and star in television commercials.

Gamekeeper or poacher?

This brings us back to the question of whether Meta is the right company to set the ground rules for this emerging space.

The company’s history is tarred by unethical behaviour from Facebook’s questionable beginnings in Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room (as depicted in The Social Network) to large-scale privacy failings demonstrated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

In February 2021 Facebook showed how far it was willing to go to defend its interests when it briefly banned all news content on Facebook in Australia to force the federal government to water down the Australian News Media Bargaining Code.

Last year also saw former Facebook executive Frances Haugen very publicly turn whistleblower sharing a trove of internal documents with journalists and politicians.

These so-called “Facebook Papers” raised numerous concerns about the company’s conduct and ethics including the revelation that Facebook’s own internal research showed Instagram can harm young people’s mental health even leading to suicide.

Today Meta is fighting US antitrust litigation that aims to restrain the company’s monopoly by potentially compelling it to sell key acquisitions including Instagram and WhatsApp.

Meanwhile Meta is scrambling to integrate its messaging service across all three apps effectively making them different interfaces for a shared back end that Meta will doubtless argue cannot feasibly be separated no matter the outcomes of the current litigation.

Given this back story Meta seems far from the ideal choice as ethical guardian of the metaverse.

The already extensive distribution of virtual influencers across platforms and markets highlights the need for ethical guidelines that go beyond the interests of one company – especially a company that stands to gain so much from the impending spectacle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWV0YS13b21hbi1jbGFpbXMtdmlydHVhbGx5LWdyb3BlZC1tZXRhdmVyc2UtaG9yaXpvbi12ZW51ZXMtMjAyMi0x0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9tZXRhLXdvbWFuLWNsYWltcy12aXJ0dWFsbHktZ3JvcGVkLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1ob3Jpem9uLXZlbnVlcy0yMDIyLTE_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta: Woman claimed male avatars virtually groped her in Horizon Venues,"Stock image of a woman using a virtual reality headset.

A woman claimed that a gang of male avatars virtually groped her in Meta's metaverse The Mail on Sunday reported.

The 43-year-old said she was also verbally harassed by the avatars in Meta's Horizon Venues.

Last month another woman said she was virtually groped while working as a beta tester for Meta's Horizon Worlds.

A 43-year-old British woman claims she was virtually groped by a gang of male avatars in Meta's metaverse earlier this month The Mail on Sunday first reported.

Nina Jane Patel who works as the vice president of research for a rival metaverse said in a Medium post that she was ""verbally and sexually harassed"" by three or four male avatars in Meta's Horizon Venues.

The London-based mother said that within a minute of joining the virtual world's lobby earlier this month male avatars began harassing her.

According to Patel's Medium post the avatars touched her character's body inappropriately made sexual comments and took screenshots for several minutes.

After trying to flee the virtual world Patel told The Mail on Sunday that she had to tear off her virtual reality (VR) headset to bring an end to the ordeal. She told the paper that she has been suffering from anxiety ever since.

""We're sorry to hear this happened"" a Meta spokesperson told Insider by email. ""We want everyone in Horizon Venues to have a positive experience and easily find the safety tools that can help in a situation like this – and help us investigate and take action.""

The spokesperson noted that Patel did not use the platform's reporting tools allowing users to block mute and report anyone near them. Patel told Insider that she wasn't able to do so quickly enough.

""Horizon Venues should be safe and we are committed to building it that way"" the Meta statement continued. ""We will continue to make improvements as we learn more about how people interact in these spaces especially when it comes to helping people report things easily and reliably.""

Horizon Venues is a digital experience which Meta is still developing that allows people to use a virtual reality headset to create avatars that can watch online events together.

Last month Insider's Stephen Jones reported that another woman said a stranger also groped her on one of Meta's other digital platforms — Horizon Worlds. A Meta internal investigation concluded that the victim hadn't enabled safety features.

On Jan. 2 the Cowboys admittedly made one with Tony Pollard.

The third-year running back saw just six touches during a Week 17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals including two in the final three quarters. Pollard was far and away the team’s most explosive option in the backfield. Still in a critical game for playoff seeding coaches got away from him.

“Obviously we’ve got to get him in there more” offensive coordinator Kellen Moore said on Jan. 6. “That’s certainly fair and that’s all of us looking at it in reflection. ... We want to get Tony on the field more. We’ve got to get him more involved. That game turned into one that we didn’t do a good enough job of getting him in there.”

The Cowboys then repeated their mistake.

Pollard received six touches in his next game too this time a Jan. 16 playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers. How best to balance Ezekiel Elliott and Pollard is something on which the team has struggled to get a handle. A plan must be identified this offseason as part of a larger team study on how to improve the run game and backfield usage.

Pollard can help himself.

He has room to improve in the passing game including in protection. The fact that Elliott is the more trusted option doesn’t help Pollard’s argument for touches when the Cowboys find themselves in obvious passing situations be it third-and-long a two-minute drill before halftime or a negative game script playing from behind late in games.

Narrowing the skill gap would help coaches involve Pollard more. He averaged 5.5 yards per carry while totaling 130 carries for 719 yards and two touchdowns in 2021.

Elliott can help himself too.

That starts with getting healthy.

Elliott is certain to return next season as his $12.4 million salary for 2022 became fully guaranteed last March. Slimmer and more explosive he looked dynamic in the spring and summer and that translated into a fast start to the season.

But those gains were spoiled in Week 4 when Elliott partially tore the posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee against Carolina. The slowdown was most noticeable after the bye week. In the first six games Elliott totaled 102 carries for 521 yards (5.1 average) and five touchdowns. In the final 12 including the postseason he managed 147 carries for 512 yards (3.5) and five scores.

Elliott won’t undergo surgery this offseason presuming the knee heals as hopes. The option may be explored if the knee does not respond to rest.

Ultimately it falls on the Cowboys coaches and scouts to assess and address this run game.

Two weeks ago the 49ers demonstrated what a top-notch rushing offense looks like. Schematically their self-scout was sound. They were creative and physical creating issues before and after the snap. They understood what they do best and kept patient with it.

The explosive Pollard was one of the Cowboys’ main strengths.

He largely stood and watched.

The Chicago Illinois-based Pakistani American who is still grappling with the murders spoke to People ahead of National Gun Violence Survivors Week Feb. 1-7.

The magazine says Coffland née Khan has “dedicated her life to keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.” She told the magazine that she wants “people to understand the gun laws are not there to take the guns away from people who need to protect themselves” she says. “They’re actually there to stop the guns from getting into people’s hands like Randall.” Coffland is a claim adjuster at Metlife according to her LinkedIn profile.

According to the People report Coffland first joined Moms Demand Action in 2018 “while struggling with the gaping hole left behind by her daughters’ senseless murders.” She later became a member of Everytown for Gun Safety’s Survivor Network “speaking to other members and publicly about her harrowing ordeal” the report added. She told People that her hope is “to strengthen gun laws by extending waiting times to get a weapon particularly if the purchaser has mental health issues or is in a volatile relationship.”

Starting in February 2019 the National Gun Violence Survivors Week focuses “on highlighting the resilience of America’s gun violence survivors who despite experiencing incredible trauma is leading work on the ground to support other survivors and advocating for common-sense measures that save lives” Everytown for Gun Safety. It honors “the 58 percent of Americans who’ve reported that they’ve experienced gun violence firsthand — or that someone they care for has personally experienced gun violence.”

Randy Coffland shot the daughters in the head killing them instantly after which he pointed the gun at Anjum’s legs.

The proud mother told People that at age 16 her twin daughters Brittany and Tiffany “had their career paths already mapped out.” She said Brittany a cheerleader and gymnast wanted to work in hospitality “a natural choice for her outgoing gregarious daughter” who “made friends easily and loved life.” Her twin sister Tiffany on the other hand was “a serious student who aced her AP classes got a job at a local pet store to gain experience for a career working with animals” her mother recalled to People.

Although Coffland and her husband were still married they were legally separated and lived apart. Randall Coffland and his daughters stayed at a luxury condominium in St. Charles Anjum Coffland was living in her own apartment in a different part of St. Charles. The double murder-suicide took place inside a luxury condo complex in the Chicago suburb. The Chicago Sun-Times reported.

She told People that her estranged husband was upset that the two were separating. A month before the shooting Coffland said her husband bought the gun he used to kill the girls and himself — the first one he ever purchased. “I had no idea he bought a gun.”

The tragedy took place on March 10 2017 a few days before the twins’ 17th birthday. Randy Coffland shot the daughters in the head killing them instantly after which he pointed the gun at Anjum’s legs. She recalled him telling her that their daughters were dead and that he wanted her to “live and suffer.” He then turned the gun on himself.

9-1-1 calls released a few days after the murder revealed that Randall Coffland confessed to killing his daughters and admitted that he was going to kill himself as well. Soon after her husband’s death Anjum Coffland called the police begging for help for her two daughters. “Oh my God my husband shot my kids” the mother frantically told authorities. She was in such distress that she could not remember her own address for dispatchers.

The body of one of the girls was found on a couch while the other was shot in her bedroom police said. A 9mm handgun was found near Randall’s body but investigators are still trying to determine if he owned the gun or borrowed it from someone else. She was later transported to the Delnor Community Hospital.

A few days before the murder news reports said officers had responded to a report of domestic trouble on Feb. 9 “involving the couple at a residence in the 100 block of South Fifth Avenue the Daily Herald reported. The report indicates that nothing physical happened’ during the previous incident and no one was arrested.",,,,,,,,,

Packing a bachelor’s degree in marketing fresh from the University of Louisiana-Monroe Brandon Dardeau headed to Las Vegas and a job in the casino industry.

In those days a degree didn’t impress as much he discovered. He started at the reservation call center — earning about $10 an hour — rather than in his dream position of casino host. That he considered a “glamorous job” and the reason he moved to Vegas.

Now 45 Dardeau never actually became a casino host in the 20 years he’s spent entirely with MGM Resorts International.

He did become the supervisor of casino hosts among many other positions he’s held on his way up to being named the new president and chief operating officer of Southeast Operations at Beau Rivage Resort & Casino in Biloxi and Gold Strike Casino Resort in Tunica.

It won’t take him any time to get familiar with the resorts and the employees. He’s already worked in several capacities at both properties most recently as general manager and senior vice president of marketing and operations at Gold Strike.

He dines at the restaurants and stays overnight occasionally with his family he said to experience the Beau Rivage through guests’ eyes.

And when he holds the door for VIPs checking into the Beau Rivage or picks up a broken object at the front entrance and carries it to the trash it is without anyone knowing he is the person now running the resort.

CHANGES COMING

Among the first thing on his “to do” list at the Beau Rivage is investing millions of dollars to remodel all the hotel rooms redesign Jia restaurant expand the cafe and introduce a new theme section for fans of the Buffalo slot machines.

The improvements started two years ago with the remodel of the suites at the Beau Rivage. That refresh was intended to move quickly into the hotel rooms but COVID hit and everything changed Dardeau said.

The new timetable is for work to begin in April and to have all the hotel rooms remodeled by November he said along with new carpeting lights and wall coverings in the hallways.

Guests will sleep on the same mattresses in the rooms at MGM’s famed Bellagio casino resort in Las Vegas. They will be able to check in set the thermostat and open their hotel room door on their smart phone if they choose.

The guest room makeovers are being designed by MGM Resort International’s own interior design group Dardeau said. The decor is specific to Biloxi using a collection of sand turquoise and other soft beach and sunset colors.

“It has a Southern flair just as the suites” he said so guests feel like they are on the Gulf Coast.

Jia restaurant at the Beau Rivage has been “re-imagined” he said with new furniture and lighting the last touches still to come. Now the Asian restaurant is open to the casino floor and is next to the relocated Baccarat pit. A noodle bar was created in the remodel and Vietnamese dishes were added to the menu.

Terrace Cafe just inside the front entrance and adjacent to the buffet is getting more space and a new identity.

“The demands for the buffets are not what they were pre-COVID” Dardeau said. With nearly 700 seats for the buffet the section in the atrium will be absorbed into the full-service restaurant that will be named Atrium Cafe.

At the far end of the buffet a private dining room is being converted into a themed Buffalo room filled with the popular Buffalo slot machines.

A SOUTHERN EXPERIENCE

Other changes are coming at Beau Rivage Dardeau said. Like all MGM properties the Biloxi casino will join the conversion of M Life players rewards system to MGM Rewards on Feb 1. Dardeau said the new card will give customers points for non-casino activities like hotel stays and meals.

Entertainment is back he said even if not all the national acts have resumed touring because of the coronavirus. Big & Rich are scheduled in February at the Beau Rivage and Celtic Woman in April.

While entertainment is a big part of the Beau Rivage business he said it’s not limited to headliners.

“Really everything we do is entertainment” he said on the stage the casino floor and in the shops and restaurants.

Beau Rivage is the biggest of the 12 casinos on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and with 1792 rooms to fill the drive-in customers aren’t enough.

They tap into the database of MGM Resorts’ properties in Las Vegas Atlantic City Detroit and their other casino markets across the country he said to find players eager to try their luck in Biloxi.

“Our company still needs to bring people in from other areas” he said. Sun Country Airlines flies people from 85 cities to the Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport and the Beau Rivage with three flights a week just from St. Petersburg Florida he said.

Many of these people never visited the Mississippi Gulf Coast he said and they are welcomed with warm weather glimpses of dolphins from their hotel room and the Southern hospitality for which the resort is known.

“Our service scores are the highest in the company” he said.

GOING TO WORK

Dardeau said that once he transferred from Las Vegas to Biloxi every year or two he was given more responsibility. Where he really stood out is when he helped grow the charter flights.

Living in Las Vegas at the start of his career Dardeau said he spent himself broke and decided to return to the South. He grew up in tiny Pine Prairie Louisiana north of Lafayette population about 792.

In July 2001 just two years after the Beau Rivage opened he was able to transfer within MGM Resort to Biloxi.

Casinos have so many different jobs that employees can relocate to a different area if they want to he said or change from food and beverage and try working the golf course or operations without losing seniority.

From that first job at the call center Dardeau said he started as slot assistant shift manager when he arrived in Biloxi making more than $10

“Those days we had coins and cashier” he said and he got to live the evolution to ticket in/ticket out. He enjoyed working operations but switched to marketing “Then manager of casino hosts” he said and managing the call center.

One of his most-important goals Dardeau said is to let people know about the opportunities in the casino industry like he has experienced.

“We don’t just offer jobs we offer careers” he said. Ten percent of the staff at the Beau Rivage has worked there since the first year and almost half have been there more than five years.

In the Bengals’ previous two Super Bowl trips they lost to Joe Montana’s San Francisco 49ers.

Cincinnati will have its own Joe Cool in Super Bowl LVI against the Rams in second-year quarterback Joe Burrow who will try to engineer the Bengals’ third straight playoff upset over Los Angeles.

The Rams are consensus 4-point favorites over Cincinnati at Las Vegas sportsbooks in the NFL championship game scheduled for Feb. 13 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood California. The consensus total is 49½.

The SuperBook Circa Sports and Caesars Sportsbook opened the Rams -3½ before quickly moving to -4. Caesars took a $180000 bet to win $100000 on LA on the money line (-180) within minutes of the line going up.

The Rams are playing in their second Super Bowl in four years after losing 13-3 to the Patriots in Super Bowl LIII in 2019.

“The biggest factor is the Rams have been there recently. Sean McVay has been there before” Caesars vice president of trading Craig Mucklow said. “They are all-in this year as they proved by the trades that they made. Although we wrote off Joe Burrow against the Chiefs we are not going to write him off again because that kid is unfazed by anything that happens.

“But the Rams’ experience and their defense puts the line at 4.”

BetMGM is the only book still at -3½ though MGM Resorts director of trading Jeff Stoneback said the early action was on the Rams.

Matchup doesn’t matter

Sportsbook executives expect the matchup to approach the Nevada record wagering handle of $158.6 million set in the Eagles’ 41-33 upset win over New England in Super Bowl LII in 2018.

Last year’s handle of $136.1 million was intercepted by COVID-19 restrictions.

“Some people have asked me ‘Does the matchup matter?’” Westgate SuperBook vice president Jay Kornegay said. “No. The Super Bowl sells itself. It doesn’t matter who’s in the game. We’re going to get a tremendous amount of action on it.”

“A lot of operators reported record handles in 2021 and I wouldn’t be surprised if that continues for the Super Bowl and we get close to a record handle.”

Home-field edge?

LA is the second team in NFL history to play a Super Bowl in its home stadium after the Buccaneers beat the Chiefs 31-9 in last year’s title game at Tampa Bay.

“There’s a slight advantage to that when you get to sleep in your own bed and eat the food you’re used to eating and you’re familiar with your surroundings” Kornegay said.

‘Reason to believe’

A Bengals fan bet $13000 to win $455000 at Caesars on Cincinnati to win the Super Bowl at 35-1 odds on Oct. 28.

“He actually told us he ‘needed a reason to believe’” Mucklow said.

It was hard to believe the Bengals who were as high as 200-1 long shots this season to win the Super Bowl would beat the Chiefs on Sunday when they trailed 21-3 in the first half of the AFC title game at Kansas City.

But Cincinnati which was as high as 18-1 on the in-play money line at Circa held the high-powered Chiefs to three points in the second half and overtime en route to a 27-24 overtime win as 7-point underdogs. It matched the largest comeback in conference championship game history.

Books win again

The game also stayed under the total of 54½ as sportsbooks won big on the game and the day.

“Overall it was a really good day” Red Rock Resort sportsbook director Chuck Esposito said. “The first game was really the key having Cincinnati win but really keeping that game under was the big piece for us.”

The Rams overcame a 17-7 fourth-quarter deficit to the 49ers in their 20-17 victory over San Francisco in Sunday’s NFC championship as 3½-point favorites.

A Caesars bettor lost a $500000 bet on the 49ers on the money line (+155) while another pushed on a $540000 wager on the Rams -3 (-120).

The betting public won big on the under which closed at 45½ but lost big on San Francisco on the money line.

“We clearly did not want San Francisco to win outright” Esposito said. “Having the Rams win by 1 2 or 3 was much better than having them win by more than that.”

In what's being called the biggest economic development project in Ohio's history local state and federal leaders from President Joe Biden to Gov. Mike DeWine welcomed the company's investment to build two semiconductor plants on land in New Albany.

""This is a major win for Ohio"" DeWine said last week. ""It's really a game-changer for our economic future.""

The state disclosed the incentives it will provide to the Silicon Valley-based chip company likely will top $1 billion.

The man with the Intel:CEO Pat Gelsinger 'thrilled to be launching the Silicon Heartland in Ohio'

Investment return is jobs direct and indirect

In return Ohio will get 3000 jobs paying an average of $135000 per year. There also will be 7000 construction jobs and thousands of additional indirect jobs in the region.

""We don't see jobs like that very often"" said Jodie Perry president and CEO of Richland Area Chamber & Economic Development.

She explained how the project will benefit Richland County.

""Attracting an economic development project like this will have ripple effects"" Perry said. ""Suppliers and others that want to work with that company want to have facilities nearby. That's something we would want to position ourselves for.""

Richland County could attract supply businesses

Perry said Richland County has places where businesses could build including the greenfield sites near Mansfield Lahm Regional Airport and Ontario Commerce Park.

Investments Intel and other chip companies are making are meant to stem the global chip supply shortage that has left car lots empty and consumers struggling to buy appliances and other goods.

The new factories will enhance American resilience against disruptions in the global supply chain and inflation an issue that the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened.

Marilyn John state representative for Ohio's District 2 said the Intel plant will be big for Ohio.

""I was proud to support HB 110 the state operating budget which included the 'Mega Projects' program to help increase Ohio's competitiveness in trying to attract large economic development proposals to Ohio such as Intel"" she said. ""This Intel project will create 3000 jobs directly and provide up to $100 billion over potentially four phases to build the world's largest chip-manufacturing plant in our state.

""An additional 20000 jobs will be created in construction indirect and support jobs. Thank you to all who worked diligently to bring this opportunity to the State of Ohio.""

Tim Bowersock Mansfield's economic development director said he's not sure what effect the Intel plant will have on city residents.

""It's right on the edge of where people will want to commute"" he said.

Bowersock said studies have shown the numbers of people commuting to a job from Mansfield and the numbers coming here to work are ""pretty close.""

The plants will establish America in the global market as a massive producer of semiconductor chips which help power many digital and electronic devices and will elevate the nation’s status as a manufacturing power.

""It's good for Ohio"" Bowersock noted. ""People don't think of Ohio when it comes to that type of profession.""

Like Perry Bowersock said there are businesses in Mansfield that could be on the supply chain for a plant such as Intel.

""We do have some folks who are invested in electronics and circuit boards"" he said.

Intel will look for workers from wide area

Bowersock added there is a long way to go before the jobs will be available.

""It sounds like it will be three years before they turn the switch on"" he said. ""A lot will come out in the next 12-18 months on how to apply if you're interested.

""They're going to draw from a pretty wide area. They're not looking at only Newark to fill that work force. That's just my opinion. They're going to need a lot of higher-end people that are IT-oriented or engineering-oriented.""

Because of that officials at North Central State College and the Ohio State University-Mansfield are more than a little excited.

Jack Hershey president of the Ohio Association of Community Colleges recognized the governor and JobsOhio for helping bring Intel to the state.

""By every measure this is an historic moment for our state a game-changing success that will bring lasting benefits to every corner of Ohio"" he said in a prepared statement. ""The job opportunities generated by Intel and by other high-tech industries sure to follow will require a strong and sustainable pipeline of skilled workers ready and able to seize those opportunities.

""Preparing that work force will be an ongoing challenge requiring the very best coordinated efforts from every level of education in our state"" Hershey said. ""Ohio’s 23 community colleges are well-prepared for that challenge and eager to collaborate to help Intel and other industries of the future thrive here by developing the talent they need to succeed.”

NC State OSU-Mansfield welcome opportunities for students

Dorey Diab president of NC State sees opportunity for area business and students.

“We’re committed to working with these new businesses and the state of Ohio as an education partner to develop relevant coursework and training programs beyond the ones we already have in these high-tech areas to meet the unique needs of this new semiconductor industry segment in Ohio"" he said in a prepared statement. ""The ripples of opportunity to hire our talented graduates from this exciting development will extend throughout the state.

""The residents and businesses of north central Ohio just one hour north of the new Intel facility are in a prime location for employment living conditions and technical support.”

Diab pointed to offerings at the local college.

“NC State continues to meet the changing needs of employers throughout the region. These efforts have led to the development of new majors in cyber security bioscience plastics manufacturing communication tower technician training and the bachelor of applied science in mechanical engineering technology. Our goal is to add microchip semiconductor manufacturing support to this list"" Diab said.

Norman Jones dean of OSU-M also welcomed the opportunities Intel will bring.

Local students will have training to fill jobs

""The Ohio State University at Mansfield recognizes the importance of strong partnerships between higher education government and business and industry in our region and now we see this success at the state level"" Jones said in a prepared statement. ""This is indeed exciting for Ohio as a top magnet for a new generation of talent. The investment by Intel will also bring so many more economic development opportunities in the long-term as the ecosystem enlarges.""

Jones said OSU-M students will have the training to fill the job openings.

""Launched in 2020 and offered on the regional campuses of Ohio State the bachelor of science in engineering technology major is designed to prepare current and future students for these new careers"" he said. ""Coursework includes both mechanical and electrical engineering components as well as a focus on leadership and the latest technology in automation and networking.

""Students understand process engineering and can integrate between production supply chain and logistics. The curriculum can be tailored to meet the needs for industry related to microchip production and it was designed to prepare Ohio’s workforce to be nimble in manufacturing leadership for the future.""

Jones also noted the branch campus' collaboration with North Central State College.

""We have begun working to expand offerings in cybersecurity and IT and we have a wonderful partnership with North Central State College to ensure a rich spectrum of opportunities in higher education for the region"" he said. ""Ohio State-Mansfield is already seen as a destination campus for students from many parts of the state and this can only flourish and be strengthened with the announcement by Intel.""

The ability to trap light has been the subject of John’s research since his time as a PhD student at Harvard University. There he published his foundational papers which eventually led him to become one of the most cited scientists in the world.

Capturing light

Photonic crystals are structures made up of special electric cells that can trap light by restricting the way specific frequencies of light are propagated. According to John borrowing the concept of band gaps — ranges of energy levels that electrons cannot have in a given solid material — from the field of semiconductors helped him frame the goal of trapping light in terms of material science.

In an interview with the CBC John discussed how photonic crystals can be applied to solar cells for improved conversion of solar energy to electrical energy. Traditional solar cells are constructed from silicon which is relatively thick so that light can be absorbed better — but this requires electrons to travel longer paths to facilitate energy conversion. However John states that light can be trapped in thinner silicon which would allow for overall thinner lightweight and potentially flexible solar cells that could be ‘coated’ onto buildings vehicles and even clothing. This could be exciting news to those working in related fields such as in building integrated photovoltaics — where solar cells replace conventional materials for more cost-effective and efficient construction — and in the electric vehicle industry.

Other uses for light-trapping crystals include optical microchips and photonic-crystal fibres for noninvasive surgery. Optical microchips are similar to their electronic counterparts with the main difference being that light travels along a circuit rather than electrons.

The traditional way of restricting and guiding light is based on the concept of total internal reflection. This is used in devices such as optical fibres in telecommunication. However this phenomenon does not work well in microchips as light diffracts out of the circuit path.

This problem is bypassed with the introduction of photonic crystals which also provide other advantages such as low heat generation — which means no cooling is needed — and faster transmission of data. Photonic crystals can also be used in the construction of optical fibres for hollow-core containment of light.

A bright future

In terms of application optical microchips have been shown by John to have potential uses in medical diagnostics. Optical microchip technology is also the basis for startups such as NKT Photonics and OmniGuide: the former supplies photonic crystal fibres and the latter uses photonic crystal technology to develop minimally invasive surgical tools.

The use of photonic fibre lasers in noninvasive surgery has already been demonstrated in a case reported by John in which a patient with respiratory tract cancer had a tumour removed with a hollow-core Photonic Band-gap laser that was fitted to a flexible endoscope and inserted into the patient’s mouth.

Although research on photonic crystals and related materials has only recently taken off the topic has had a high research output based on the large number of times John’s foundational paper has been cited within the span of just a few decades. This suggests a future in which a great number of fields will experience technological advancement on a level comparable to the revolution that emerged from the development of the transistor. A bright future awaits the field of optical electronics.",,,,,,,,,

Written by Andrew Button at The Motley Fool Canada

Value investors are taking an early lead in 2022. The year is starting off with significant volatility in tech stocks which have fallen by double-digits from their level at the start of the year. At the lows the NASDAQ was down 11% for the year and nearly 20% from its November 19 high. Since then tech stocks have regained some of their momentum but they remain vulnerable to several macroeconomic developments like higher interest rates. For this reason I believe that value investors–including value-oriented tech investors–are likely to “win” in 2022.

U.S. interest rates are set to rise

One of the big advantages that value investors have in 2022 is the fact that interest rates are set to rise. There are some value stocks like utilities that get hit hard by higher interest rates but for the most part value is less sensitive to interest rates than growth is. In a conventional discounted cash flow analysis higher-growth companies lose more when rates rise than low-growth companies do. They can overcome the effect of higher interest rates by exceeding earnings expectations but in general investors tend to sell tech stocks when interest rates increase. Value stocks are less affected by the rate hikes because their present values are reduced less by them in percentage terms.

There are even some value stocks that can arguably thrive in high-rate environments. Banks like The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TSX:TD)(NYSE:TD) can pass on higher interest rates to their customers. When the central bank raises interest rates banks like TD respond by raising the interest rates they charge to customers. The end result theoretically is higher profit margins. It doesn’t always work out this way in practice. As the U.S. Federal Reserve of St. Louis points out there have been times when bank margins and interest rates moved in opposite directions. But we have evidence supporting the thesis that interest rates can be positively correlated with bank earnings sometimes. For example in its Q1 2021 earnings release Bank of America said in no uncertain terms that lower interest rates were responsible for its lower earnings in the period. TD operates in the U.S. banking sector just like BAC does so it is affected by the same macro conditions.

Tech stocks getting very expensive

Another reason why value stocks may beat growth stocks in 2022 is because some tech stocks are getting very expensive. If you look at Lightspeed POS for example it fell more than 70% after a short seller’s report shook investor confidence and an earnings release showed a widening net loss. Yet the stock still trades at 14.5 times sales which is fairly high. Bubble stocks tend to correct eventually and while the NASDAQ has dipped already this year it could dip further.

Some of the best growth is found in value stocks

Last but not least there is the fact that some of the best growth out there these days is actually found in value stocks. If you look at Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) for example it trades at just 10.5 times GAAP earnings 12.5 times adjusted earnings and 6.3 times operating cash flow. Super cheap. Yet this is a stock that grew revenue at 33% and earnings at a scorching hot 177% in its most recent quarter. If Micron can keep results like this up then its stock is very likely to see continued upside. So growth and value needn’t be at odds with one another. Very frequently they’re found together in the same stock.

But for Microsoft Teams users this could create significant problems. If an important meeting is about to start forgetting your login details could be a bad look professionally.

Moreover Microsoft Teams has become much more than a video conferencing tool. It is now employed to facilitate collaboration in many ways - an inability to gain access to the platform is sure to hinder productivity. In addition if organizations are using Teams to facilitate remote or hybrid working another problem emerges. When you're sat in yousittingome office it's not so easy torn to an IT administrator to regain access to your Teams login details.

However wherever you are working from retrieving your Teams login is nothing to stress about. We'll take you step-by-step regarding what you should do below:

Step One: Retrieve your account email

(Image credit: Microsoft)

Although this may be less likely than forgetting your password the sheer number of email accounts that some individuals possess may mean they forget which one is registered to the Teams account they need access to. If that’s the case you can use the security info associated with your Microsoft account to retrieve your Teams username.

If that doesn’t work - perhaps you didn’t set up security information in the first place - it’s a good idea to check other Microsoft products that you might be logged into. For example from a Windows 10 device you are already signed into you can access Settings followed by Accounts. Then under “Email & app accounts” you’ll be able to find the usernames connected with the device. This could be the same one you use to access Teams or if not it may at least jog your memory regarding the correct credentials.

Step Two: Attempt to login

(Image credit: Microsoft)

If you know the username or email address associated with your Teams account but have forgotten the password retrieving it follows a similar process to many other software solutions. First visit the Teams login page - whether you use the web client or a desktop app. Then when asked for your credentials select “Forgot password?”

Step Three: Verify your identity

Before Teams provide you with a new password it must verify your identity. To do so it will ask you to select a verification option. Users will be presented with two methods: Email or Text.

After selecting a verification method users will then be asked for a few extra details. For example if you set “Email” you’ll need to retype the first part of your email address while if you choose “Text” you’ll be asked for the four digits of the telephone number connected to your Teams account. Regardless of which option you selected you should receive a verification code. If you chose “Email” and haven’t received a code after a few minutes check your spam folder.

Step Four: Enter the verification code

After you've clicked ""Get Code"" Teams users will be presented with a screen asking them for their verification code. Enter the code you've received and select ""Next."" You will not be offered the chance to create a new password. Instead enter it here and you should be able to reaccess Teams.

When creating a new password it's essential to go with something that hackers won't be able to guess. Don't reuse passwords or include information like dates of birth or names of family members that might be easy to find online. If in doubt you can always use a password manager to generate a strong password that will secure your Teams access without meaning you have to remember a complex string of characters (or even worse write them down).

Step Five: Sign in

Once you’ve reset your Microsoft Teams password it’s a good idea to check your new credentials by attempting to sign in. First open Teams (or use a web browser to access the online version) and you should see the login page. Next enter your Microsoft account email address followed by your newly reset password. At this point you could tick the box that says “keep me signed in” to reduce the chances of you needing to reset your password again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvY2twYXBlcnNob3RndW4uY29tL21pY3Jvc29mdC13aWxsLWNhbmNlbC1hbmQtcmVmdW5kLWluYWN0aXZlLXhib3gtZ2FtZS1wYXNzLWFjY291bnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft will cancel and refund inactive Xbox Game Pass accounts,"Microsoft are making their auto-renewing subscriptions more flexible under pressure from the CMA the UK's Competition And Markets Authority. The regulator's investigation began in 2019 and ended this past week with the CMA saying they had ""secured undertakings"" that impact Xbox Live and Xbox Game Pass. The changes include Microsoft refunding and even cancelling subscriptions in cases where customers ""haven't used their memberships for a long time.""

Like most subscription services Microsoft regularly advertise Game Pass with a £1-a-month offer that then auto-renews at full price after three months. As access to media increasingly depends on various subscription service it's easy to sign up to an account and then forget about it.

The changes the CMA have secured include offering clearer information to customers about auto-renewal policies offering pro-rata refunds to customers who cancel during a recurring 12-month sub refunding and automatically cancelling unused accounts and better information about price increases.

Here's the full breakdwon as shared by the CMA:

Better upfront information: Microsoft will provide more transparent upfront information to help customers understand their Xbox membership – making clear for example that the subscription will auto-renew unless the customer turns off auto-renewal; when the subscription will auto-renew; how much it will cost; and how the customer can receive a refund after an accidental renewal

Refunds: Microsoft will contact existing customers on recurring 12-month contracts and give them the option to end their contract and claim a pro-rata refund

Inactive memberships: Microsoft will also contact existing customers who haven’t used their memberships for a long time but are still paying. These customers will be reminded how to stop payments and if they continue not to use their memberships Microsoft will ultimately stop taking further payments

Better information about price increases: Microsoft will give clearer notifications of any future price rises and will ensure people know how to turn off auto-renewal if they don’t want to pay the higher price

These changes are described as an ""undertaking"" which means this is a ""voluntary agreement"" on Microsoft's part to address the CMA's concerns without the need for court action.

""Other companies offering memberships and subscriptions that auto-renew should take note and review their practices to ensure they comply with consumer protection law"" said the CMA's Executive Director Of Enforcement Michael Greenfell.

While the CMA is a UK regulator and changes will roll out in the UK first a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that the improvements ""will be available globally soon.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3dvcmxkLW9mLXdhcmNyYWZ0LXN1YnNjcmlwdGlvbnMteGJveC1nYW1lLXBhc3MtbWljcm9zb2Z0LWFjdGl2aXNpb24tYWNxdWlzaXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Should Tie World of Warcraft Subscriptions With Xbox Game Pass,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3dvcmxkLW9mLXdhcmNyYWZ0LXN1YnNjcmlwdGlvbnMteGJveC1nYW1lLXBhc3MtbWljcm9zb2Z0LWFjdGl2aXNpb24tYWNxdWlzaXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbWljcm9zb2Z0L21pY3Jvc29mdC13aW5kb3dzLW5lZWRzLWF0LWxlYXN0LTgtaG91cnMtb25saW5lLXRvLXVwZGF0ZS1yZWxpYWJseS_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlcGluZ2NvbXB1dGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL21pY3Jvc29mdC9taWNyb3NvZnQtd2luZG93cy1uZWVkcy1hdC1sZWFzdC04LWhvdXJzLW9ubGluZS10by11cGRhdGUtcmVsaWFibHkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft: Windows needs at least 8 hours online to update reliably,"Microsoft says that Windows devices need to be online for at least eight hours to get the latest updates and have them correctly installed after they're released through Windows Update.

The amount of time devices running Windows are powered on and connected to Windows Update is tracked by Microsoft as 'Update Connectivity.'

This measurement correlates the systems' lack of enough connected time with why they're not up to date while also making it easier to understand why some devices are unlikely to get recently released updates successfully.

According to David Guyer a Microsoft Program Manager for Windows Updates in MEM Windows devices need at least 8 hours online to get the latest updates and successfully install them.

""One of the most impactful things we explored was how much time a device needs to be powered on and connected to Windows Update to be able to successfully install quality and feature updates"" said Guyer.

""What we found is that devices that don't meet a certain amount of connected time are very unlikely to successfully update. Specifically data shows that devices need a minimum of two continuous connected hours and six total connected hours after an update is released to reliably update.

""This allows for a successful download and background installations that are able to restart or resume once a device is active and connected.""

Guyer also said that devices should be left powered on and connected to the Internet overnight to make sure that updates get downloaded and installed properly.

Microsoft Intune Update Connectivity alerts (Microsoft)

You can track devices with insufficient Update Connectivity via Microsoft Intune by navigating to Devices > Monitor and selecting either the Feature update failures or the Windows Expedited update failures report.

Insufficient Update Connectivity alerts can also be found via the Summary report in Intune by going to Reports > Windows updates > Reports > Windows Expedited update report.

When looking at Windows 10 devices that are not fully updated and not meeting minimum connectivity requirements Microsoft saw that:

Approximately 50% of devices not on a serviced build of Windows 10 do not meet the minimum Update Connectivity measurement.

Approximately 25% of Windows 10 devices on a serviced build but have security updates that are more than 60 days out of date have less than the minimum Update Connectivity.

""When troubleshooting update issues we have found it is best to select devices that have sufficient Update Connectivity"" Guyer added.

""If a device has insufficient Update Connectivity then investigating other update issues is complicated because the low Update Connectivity can create new issues that go away once there's enough connectivity.""

In related news Microsoft began testing a smarter delivery method for Windows update improvements dubbed 'Update Stack Package' which would deliver improvements to the update experience outside of major OS updates before monthly or feature Windows updates.

The company also redesigned cumulative updates in Windows 11 to allow security and quality updates to install faster as they are approximately 40% smaller than their Windows 10 counterparts.

Last year Redmond released new APIs for managing Windows Update that enable devs and IT professionals to expedite Windows 10 security updates in enterprise environments."

MAREA is Malaysia’s first-ever Extended Producer Responsibility (ERP) association and is chaired by Nestle Malaysia CEO Juan Aranols. The association was established in January 2021 but only just recently saw its formal launch on January 21 2022.

The alliance’s members comprise of 10 well-known FMCG brands in Malaysia - Coca-Cola Colgate-Palmolive Dutch Lady Milk Industries Etika Group of Companies F&N Malaysia Mondelēz International (Malaysia) Nestlé Malaysia Spritzer Tetra Pak Malaysia and Unilever Malaysia.

Although not all of its members are from the food and beverage industry the alliance revealed during its launch that food and beverage packaging will make up over half of its Phase One focus which will include four plastic materials: PET (beverage bottles) Multi-layer laminates/flexibles (soft plastics e.g. instant noodle and biscuit packaging) Used Beverage Cartons (UBC milk and juice cartons) in addition to HDPE which is usually used for shampoo bottles.

“Although we can be fierce competitors in the market we also know that working together is necessary to address the plastic challenge that faces us [as] together we manufacture daily products for millions of consumers”​ said Aranols at the launch event.

“Estimations say that the APAC region will accumulate some 40 million tons of plastic waste by 2030 and Malaysia is expected to play a large part in this [if we continue as is] so we must do more. ​

“At present plastic still plays an important role in the food supply chain by bringing food to consumers safely – it is a necessary part of the packaging to ensure food safety especially in our warm humid climate. We are looking for alternative materials but we also need to change the way we interact with plastic towards a circular economy to reduce environmental impact.”​

Research by the World Bank Group and local ministries have shown that Malaysia produces some 1.1 million tons of plastic waste each year and a WWF report also revealed that it takes the second top spot in Asia for per capita plastic use (16.78kg) beating out larger countries such as China and Indonesia.

Ministers from the local Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) as well as the Ministry of Environment and Water (KASA) were also present to formally launch MAREA and both minister highlighted the importance of waste reduction in light of the recent flood tragedy to hit the country last December.

“It is especially important to take immediate action to mitigate the plastic waste situation especially after the recent floods – this should be taken as an eye-opener for us all towards the threat of climate change and to highlight the critical importance for Malaysia to transform towards a net zero emissions country”​ KASA Minister Dato' Sri Tuan Ibrahim Bin Tuan Man said at the event.

“This EPR is in line with Malaysia’s 2030 national sustainability goals within the Plastic Sustainability Framework 2021-2030 – one of the core strategies in that framework is the implementation of mandatory EPRs and reaching 25% plastic packaging recycling rates by 2025 – similar to MAREA’s goal.”​

Practical plans of action​

Amongst MAREA’s practical plans are to establish curbside collection systems to do weekly collections from select households in addition to promoting Separation At Source (SAS) by consumers via consumer education initiatives and working with recyclers to stabilise collection costs via subsidisation.

“The 25% of plastic waste is estimated to translate into some 20000 MT of plastic being recycled by 2025 based on our current 10 members – but we are recruiting more FMCG firms such as Danone and P&G to join us which will hopefully bump this number up even higher” ​MAREA General Manager Pauline Goh said in response to queries from FoodNavigator-Asia​ at a post-event press conference.

“Before that though our short-term goal within this year is to first recycle at least 5000 MT of plastic waste.”​

Aranols added that MAREA is an open organization not just limited to manufacturers and called for players all along the value supply chain to join them.

“We’re not just looking for big firms but also small food companies for example retailers and any other organisations along the value chain who can play a role in plastic reduction”​ he said.

Goh also said that there are plans in motion for the monetary incentivization of B40 households (Malaysians in the lowest 40% income group) to recycle but hopes to use education to get other members of the public to do this as it will be ‘more sustainable in the long run’.​

“We will also be auditing everything we do all the plastic waste that enters MAREA will be recorded – we want to establish a robust data collection and auditing system so we can prepare a proper report for both members and likely the government on a regular basis”​ she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NVIDIA GH100 to be a big and power-hungry chip

NVIDIA Hopper shaping to be a monster of a GPU.

According to the latest report from @kopite7kimi NVIDIA’s upcoming HPC accelerator called GH100 is to feature a massive die size of just slightly less than 1000mm² die. What this means is that the GPU might be up to 20% bigger than GA100 based on Ampere architecture.

Just yesterday we reported on a “Hopper” trademark dispute that NVIDIA is facing from a company using a similar name for its products. In case NVIDIA’s ongoing negotiations with the company called ‘Dish Network’ will not end in the next few weeks NVIDIA might not be able to announce its new GH100 GPU at GTC 2022 in March.

DO NOT overreact. We know the actual die size will be significantly smaller than the package size.

But GH100>GA100 is confirmed. 😁 — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) January 29 2022

Furthermore it seems that the rumors about GH100’s Multi-Chip-Module design have been wrong. Now two leakers including @kopite7kimi and @greymon55 both claim that GH100 is in fact a single-die design. However it seems that is indeed a Hopper MCM design. This chip is supposedly called GH102 GPU.

https://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1487259506723594243

The GH100 is also expected to be a very power-hungry chip. Kopite earlier reported that the TDP might even reach 1000W which would require a very efficient cooling system. The company does however already offer a water-cooled data center GPU series called HGX so that technically shouldn’t be a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Last year was a memorable year for supply chain finance (SCF) for many reasons. At the start of the pandemic in 2020 buyers began extending membership in their SCF programs to small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) a trend that continued well into 2021.

However last year’s collapse of Greensill Capital brought some unwanted attention to the little-known and opaque world of SCF.

Lex Greensill former head of SCF at Morgan Stanley founded his firm in 2011. The company lasted until March 8 2021 when it filed for insolvency due to one of its primary insurers pulling the plug on credit insurance for the firm’s debt portfolio.

Most SCF is done on a confirmed basis. But in the case of Greensill authorities alleged that the firm was providing financing against future receivables that might or might not have ever materialized which many have described as a form of unsecured lending.

In the wake of Greensill’s collapse the industry expected unwanted regulatory attention to rear its head; however a UK parliamentary report Lessons from Greensill Capital recognized no need to “bring supply chain finance within the regulatory perimeter for financial services.”

Nonetheless Greensill’s example highlights the need for greater transparency in SCF. Much information regarding SCF deals and programs is not readily available. As SCF grows and looks to attract a wider pool of investors and as it supports more-complex financing structures the need also grows for greater transparency to bring more clarity and certainty. This is particularly so for those companies that rely on SCF to ship and supply goods and services without a 60- 90- or 120-day wait for payment.

Transparency is even more critical as SCF becomes a haven for nonbanks and fintechs looking to disrupt the field by leveraging the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain and tokenization—or serving a niche such as SMEs that large global trade banks typically overlook.

Certainly Global Finance’s annual SCF awards reflect the changing mix of providers now entering the SCF market. It is tempting to be dazzled by shiny new pieces of technology and ways of doing business that many new tech-savvy entrants to the field claim they deliver. But it remains critical to keep in mind the need to balance the technology hype against other factors such as a provider’s safety and security reputation and market standing.

It is equally important not to dismiss the innovation and work some of these newer entrants bring. They may not have the track record or experience of firms that have offered SCF for decades. Still they have identified a niche that is not currently well served by the usual SCF providers and can be better addressed with newer technologies and business models.





Although long-standing SCF providers continue to invest in their offerings and want to help clients to digitalize more aspects of their supply chains there is no question that much of this innovation and investment wouldn’t be happening at its current scale or pace without the competitive threat posed by those newer tech-savvy entrants.

This year’s award winners are a mix of the old and the new and a celebration of those that bring not only financing and a pool of investors or even technology’s newest bells and whistles but also a willingness and ability to adapt their services to suit the needs of companies seeking faster and more-affordable forms of financing.

As the SCF market matures many now realize that one size does not fit all and that a wide range of solutions and approaches are needed to address the differing and varied needs of suppliers at every stage or tier of the supply chain.

Among the winners of this year’s Global Finance Best Supply Chain Finance Providers there is a growing recognition that SCF needs to benefit all parts of the supply chain. It’s no longer a special solution for only the largest suppliers in key markets according to Orbian but also provides early liquidity to suppliers in more-vulnerable countries.

Add into the mix a global pandemic that caused significant demand and supply shocks in global supply chains and cash shortfalls for companies that have had to endure months of disruption and lockdowns and we have the kind of perfect storm that allows SCF to flourish and potentially realize its full potential. Despite these recent developments there still exists the trillion-dollar trade financing gap. But a meaningful shift reflected in the achievements of this year’s winners is underway as new solutions enable all tiers of the supply chain to benefit from early payment for goods or services provided.

Methodology: Behind the Rankings

Global Finance editors select the winners for both the Trade Finance Awards and the Supply Chain Finance Awards with input from industry analysts corporate executives and technology experts. The editors also consider entries submitted by financial services providers as well as independent research taking into account a set of objective and subjective factors. This year’s ratings which cover 102 countries and eight regions were based on performance during the period from the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021.

It is not necessary to enter in order to win but experience shows that the additional information supplied in an entry can increase the chance of success. In many cases entrants are able to present details and insights that may not be readily available to the editors of Global Finance.

The winners are those banks and providers that best serve the specialized needs of corporations as they engage in cross-border trade. The winners are not always the biggest institutions but rather the best: those with qualities that companies should consider most carefully when choosing a provider. Global Finance uses a proprietary algorithm with criteria—such as knowledge of local conditions and customer needs financial strength and safety strategic relationships and governance competitive pricing capital investment and innovation in products and services—weighted for relative importance. Each entity is rated on each separate criterion. The algorithm incorporates those ratings into a single numeric score with 100 equivalent to perfection. In cases where more than one institution earns the same score we favor local providers over global institutions and privately-owned over government-owned institutions.

GLOBAL WINNERS

BEST SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROVIDER — BANK

Citi

Winning the global award for Best Supply Chain Finance Provider–Bank is not just about the number of markets served or the number of supply chain finance programs a provider supports. With one of the largest transaction banking networks Citi boasts encouraging metrics on both counts. But more important especially during a pandemic is its ability to scale and implement its services quickly as supply chains adjust to the new business norms.

Liquidity remains a significant portion of any SCF program and Citi’s global reach permits it to source liquidity from its balance sheet or a pool of investors. A noteworthy addition to the bank’s SCF toolbox is its Dynamic Discounting offering which it launched in Europe and the US. The service enables buyers to make cash more readily available to mid- to long-tail suppliers where demand for financing is typically the greatest.

BEST SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROVIDER — NON-BANK

Orbian

Fintechs in SCF come and go but Orbian founded in 1999 by Citi and enterprise-software provider SAP continues its mainstay status. The company focuses on supporting buyer-led SCF programs via innovations such as Express SCF that are designed to make SCF accessible to all suppliers regardless of their size or location.

Alongside its traditional SCF programs which Orbian offers in more than 50 countries Express SCF facilitates early payment in more than 100 countries. The fintech also recently launched a fixed rate offering—an alternative to pricing programs based on Libor or other floating-rate mechanisms—that lets suppliers lock in a rate on any discounts for up to five years. It is 20 years’ worth of collected data permitting better risk modeling that makes such a service possible according to Orbian.

BEST CUSTOMER IMPLEMENTATION

DBS Bank

Leveraging its digital-first strategy and application programming interface (API) suite Singapore-headquartered DBS Bank helped renewable-materials provider Stora Enso monetize its growing accounts receivable portfolio and remove costly inefficient and paper-based processes for managing its incoming receivables. As the company’s days sales outstanding (DSO) had doubled from 60 to 120 days with growing cross-border transactions its finance team were spending more time physically matching invoices and custom and tax declaration forms with their corresponding payments. This gave them little visibility on the status of incoming payments.

Using a combination of DBS Bank’s Supplier Payment Services providing automatic and selective payments for suppliers; its digital supplier onboarding tools; and its DigiDocs offering the bank made the customer journey entirely paperless for Stora Enso. The vendor’s financial team used DBS’ digital corporate banking platform and Swift gpi for cross-border payments to trace incoming payments from buyers in real time.

The bank also set up a digital accounts receivable purchase program to ease the impact that Stora Enso’s widening DSO had on its working capital and to increase its cash conversion cycle so that the company could be paid quicker.

“Teams on both sides worked very well and effectively together to guarantee a smooth process and quick implementation and ramp-up all around” says Wei Li-Tuomela vice president and head of Treasury at Stora Enso.

BEST PROVIDER OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE SOLUTIONS IN SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE

ASYX

Sustainability may be a current buzzword in finance but it does not always easily translate into action for small and midsize enterprises (SMEs). For one thing many systems that track sustainability as goods and services move through global supply chains are often geared for larger companies. The mission of Southeast Asian supply chain integration firm ASYX is to facilitate faster business expansion for SMEs using various forms of supply chain financing and to help them better understand and integrate sustainability into their systems.

With a strong focus on agroindustry and forestry value chains ASYX is well positioned to support sustainable financing initiatives that lead to real change. In Indonesia it supports environmental efforts to preserve rural peatlands and mangroves. In the apparel sector it is helping SMEs that produce natural yarns and fibers in rural areas to scale up their business and become more agile.

BEST BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCING SOLUTION

FQX

Describing itself as “the first market-ready solution for eNotes” which are unconditional promises to pay specific sums to other parties on a selected date FQX combines an old concept with new technology in the form of its Swiss Trust Chain. This is a private blockchain from Swisscom and Swiss Post that incorporates a patent-pending authentication mechanism which FQX says is based on regulated and qualified electronic signatures provided by Swisscom.

FQX’s eNote infrastructure can be integrated into the financing platforms of banks and fintechs “[allowing] for the standardized and globally scalable transfer of unconditional promises to pay radically facilitating supply chain and corporate finance” the vendor adds. For example companies can use eNotes to generate free cash flow improve working-capital metrics and ultimately replace inefficient and costly paper-based trade and supply chain finance processes.

BEST NEW APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE

Vayana Network

With a focus on SMEs India’s Vayana Network leverages plug-and-play APIs data analytics and digital technologies to make it easier for companies of any size to participate in SCF programs.

For one fast-moving consumer-goods vendor assessing researching and servicing an extensive network of distributors proved to be time-consuming and expensive. However using real-time upstream data to identify creditworthy distributors Vayana provided financing offerings that ensured that just as much of the distribution chain would be covered.

Vayana’s platform offered the consumer-goods company a range of financing possibilities beyond standard reverse factoring including receivables securitization and a “specially structured last-mile retailer program.” In addition to its data analytics capabilities being the largest goods and services tax (GST) Suvidha Provider for API-based connections to India’s GST network for tax filing and e-invoicing also has its advantages says Vayana as it allows it to analyze data assess risk onboard partners and disburse and collect money quickly.

BEST DYNAMIC DISCOUNTING SOLUTION

MUFG

Dynamic discounting which enables buyers to use their balance sheets instead of banks provides suppliers with early payment in return for a sizeable discount on their invoices. It is typically dominated by fintechs. Nonetheless Japanese banking giant MUFG which entered US SCF following its 2019 acquisition of GE Capital’s Trade Payables Services platform is one of the few banking providers whose proprietary SCF platform supports standard SCF and dynamic discounting.

For one large US-based customer looking to improve its working-capital metrics across different business units in various countries MUFG proposed a solution that combined a receivables purchase program for its largest suppliers and dynamic discounting for its remaining suppliers. According to the bank the dynamic discounting service delivered a yield of 12% APR and $50 million to $60 million in “realized supplier discounts” or reductions in the cost of goods sold year-on-year. In total the combined program realized more than $1 billion in cash flow benefits according to MUFG.

BEST PLATFORM CONNECTING BUYERS/SELLERS/FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

PrimeRevenue

The Atlanta-based software-as-a-service SCF platform provider PrimeRevenue connects more than 30000 customers in more than 80 countries. Its global funding network includes more than 100 partners and supports more than 30 currencies. The platform’s ability to tap into multiple funding providers has led customers to expand their SCF programs to reap the benefits of better financing availability.

A newly added function SurePay speeds up payments to suppliers by letting buyers consolidate their entire supplier base onto a single payment platform and eliminating the need to manage multiple enterprise resource planning (ERP) and payment systems.

BEST SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

riskmethods

Getting ahead of supplier risk issues that can crop up at any time in complex global supply chains is the holy grail for many companies. But in a business primarily based on a complex web of international relationships building in a certain level of predictability to warn companies how their suppliers could be affected by geopolitical economic or other risks is challenging at the best of times.

However Munich-based riskmethods’ Risk Intelligence engine eliminates much of the guesswork. The engine analyzes millions of data points from media and other sources to identify relevant supply chain threats in real time. Its offering processes more than 2.5 million potentially relevant risk indicators and conducts between 400000 and 500000 risk assessments per month.

How can companies distinguish between what is just noise and what is relevant? The platform’s Noise Cancellation feature alerts users to only the most critical information so that users are not bombarded with false alarms.

REGIONAL WINNERS

AFRICA

Standard Bank

Few banks understand the intricacies of trading in local African markets as well as Standard Bank does. With a heritage of 160 years in the region and a robust sub-Saharan network the bank possesses an in-depth knowledge of local market regulations and customs. Leveraging the strong trading ties between Africa and China Standard Bank was also one of the first African banks to forge a relationship with a Chinese bank namely the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China which acquired a controlling interest in the bank in 2015. Their partnership lets customers in the Africa-China trade corridor benefit from the bank’s structuring and technology expertise. Standard Bank works closely with companies in the oil and gas sector structuring solutions that improve working capital and liquidity metrics while assuming the credit and market risk from receivables purchasing programs. The bank even supports holistic solutions integrating SCF with logistics management.

ASIA-PACIFIC

DBS BANK

Much of DBS’ success in growing its SCF business in the Asia-Pacific region can be attributed to its efforts to be a digital-first bank. This not just about how many markets it is in throughout the region—although that’s important—but also the bank’s expansive API suite. At last count the suite had more than 200 corporate and institutional banking APIs with almost a third of them being trade related. Through APIs the bank can help customers transition to paperless trade more seamlessly by making it easier for the client’s ERP and trade systems to interact with bank systems in real time. Companies can submit documents and financing requests digitally with little or no manual effort resulting in faster processing times and greater visibility across a transaction’s lifecycle.

A digital-first mindset and a comprehensive suite of APIs mean DBS can also partner with fintechs looking to disrupt the trade and supply chain finance industry more readily. Among the fintechs with which the bank has worked are AntChain a blockchain-based trade platform; and CredAble an Indian fintech that provides working-capital finance for SMEs.

CARIBBEAN

Scotiabank

Although Scotiabank has scaled back its presence in the Caribbean and Central America it still operates in 25 countries across the region with strong historical ties to key markets—such as Jamaica where it has supported trade since 1889. The bank has the aspiration to help its customers expand their business wherever they do business “across Canada into the United States the Caribbean and Central and South America” the bank writes in its 2021 annual report. “Our long history across the Americas has given us a deep understanding of how these countries operate the strengths of their economies and the aspirations of the people who live and work there.”

CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE

UniCredit

Instead of a one size fits all approach to SCF UniCredit uses in-house innovation and collaborates with fintechs to develop fully customized working capital offerings to meet the financing needs of its customers in Central and Eastern Europe. In Russia for example the bank devised a digital agent factoring service for accounts payable management to support the entire supply chain for a local manufacturing client. In Slovenia the bank structured a program that benefited buyers and suppliers—the buyers extended their payables while the suppliers received their payments sooner—despite the challenging time frames and an entirely new structure for the bank’s local branch. In addition UniCredit banking teams in different countries—the Czech Republic Germany and Romania—worked together with the help of a fintech to deliver a bespoke SCF offering for an international customer.

LATIN AMERICA

BBVA

The Spanish bank has provided local banking services in Latin America for more than 40 years and its SCF programs encompass core markets such as Mexico Peru and Colombia. In 2020 the region accounted for more than half of the bank’s overall profits. Moreover the region is of even greater value to the bank following the recent divestment of its US retail banking operations according to analysts. The bank has based the bulk of its SCF programs in Mexico and Peru where BBVA boasts a more than 20% market share. In 2020 BBVA launched its new cloud-based global SCF platform which provides a single point of access and full traceability of all invoices and payments. The platform supports payments in local currency in Mexico Peru and Colombia. In addition BBVA plans to roll out support for the Argentinian market later this year.

MIDDLE EAST

First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB)

As the largest banking group by assets in the UAE First Abu Dhabi Bank is one of the first banks in the Middle East to develop a fully automated SCF offering which is in production with several international customers and programs. Throughout 2021 the bank implemented various SCF programs collaborating with government agencies to support SMEs. It partnered with the Department of Finance in Abu Dhabi and health insurer Daman to provide a 6 billion dirham ($1.6 billion) SCF program to ensure rapid payment of receivables for SMEs in the health care sector. Other noteworthy deals include an Islamic SCF program that supports suppliers in the UAE and acting as co-lead arranger on a program supporting SME suppliers and corporates for one of the major members of the Gulf Cooperation Council.

NORTH AMERICA

Bank of America

With solid growth in its SCF portfolio in 2020 Bank of America witnessed continued growth throughout 2021. The North American corporate banking giant which invests billions in technology annually looks to compete with innovative fintechs in SCF by investing in APIs and data analytics to deliver greater operational efficiencies and insights to its clients and their suppliers. For example the bank now provides real-time payment status information directly to buyers’ ERP systems via APIs. Its Supplier Enablement Portal which the bank rolled out to North American customers in 2020 uses data analytics to analyze buyers’ spending with suppliers aiding supplier segmentation and prioritization of strategic suppliers for onboarding to buyer-led financing programs.

WESTERN EUROPE

BBVA

BBVA’s global SCF platform which it launched in 2020 enables customers to pay suppliers in up to 20 currencies. The new cloud-based platform is designed to make it easier for the bank to onboard the entire supplier base of creditworthy buyers without imposing any limits on the number of invoices or amount of financing. Buyers can also more easily track invoices and payments to suppliers. Given that its biggest markets are based in its European stronghold—where the bank is headquartered—and in South America the bank is geographically diversified enough to meet its European customers’ local or global SCF needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFua2luZy9tb3JnYW4tc3RhbmxleS1sYXd5ZXItZG91Ymxlcy1kb3duLW9uLXdhbGwtc3RyZWV0LW9mZmljZS1yZXR1cm7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morgan Stanley lawyer doubles down on Wall Street office return,"NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - Morgan Stanley's top lawyer said on Friday (Jan 28) that veteran outsiders who criticised his push to end remote work are missing an opportunity to connect with the next generation of leaders.

""Two years of not being together is fraying those bonds"" Mr Eric Grossman said in a Fordham Law School talk.

Almost a fourth of Morgan Stanley's workers started during the coronavirus pandemic and ""a bunch of them have never spent time in the office - they don't know what we're like"" he said.

Much of the negative reaction to his call to return to the office came from ""fully formed lawyers"" Mr Grossman said.

""'I don't need to be in the office I'm super-efficient at home I'm serving my clients I'm getting everything done'"" he said paraphrasing the criticisms. ""But we are stewards for the next generation.""

Mr Grossman Morgan Stanley's long-time chief legal officer and one of the top paid lawyers on Wall Street in a July memo to outside law firms and legal service providers said they should end remote work and bring lawyers back to the office. The memo suggested that those continuing to operate remotely risked their relationship with the financial services company.

Being a lawyer is not a job but a career and a profession that requires in-person training and mentoring Mr Grossman said in the Friday discussion held over Zoom as part of Fordham's law firm management programme.

As Mr Grossman said he sees it the lunches dinners meetings and post-conference call debriefings he benefited from as a young lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell need to be ""paid back"" by senior lawyers to those just starting their careers.

Mr Grossman jokingly noted that he might be the only Morgan Stanley employee on the floor of his office on a snowy Friday in New York.

For financial services firms remote work has made it difficult to foster a common culture Mr Grossman said. While the Covid-19 Omicron variant has delayed the plans of Morgan Stanley and other big banks to bring employees back to the office Mr Grossman said he is optimistic that many workers - lawyers or otherwise - are looking forward to being together again some for mental health reasons.

Mr Grossman who once served as Davis Polk's global head of litigation added that ""50 per cent of my professional development was sitting in some partner's office when the client called up unhappy and watching him or her deal with an unhappy client"".

He said it is nearly impossible to have that same experience working remotely and that today's Big Law associates are missing out on learning how to manage many issues.

""Brainstorming does not happen"" Mr Grossman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2QxMmIzYjI4LTU0NzItNDkwNS1iYzRlLTRlMTE2YjJmZjQ5ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Air taxis: flight of fantasy or truly set for lift off?,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

All the talk has been about how the Gold Coast has dominated the South East Queensland apartment market since COVID triggered an exodus from the southern states.

And the fanfare around the coastal areas with the majority of the country working from home for the last few years has seen Queensland's capital fly quietly under the radar.

Mosaic Property Group Founder and Managing Director Brook Monahan believes the inner ring surrounds of Brisbane has the most potential of any market in the state and is looking to invest even further across its development pipeline after building a solid reputation over the last 17 years across south east Queensland.

""There's just not enough high quality built form for owner occupiers wanting bigger units and world class amenity in the five kilometre ring around Brisbane"" Monahan said suggesting there's been a chronic undersupply for that type of buyer since around 2018.

""That issue is getting worse not better with the amount of people still moving to Brisbane"" Monahan added.



The Witton in Indooroopilly which Mosaic sold out last year

Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Queensland gained around 7000 people from net interstate migration over the March 2021 quarter alone.

""With the amount of infrastructure being delivered across the city not to mention international travel getting back to normal at some point this year and the pipeline of development in preparation for the 2032 Summer Olympics there is just nowhere near enough housing stock.""

The low stock is a pain point for the owner-occupier demographic but not for investors who Monahan says aren't quite back in full force just yet.

While Mosaic tend to cater for local owner occupiers in their developments some investors who bought apartments to lease in Brisbane have seen rental yields go through the roof.

""If it's difficult to buy a larger apartment due to low supply then the only option is to rent and those who invested are benefitting from the tight supply and huge migration numbers"" Monahan said.

Mosaic will be launching five projects in Brisbane across 2022 nine all up across South East Queensland. They'll be venturing into the Kangaroo Point and EAST BRISBANE apartment markets after much success there in recent years including the The Sinclair which is fully sold out and due for completion mid this year.

One of their major focuses for the last eight years has been in Brisbane's inner west suburbs which Monahan identified as a high growth area back in 2014. Last year they sold out The Witton in Indooroopilly The Patterson in Toowong and Kensington in Toowong with all sales going to database buyers before hitting the open market.

The first to launch this year will also be in Toowong which will be Mosaic's 11th project in the space of six years in the inner-west.

The development designed by DKO directly behind Toowong Shopping Centre will offer a mix of large two and three-bedroom units and luxury penthouses.

The facade is inspired by the detailing and repetition of the traditional Queenslander. The veiled podium references the nearby Regatta Hotel on the Brisbane River.

There are four different zones on the rooftop. There's a wet zone including pool and wet deck with views to the city and river; a dining zone including outdoor BBQ area and shelter overlooking the city and river; a wellness zone which is a combination of a yoga lawn and gardens; and the multiuse zone to the south west which can be utilised for co-working during office hours or a communal kitchen and dining area after hours and on the weekends.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this Motley Fool Live video recorded on Jan. 19 Fool contributors Keith Speights and Brian Orelli discuss whether or not the prospects of a fourth dose are dwindling.

10 stocks we like better than Pfizer

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10 2022

Keith Speights: I mentioned that there were results from a study conducted in Israel and they were announced this week. This study found that a fourth dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine did not prevent infections from the coronavirus omicron variant. Both of these stocks fell on the news on Tuesday. Are the prospects of a fourth dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dwindling you think?

Brian Orelli: Yeah. The study tested this fourth dose of the vaccine and it did bring the antibody levels back up. But researchers said that that wouldn't actually protect patients from the omicron variant. I think a fourth dose of the original vaccine certainly seems less likely than before.

But Pfizer and BioNTech as well as Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) and others are developing omicron-specific boosters. I think there's still hope for the vaccine makers that they can have at least one more round of boosters if the new variant specific boosters actually work which we don't know yet. But assuming they actually work and I think it's likely that would be the case. I think vaccine makers aren't dead in the water quite yet.

Speights: Brian Moderna stock also fell although not as much as BioNTech. Do you think investors were just assuming that there would be similar results with the fourth dose of the Moderna vaccine?

Orelli: Yeah. They actually tested Moderna after Pfizer in this study as well. I think that the results are likely to be the same. I think they really need an omicron-specific booster at this point.

Speights: My mom texted me last night asking how long do the third boosters last? My response was no one knows yet. Have you seen any data at all so far that indicates how long the third booster's efficacy is likely to extend?

Orelli: Yeah. I don't think we have enough people who've been out from a third dose long enough to have a good idea. It becomes really difficult because the way who do you compare it to?

If you're looking at the people who have gotten a third dose are you comparing it to the people who got two doses? Or I guess that's makes the most sense. But then finding an equal group that you think is equally as likely to get infected becomes sort of difficult.

You can certainly look at antibody levels and that's after the third dose and look and see if they are watching them decline. You can do that. But actually looking at whether the third dose provides protection from either infection or from severe disease I think is a little more difficult to measure over time.

Speights: You made a good point Brian. Any testing of fourth doses of the current vaccines might really be a moot point because Pfizer and BioNTech expect to have their omicron-specific vaccine version ready by March I think. By the time we might be at a point where fourth doses could be needed these omicron-specific vaccines could be ready.

While the low-fare airline giant rapidly expanded its route network to new cities to capture incremental demand that it could not serve previously it didn't see the financial benefits that bullish investors had expected.

For the full year Southwest lost about $1.3 billion excluding grants received from the federal airline payroll support programs. And whereas Southwest Airlines stock rallied to a multiyear high of nearly $65 last April the shares have since shed about a third of their value ending last week at $42.93.

Fortunately Southwest Airlines finally returned to profitability last quarter. Furthermore the company's results should improve significantly over the next few years as air travel patterns normalize.

A solid end to the year

In October Southwest projected that its fourth-quarter revenue would fall 15% to 25% compared to 2019. Combined with rising fuel prices and nonfuel unit cost inflation this implied that it would post yet another quarterly loss.

However at the carrier's investor day in early December management revealed that demand had recovered rapidly in the preceding weeks with particular strength around the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally Southwest Airlines signed a new co-branded credit card agreement with Chase in early December featuring improved economic terms. That put the company on track to record a profit in the fourth quarter.

Ultimately Southwest booked $5.05 billion of revenue for the fourth quarter: down 11.8% from 2019 on an 8.3% capacity reduction. This allowed the company to withstand higher fuel prices and a 10.6% increase in adjusted nonfuel unit costs compared to two years earlier and earn a profit of $0.14 per share. That beat the analyst consensus of $0.07.

Expecting a quick rebound from the omicron variant

At the time of Southwest Airlines' investor day management anticipated that the company would earn a profit in every quarter of 2022. Unfortunately the severe impact of the omicron variant on demand and staffing has thrown a wrench into those plans.

Southwest estimates that it will miss out on $330 million of revenue in January and February combined because of this short-term drop in demand. As a result first quarter revenue is set to decline 10% to 15% compared to Q1 2019 on approximately 9% less capacity.

Meanwhile the impact of capacity cuts and an incentive program to keep planes flying despite a surge in sick calls will drive a 20% to 24% increase in nonfuel unit costs over the same period. Fuel costs have moved higher too. This will cause Southwest to book a loss for the first quarter.

However with COVID-19 case counts starting to decline again in the U.S. demand is already recovering. By the month of March Southwest expects to be back in the black and profitability should continue to strengthen over the course of 2022 as demand improves and cost pressures ease.

Finally worth a look again

For most of 2021 investor euphoria about the potential post-pandemic recovery had Southwest Airlines stock trading at levels that didn't leave much room for error. Not surprisingly that led to poor share price performance as the airline experienced various setbacks in the second half of the year.

By contrast Southwest Airlines stock now trades at an attractive valuation of 10 times its 2019 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.27. Southwest has numerous initiatives to boost EPS beyond that level including fleet upgrades and efforts to boost fares by appealing to more business travelers. Additionally the company has a substantial amount of excess cash that it will likely return to shareholders once restrictions on dividends and buybacks expire later this year.

To be fair I remain concerned about Southwest's rising costs. Management projects that adjusted nonfuel unit costs will rise 12% to 16% this year compared to 2019 before easing somewhat in 2023. Other airlines did a better job of finding permanent cost savings over the past two years. Higher costs could offset much of the benefit from Southwest's revenue initiatives.

Netflix

The Colombian series ""Café con Aroma de Mujer"" was Netflix's most-watched show last week.

It topped the new season of ""Ozark"" which debuted on Friday.

The series isn't available on Netflix in the US where it aired on Telemundo.

Netflix's ""Ozark"" returned for the first half of its final season on Friday to impressive viewership numbers. But it's not the streamer's biggest series right now.

The first season of the Colombian series ""Café con Aroma de Mujer"" a remake of a 1990s telenovela was viewed for 96.36 million hours globally from January 17 through January 23 according to Netflix.

""Ozark's"" fourth season was watched for 77.01 million hours last week.

Every Tuesday Netflix updates its most popular movies and TV shows based on hours watched during the previous week.

""Café con Aroma de Mujer"" has been in Netflix's list of its top 10 most-watched non-English language shows for four straight weeks. It topped the list the last three weeks maintaining steady viewership throughout.

December 27 to January 2 — 23.23 million hours (No. 5)

January 3 to January 9 — 82.98 million hours (No. 1)

January 10 to January 16 — 98.85 million hours (No. 1)

January 17 to January 23 — 96.36 million hours (No. 1)

The series isn't available on Netflix in the US where it aired on the Telemundo network. Its US streaming home is Peacock Telemundo parent company NBCUniversal's streaming service.

Telenovelas have been an area of focus for Netflix as it looks to attract more subscribers in Latin America. During the company's earnings call last week CFO Spencer Neumann cited ""macroeconomic strain"" from the coronavirus pandemic in regions like Latin America as a reason for why the company's growth has slowed.

On Thursday a Netflix VP of content for Latin America Roberto Stopello published a blog post highlighting upcoming novelas that will be released on the streaming service.

""A Netflix novela pairs the best of series with the best of novelas — taking so much of what we love from the novelas we grew up watching combined with the edge pace and freedom of the streaming world"" Stopello wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9uZXRmbGl4LWpvaW5zLWZvcmNlcy13aXRoLXJhai1hbmQtZGstZm9yLWd1bnMtYW5kLWd1bGFhYnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix Joins Forces With Raj & DK for Comedy-Crime-Thriller 'Guns & Gulaabs',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-joins-forces-with-raj-and-dk-for-guns-and-gulaabs on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9uZXRmbGl4LWpvaW5zLWZvcmNlcy13aXRoLXJhai1hbmQtZGstZm9yLWd1bnMtYW5kLWd1bGFhYnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vbmV0ZmxpeC1tb3ZpZXMta2lkcy1hZHVsdHMtZW5qb3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Netflix Movies That Can Be Enjoyed By Both Kids & Adults,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vbmV0ZmxpeC1tb3ZpZXMta2lkcy1hZHVsdHMtZW5qb3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vaG91c2UtbmV0ZmxpeC1jb25zdW1lcmlzbS1jcml0aWNpc20tcmVhbC1tZWFuaW5nLWV4cGxhaW5lZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix's The House's Real Meaning Explained,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vaG91c2UtbmV0ZmxpeC1jb25zdW1lcmlzbS1jcml0aWNpc20tcmVhbC1tZWFuaW5nLWV4cGxhaW5lZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The Brisbane suburb where you can still buy with an average wage

“I just really wanted to show my family and myself that I’m able to do things that I never thought I was capable of doing and I have a twin sister who is disabled and I wanted to show her that she is able to do anything that she puts her mind to and she can come and stay here if she likes” Angela said.

A crowd of 40 witnessed the emotional event with onlookers shocked when the eventual buyer was revealed.

“My youngest is 20 and he’s not standing competing and having the courage to do something like that on his own” Harcourts Solutions founding director Martin Millard said afterwards. “Eighteen-year-olds are not buying real estate. It’s a beautiful story it’s an extraordinary story.”

Angela stood in front of the letterbox of the four-bedroom brick house she was determined to buy with Harcourts estate agent Marie Stead bidding on her behalf and her mother on the phone. “I got mum’s okay” she said.

“I just fell in love with the place as soon as I saw it and she wants the best for her children so she decided to do whatever she could for us.

“I don’t have a job at the moment but I did get a payout from the hospital because I was born with a disability that could have been diagnosed earlier so I’m using my Trust money from that to pay for the house.”

Angela finished Year 12 at the end of 2020 and is currently studying a Certificate Three in Early Childhood.

“I didn’t know what to expect” she said in a shaky voice.

“It was way more intense than any Year 12 exam.”

The auction was part of a Harcourts Solutions auction bonanza hosted by agent Rochelle Adgo to kick off the 2022 auction season in Brisbane’s north.

The auction opened with a phone bid of $940000. Angela came in straight after with a bid of $950000. An older couple with young children also took part. The auction paused at $1.01m during which Angela increased her offer to $1.025m and the property sold. The auction was one of 80 scheduled across Greater Brisbane on Saturday."

“My youngest is 20 and he’s not standing competing and having the courage to do something like that on his own” Harcourts Solutions founding director Martin Millard said afterwards. “Eighteen-year-olds are not buying real estate. It’s a beautiful story it’s an extraordinary story.”

Angela stood in front of the letterbox of the four-bedroom brick house she was determined to buy with Harcourts estate agent Marie Stead bidding on her behalf and her mother on the phone. “I got mum’s okay” she said.

“I just fell in love with the place as soon as I saw it and she wants the best for her children so she decided to do whatever she could for us.

“I don’t have a job at the moment but I did get a payout from the hospital because I was born with a disability that could have been diagnosed earlier so I’m using my Trust money from that to pay for the house.”

Angela finished Year 12 at the end of 2020 and is currently studying a Certificate Three in Early Childhood.

“I didn’t know what to expect” she said in a shaky voice.

“It was way more intense than any Year 12 exam.”

The auction was part of a Harcourts Solutions auction bonanza hosted by agent Rochelle Adgo to kick off the 2022 auction season in Brisbane’s north.

The auction opened with a phone bid of $940000. Angela came in straight after with a bid of $950000. An older couple with young children also took part. The auction paused at $1.01m during which Angela increased her offer to $1.025m and the property sold. The auction was one of 80 scheduled across Greater Brisbane on Saturday."

The stock market is getting pummeled this year. Growth-focused stocks have gotten hit particularly hard as investors rotate out of that sector. While this sell-off has been brutal to stomach it's also providing some compelling opportunities for long-term investors.

The sell-off hit the tech sector the hardest which has captured investors' attention. That's causing many investors to overlook some under-the-radar growth stocks that have also tumbled during the correction. Two that stand out as more compelling opportunities right now are NextEra Energy (NEE 1.58%) and Prologis (PLD -1.15%).

A growth stock hiding in a slow-growth sector

Utility stocks tend to be the domain of income investors like retirees because they typically don't grow that fast. However NextEra Energy isn't your average utility. Over the last decade it has grown three times faster than other large utilities powered by its focus on the fast-growing state of Florida and the renewable energy megatrend.

These catalysts have created enormous value for long-term investors. Over the last decade NextEra has generated a more than 700% total return doubling the return of the S&P 500.

However despite its success shares of NextEra Energy have sold off this year tumbling more than 20% from its recent high. That's due somewhat to the recent announcement that it is handing the company over to a new generation of leadership which spooked investors. Because they focused on the leadership change they missed its accelerating growth rate.

NextEra recently reported its fourth-quarter results capping off an excellent year where it grew its adjusted earnings per share by 10.4%. Meanwhile the accelerating growth in renewable energy development boosted its earnings growth outlook for 2022 and 2023. It also extended its forecast out two more years. The utility now expects to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2022 with 6% to 8% annual earnings from that higher base through 2025.

That outlook is conservative. The company said it would be disappointed if it didn't deliver growth at or near the high-end of its range. Meanwhile there's upside potential to that long-term forecast if it makes acquisitions or the U.S. passes more legislation to spur additional renewable energy development.

With NextEra's stock down 20% it's trading at a much more attractive valuation given its accelerating long-term growth prospects.

Insatiable demand for this real estate

Growth-minded investors also often overlook real estate investment trusts (REITs) because they typically sacrifice growth for income. However that's not the case with leading industrial REIT Prologis. Demand for logistics properties is red hot these days enabling the REIT to grow rapidly.

Prologis has grown its cash flow per share at a double-digit compound annual rate over the last five years including 14% last year. Meanwhile it sees nearly unstoppable growth ahead as demand for industrial real estate grows. The sector is benefiting from the rapid shift toward e-commerce and a change in inventory management practices due to global supply chain issues.

These demand drivers are pushing up rental rates. Prologis captured 18% higher rental rates as existing leases expired last year. That provides lots of embedded growth because of the long-term nature of its leases. Prologis' existing portfolio has a $1.2 billion net operating income (NOI) growth opportunity at the current market rate for rents. That's meaningful for a company that produced $3.4 billion in NOI last year.

With demand continuing to grow Prologis estimates rents could surge another 10% this year providing even more embedded long-term growth upside potential for its legacy portfolio. On top of that the company can develop more logistics properties to further benefit from fast-rising demand. It has enough land to build $26 billion of new industrial properties giving it years of growth potential.

Despite this growth potential shares of Prologis have declined by 10% already this year. That had it trading at a much more attractive value given the growth still ahead.

Great ways to add new growth drivers to your portfolio

While technology stocks often offer some of the best growth potential it's not the only sector with growth stocks. NextEra Energy plugged into the renewable energy megatrend helping power accelerated growth. Meanwhile Prologis is benefiting from the accelerating adoption of e-commerce and the supply chain issues plaguing other companies to drive outsize growth. With their shares tumbling amid the market sell-off these under-the-radar growth stocks look like even more attractive long-term buys right now.",,,,,,

Nike is hiring for metaverse-related roles to expand its footprint in the virtual space.

The aim is to develop prototypes as well as the production of metaverse software and device solutions.

The world’s largest athletic apparel company Nike is determined to stake its claim in the metaverse. The company is building its metaverse team and hiring for key positions to expand its footprint in the tech world.

Over the last week Nike has posted five key roles to hire talents for its metaverse ambition or related functions in what it described as its Technology Innovation Office.

In its job posting the company is looking to hire a metaverse director whose role would be to lead the development of Nike’s “rapid end-to-end proof of concepts prototypes as well as production of metaverse software and device solutions.”

Other job titles posted on Linkedin include senior 3D game designer or metaverse engineer principal innovation designer for the metaverse expert innovation program manager for blockchain and a virtual material designer.

Nike is seeking to explore a broad range of metaverse technologies from web3 to the spatial web as the company looks to break into the virtual space. As per the job description the candidate must possess knowledge of technologies blockchain ecosystems culture including DLTs cryptocurrencies smart contracts dApps DAOs NFTs crypto wallets and more.

The metaverse is getting a boost from many tech giants such as Microsoft Apple and many more. Today Apple stock jumped after CEO Tim Cook revealed the company’s metaverse AR plans.

Considering Nike vs Adidas timeless tussle Adidas fetching $23 million from its metaverse NFT series prompted Nike to participate as well. Amid talent wars among tech giants Nike is scrambling to seize on the opportunity to deliver ground-breaking technology innovation products and services.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vZmFzaGlvbi8yODc4Ny9uaWtlLXp2ZXpkb2Noa2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The strange story of the Nike Zvezdochka,"Few sneakers have a more cult history than the Nike Zvezdochka – perhaps the most legendary project by an equally legendary designer: Marc Newson. Born in Sydney Marc Newson spent much of his childhood alternating between Europe and Asia. Since 1997 he has settled in London where his studio is still based. Newson is one of the most critically acclaimed and influential industrial designers of his generation his work has touched a wide range of sectors giving life to creations ranging from objects for the home to furniture to fashion passing through cars private planes yachts and architectural projects. His clients include many of the most famous and prestigious international brands with which he has carried out projects that have had unprecedented success; just think of the two pairs of Nike that bear his name the Apple products created when he was at the helm of the brand his work for Louis Vuitton or everything he created as an independent designer. Nonetheless the Nike Zvezdochka remain one of his most iconic works as far as sneaker culture is concerned.

Originally released in 2004 at a retail price of 500$ this futuristic silhouette created by Nike in collaboration with the Australian designer was released in 5 different colorways which marked the beginning of a series of releases that ended in 2014. The idea of making a similar product arose from Newson’s experience at the Russian Space Agency which inspired him to develop a multifunctional shoe for cosmonauts. The name which in Russian means ""star"" came from the name of the dog so named by Yuri Gagarin who was sent into space in March of '61 on the Korabl-Sputnik 5 test flight before the famous expedition of the latter that was held on April 12. The dog made a full circle around Earth's orbit before returning to Earth's surface unharmed. Zvezdochka's flight was very important celebrated with installations in museums and stamps as the success of the launch was the last step required to approve Gagarin's mission.

The Zvezdochka was designed with a complex 3D printed modular shape modeled entirely on a computer consisting of a flexible monobloc TPU upper combined with a replaceable mesh sock and a rubber sockliner equipped with grooves to bind the two components together. The interior sockliner also features a Nike Zoom Air unit embedded in the heel to improve cushioning. Moreover thanks to its modular structure the shoe is convertible for various needs and environments.

Two further iterations were released in September 2010 to commemorate the Transport exhibition held at the Gagosian Gallery in New York City where Newson presented a speedboat he designed for the renowned Italian brand Riva. The two reissues were exclusively available at 21 Mercer St. Nike Store in NYC in the Aegean Blue and Mahogany Red colorways nodding to the boat’s ones.

Eventually to honor the 10-year anniversary of the Zvezdochka that recurred in December 2014 Nike re-released an updated version of the five original colorways at selected Nikelab Stores for a retail price of $300. This was the last official release of Zvezdochka and for the occasion Mark Parker CEO of Nike commented:

«For the Zvevdochka we knew we had broken new ground: a shoe with four interchangeable parts. It was such a simplified process and led to new exploration in how products are made and the potential for customization. It’s a great example of how a functional innovation helps drive a completely new aesthetic».

In addition to the previously mentioned styles Nike made and commissioned other variants of the Zvezdochka including samples that have never been produced on a large scale. An example are the 25 pairs of light in-the-dark Zvezdochkas produced in collaboration with Tim Biskup the ones conceived by Wieden + Kennedy or the unreleased samples that you can admire scrolling through the gallery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEvbmlrZS1haXItaHVhcmFjaGUtc291dGgtYmVhY2gtMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Nike Air Huarache ""South Beach"" Sneaker Miami","Nike has been treating the Air Huarache to a host of tasteful drops lately — from the Sandalwood “Mowabb” pack to the latest iteration which pays homage to the vibrant colors of South Beach.

In anticipation of the upcoming Spring/Summer season the Swoosh dresses the timeless silhouette with Miami’s signature color palette of aqua black hot pink and grey. Staying true to the classic the shoe comes equipped with a neoprene base subtle synthetic leather overlays a white midsole and a flashy tiger camo insole to complete the look.

The grey and black accents complement the flashiness of the aqua well where the shoe feels flashy but still relatively pared back. The Air Huarache “South Beach” does not have a release date yet but you can expect to see the sneaker drop for $120 USD sometime in the coming months. Please visit Nike for more info.

Northern Ireland assembly elections took place on 5 May 2022. Northern Ireland has special power-sharing arrangements that require the largest political parties from both communities – unionist and nationalist – to be in government.

The nationalist party Sinn Féin won the most seats in the assembly for the first time and are therefore entitled to the position of first minister. However until January 2024 the DUP the largest unionist party said that it would not nominate a deputy first minister unless there were significant changes to the Ireland/Northern Ireland protocol – the part of the Brexit deal that creates special trading arrangements for Northern Ireland – over which the former first minister Paul Givan resigned in February 2022.

Between May 2022 and January 2024 the Northern Ireland Assembly convened seven times but failed to nominate a Speaker or Deputy Speaker without the support of the DUP. This in effect prevented the timetable for executive formation from progressing.

In December 2023 the UK government publicly stated that talks over Northern Ireland Executive formation concluded and left a £3.3bn financial package on offer. Later in January 2024 and following further talks the DUP party executive met to agree they would re-enter power sharing arrangements. With the UK government publishing its offer in the Safeguarding the Union Command Paper Parliament is now expected to pass new legislation to implement the deal including legislation to affirm Northern Ireland’s constitutional status to guarantee access to the UK internal market to future-proof the operation of the UK internal market and to amend section 7A of the UK Withdrawal Act to reflect the Stormont Brake and democratic consent mechanisms. Subject to the passage of relevant legislation it is expected that the Northern Ireland Assembly will be recalled and eventually a new executive may be nominated.

How does government in Northern Ireland work?

Northern Ireland has power-sharing institutions as established under the Good Friday Agreement which have responsibility for transferred matters including health social care housing education justice and policing and social security. Its unique governance arrangements are designed to protect the rights of both communities.

Members of the Northern Ireland assembly (MLAs) are elected using the proportional single transferable vote system. MLAs must then designate themselves as either ‘unionists’ ‘nationalist’ or ‘other’.

The Northern Ireland executive is drawn from the assembly and consists of a first minister and deputy first minister and eight ministers who oversee departments as set out in law. Despite their titles the first minister and deputy first minister have the same powers and jointly oversee the executive committee comprised of other ministers. They are required to come from different political designations and so Northern Ireland’s governance arrangements can be described as a mandatory coalition.

How are the first minister and deputy first minister appointed?

The Northern Ireland Act 1998 states that the largest party in the largest community designation in the assembly is automatically entitled to the position of first minister and the largest party in the second-largest community designation is entitled to the position of deputy first minister.

However there is a caveat in the legislation that states that if the largest party is not from the largest designation then that party will still be entitled to nominate a first minister and the largest party from the largest designation is entitled to nominate the deputy first minister. This creates a situation where the first minister need not come from the largest (or even second largest) designation but the deputy first minister must do so potentially making it more difficult for a party from the ‘other’ designation like the Alliance Party to become deputy first minster.

For example in scenario 1 the DUP is the largest party in the largest designation (unionist) and therefore is entitled to the position of first minister. The second-largest designation is nationalist so Sinn Féin being the largest party in that designation is entitled to the position of deputy first minister. The Alliance Party despite having more seats would not be entitled to the deputy first minister position because ‘other’ is not the second-largest designation.

In scenario 2 the largest party Alliance is not from the largest designation but is still entitled to the position of first minister. Sinn Féin as the largest party from the largest designation (nationalist) is entitled to deputy first minister.

Scenario 1 Scenario 2 DUP (unionist) 30 15 UUP (unionist) 10 10 Sinn Féin (nationalist) 19 25 SDLP (nationalist) 10 10 Alliance (other) 21 30 First minister DUP Alliance Deputy first minister Sinn Féin Sinn Féin

Entitled parties nominate an MLA for their respective positions. If that person does not take up office a further nomination may be made.

How are other ministers appointed to the Northern Ireland executive?

Most other ministerial positions are allocated to political parties according to party strength in the assembly using the d’Hondt system – where a mathematical formula allocates both the number of executive posts to which a party is entitled and the order in which they choose their portfolio. This can mean that some of the most troublesome portfolios such as health are chosen late and often go to the smaller parties. Parties can decline to nominate a person for a ministerial position and instead join the official opposition as the SDLP and UUP did in 2016.

The glory days of rail transport which was relatively enthralling during its heyday are still a distance memory as several railway stations remain desolate while others survive with epileptic operations despite the current transformation of the transport system under President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.

Daily Trust on Sunday highlights scenarios of some stations with nostalgic tales by residents who have called on government to revamp the system with a view to restoring its lost glory.

Rail transport believed to be the safest transport system used to enjoy a lot of patronage in this country when service was at its best.

The transport system also enhanced deep economic fortunes when railway stations used to buzz with business and or economic activities which also boosted the social and economic prosperity of railway towns.

But the reverse is now the case as many railway stations have not only become ghost towns but several people have also relocated to other places due to the declining fortunes at the stations which they maximised as business centres.

Kafanchan station desolate

The Kafanchan Railway Station is the administrative headquarters of the North Central District of the Nigerian Railway Corporation. It comprises about three sub-districts: Jos (Plateau State) Lafia (Nasarawa State) and Makurdi (Benue State).

In the late ’80s when trains used to operate from the North to the South East through Kafanchan the North-Central District generated about 30 percent of the railway’s revenue from passengers traffic. Transportation of goods from the North to and from the South East had also enhanced the socio-economic life of the benefitting areas.

For someone who was familiar with the Kafanchan railway station about 30 years back when movement of trains in out of the town was on a daily basis entering the station would now spur nostalgia.

Findings by Daily Trust on Sunday indicated that about three passenger trains used to either come or leave the station daily with Lagos-Jos Lagos-Maiduguri and Kano-Port Harcourt trips. Each of them used to carry between 16 and 17 wagons. Cattle trains used to move from Maiduguri to Port Harcourt Kaduna to Maiduguri and Port Harcourt to Kaduna thrice in a week. But this is no longer the case.

Being a railway town Kafanchan used to buzz with business activities. Traders hawkers beggars orange and palm oil merchants from Benue and Enugu States used to converge at the station to carry out their business activities. The town became a business centre of sorts due to transshipment of passengers from one train station to another. This opened a floodgate of business authorities for men and women folks in Kafanchan.

Linda Ezekiel a 60-year-old woman who used to trade at the station confirmed in a chat with Daily Trust on Sunday that in the ’80s the station used to be a beehive of activities with many people engaging in diverse business activities. “I can say that almost everybody was benefitting. I used to bring 30 bags of oranges and sell on whole sale basis to retailers. I made a lot of money then. Now look at what the system has turned to. Almost everything has gone. Our businesses have died” she said.

Aminu Tahir another business man at the station narrated how as a young boy he used to accompany his sister to sell cooked food to labourers and passengers whenever they were waiting for train.

“But now there is no such thing. The station has turned to a bush” he said.

A butcher Alhaji Sama’ila Labaran said when it was functioning the station enhanced reduction in cost of transportation and prices of goods in shops and markets.

“Transportation of cattle to and from the North to the East was cheap. Instead of spending many days during long walk moving cattle to one place to the other making them to emaciate trains were used to transport them easily safely and directly into towns. It was much more profitable even for farmers as the cattle would produce more meat” he said.

Labaran however called on the Federal Government to intensify more efforts in rehabilitating the railway and restore business opportunities to host communities.

A retired NRC staffer Usman Danbala told Daily Trust Saturday that when the Kafanchan railway station was used to be alive with business activities most farmers from villages such as Kogum Jagindi and many others used to transport foodstuffs such as garri cassava tomatoes bitter leaf maize and corns to Kafanchan market through local trains.

Danbala who retired 10 years ago after serving for 35 years at the station said the poor and downtrodden had been the major beneficiaries of the railway service when activities were at their peak. He however bemoaned the worsening state of facilities and declination of railway transport and its fortunes for the people.

Zungeru now ghost house

Daily Trust on Sunday gathered that economic activities at Zungeru rail station had stopped as trains no longer operate regularly as there are no fixed days for operations.

The Zungeru Rail Station which has a history of enthralling economic activities has now become a ghost house. All that is now left of the place are sounds of birds and chirps of insects obsolete rail tracks grounded train coaches as well as dilapidated staff quarters and abandoned facilities.

Daily Trust on Sunday gathered that the station which was the first railway track in Northern Nigeria and brought by the Governor-General Lord Fedrick Lugard between 1900 and 1914 connected several villages and towns including Gwarjiko.

Residents told our correspondent that the rail station which also connected several farm villages inspired a lot of economic benefits in the past as people trooped there on daily basis to buy and sell.

In those days people used to come from villages and other towns to carry out their trading activities.

The railway also connected major towns and cities including Kano Zaria Kaduna Mokwa Minna Gwagwada Rigachukwu Challawa in the North as well as Lagos Ilorin Ogbomosho and Ibadan in the South.

The station located in an agrarian community started deteriorating after the return of democracy 20 years ago. Residents said the railway system enjoyed the presence of the military government marked by economic fortunes for the people and the town.

Alhaji Abdulraheem Hamzat Zungeru 76 the Sarkin Yarubawan Zungeru who had lived his entire life in Zungeru since 1946 said: “The Zungeru rail station has deteriorated so much. But I wouldn’t say it has collapsed completely since the train still moves up and down. But it has become like a ghost house compared to the past. In the past if you went to the railway station you would see people always moving up and down with passengers going and coming. That time you had passengers from Lagos Kano and other places. They always came and crossed one another even at Zungeru here.”

He added: So there were many people going up and down. It used to be a very busy place. It was so busy that if you were going to travel you would have to queue up to get your ticket. If you wanted to go to Ilorin Ibadan Osogbo or Kano Kaduna you would have to queue to get your ticket. A lot of people used to come from Lagos with their goods like kola nuts and many other things from the South to sell. They also loaded cattle in trains from here to the Southern part of the country. So many business activities going on during that time.”

Daily Trust on Sunday also gathered that the railway station used to handle other activities such as petroleum products from the South to other towns such including Kontagora Minna and other places in the state.

“But as time went on all these activities went down. The railway is no longer functioning. It has been a dull situation of some sort. Nothing is happening again.”

“During that time the town was booming with economic activities. Many schools were functioning very well. In fact at that time one would be prompted to say that Zungeru should have been the headquarters of Nigeria. We also had a post office here. One of the Nigeria post offices we had was in this Zungeru. It was opened by Chief S. A. Akintola when he was the Minister of Communications. There were a lot of markets where massive buying and selling used to thrive. But now many things have died down. Many people have relocated to other places. I know some people who have relocated because they could not find anything serious to do since the station collapsed. Many of them had left Zungeru to settle in other places.”

The station has lost so many things. That is why many people left Zungeru because the station has lost business prospects.”

Alhaji Hamzat lamented that the deteriorated condition of the station had ruined the economic fortunes of the people of the town.

He appealed to the government to revamp the railway station especially by rehabilitating the staff buildings and restore the lost days of economic boom that the town enjoyed when the station was functioning properly.

He added that with the coming of Zungeru Hydro Electricity Dam revamping of the rail system to Zungeru would create many economic opportunities for the people.

Mallam Abubakar Yusuf Sadauki a tourist guide said the Zungeru rail station started deteriorating during the civilian administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999.

“Contractors handled the railway because it was handed over to the Indian Government. It was India that monitored the rail and served as contractors with their engineers. So when their contract time elapsed they left and handed it over to our indigenous engineers. Since then it has not been properly maintained” he said.

Sadauki said when the railway was functioning “it linked various villages around where there were no roads and there were a lot of economic activities. We had traders who came from Kano Kaduna on a train to buy things here in Zungeru. They also brought things for sale. People used to go to railway stations to buy things they wanted. Those who had what to sell also went there to sell and because of the rail station Zungeru became a multi-tribal town. There were a lot of tribes – Tiv Yoruba and many others. It was after the railway had collapsed that most of them left.”

A resident who identified himself as Mallam Abdullahi said: “When train was operating very well we farmers easily sold our farm produce without incurring transport expenses of taking them to far markets to sell. Our women also came to the station to sell foods such as yam kuli-kuli maize and several other foods and they gained a lot. In those days the station was always busy with people. But now it is empty because the train no longer operates as it used to.”

He added: “Trains don’t move every day. We don’t really know the exact day it operates now. We only take the train from time to time.”

According to him revamping the rail system would bring back the lost economic fortunes in the town. It would also create direct and indirect jobs for people.

Another resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity noted that the good days of train operation brought bounties to families in Zungeru and communities within.

“In those days women in particular came to sell foods here and it helped them and their families a lot. They used to sell food to travellers. But now that is no longer happening. Twenty years ago if you came to this Zungeru rail station you would see people as if it was a marketplace. The activities were booming. Some people were working as labourers to earn a living. But all these are no longer happening. This has affected the economic development of our people.“

Offa surviving on epileptic operations

Built by the British Government in 1896 the Offa railway station used to be alive with diverse economic activities.

Findings by our correspondent indicated that passengers who used to travel to the northern and southern parts of the country flocked the facility which also served as huge tourism potential for the country. But that is not longer the case as the once iconic structure has almost become desolate.

Its epileptic operation has drastically affected patronage as passengers continue to groan under worsening services that most times lead to additional expenses and waste of time.

Recently some hoodlums set an abandoned couch ablaze at the Ilorin office due to alleged poor service.

The National General Secretary of Offa Descendants Union (ODU) Muideen Ibrahim lamented the effects of the crisis on the economic activities of the people of the town.

Ibrahim a former regular rail traveller who recalled the good old days of train operation with nostalgia told Daily Trust Saturday that before now Offa being a major railway centre and a cosmopolitan town used to be a centre of economic political and tourism activities because of the presence of the railway station.

“The rail got to Offa very early. The train used to have a stopover here spending hours. That opportunity attracted patronage from most of the surrounding towns and villages as people would first come to book their tickets before coming for their actual boarding time. Some of them used to come a day earlier and sleep in nearby hotels to the extent that a lot of people made fortunes from the situation” he said.

“Economically and socially it was a fantastic place with various activities which allowed trade commerce hotels and other recreational centers to spring up. As a result there was the railway recreational clubs that hosted sports like table and lawn tennis. There was no musician that was worth his salt then that did not stage a show or played at the club. They included the like of the late Sikiru Ayinde Barrister Kolawole Kollington Sir Shina Peters King Sunny Ade and the late Ayinla Omowura. There were so many food joints and the station was bubbling” he said.

Ibrahim said with the passage of time the fortunes had nosedived leading to near total collapse until now that the present government is trying to resuscitate the system.

He called on government to ensure it accelerates the construction of the new railway system to return Offa’s status as a major train stopover centre.

An indigene of Offa who does not want his name in print said passengers are now reluctant to use the service because of the epileptic service.

“The problem we are having in Offa is that we still use the old rail line with its epileptic operation. For instance the last train that moved on Tuesday broke down in Minna and some of the passengers have to board vehicles to Kaduna” he said.

“The epileptic service has really affected the patronage and increased passenger’s apathy. In the olden days when there was smooth operation the economy of the place and the vicinity bubbled as different. Vendors make a lot of money here. It was indeed a thriving commerce” he added.

Efforts to get the response of the PRO of the station Mr Taiwo was not successful but an official Mr Yusuf Suleiman said the construction of the standard gauge would change the dwindling fortunes for the better.

“What we still have in Offa is the narrow gauge. The standard gauge has not gotten to us and that will change a lot of things as we are witnessing in other places where the standard gauge is now operating like the Lagos-Ibadan Abuja-Kaduna among others.”

The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) said it is doing its best to bring back the old glory of the railway with the revitalization of the railway networks across the country.

The Managing Director Engr. Fidet Okhiria told Daily Trust Saturday in a chat that there were improvements in stations across the country lately.

He disclosed that the corporation rehabilitates one or two stations annually.

“We still maintain the old stations. Every year we take some and maintain. In Kano we did some improvements. If you go to Kano now we have just re-roofed it” Okhiria said.

“On the eastern line most of the stations would be remodelled as part of the contract for reconstruction of the narrow gauge there. The stations would have to be remodeled” he added.

He said the good old days of the railway stations would return and economic activities rejuvenated as activities on the railway line improve.

“We run Lagos-Kano train every week and we also do freight. So we are trying to get to Enugu on our own before March before the reconstruction starts” he said.

Daily Trust on Sunday reports that the railway had been moribund for more than a decade before it was revived during the Goodluck Jonathan’s administration with the rehabilitation of the abandoned Lagos-Kano narrow gauge which was later revived.

Also the Lagos-Ogun intercity commuter train was revived with over 10000 passengers who travel daily from Ijoko in Ogun State to Apapa Lagos.

The NRC operations were further bolstered by the commencement of standard gauge services in Abuja-Kaduna Itakpe-Warri and Lagos-Ibadan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vZmFzdC1yaXNpbmcta2Fubnl3b29kLXN0YXJzLXRvLXdhdGNoLW91dC1mb3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fast-rising Kannywood stars to watch out for,"Northern Nigeria’s film industry Kannywood is filled with talented actors and actresses who hold promises to grace the screens this year.

Northern Nigeria’s film industry Kannywood is filled with talented actors and actresses who hold promises to grace the screens this year. The Hausa-language movie industry through which a majority of northern Nigerians dominantly experience cinema home videos and even Hausa music has an array of relatively new faces worth anticipating as the year goes by. Daily Trust highlights a few of those artistes

Daddy Hikima

Hikima whose real name is Adam Abubakar Adam and also known as Abale is a young actor from Kano who is fast grabbing the attention of audiences.

The young man is a registered nurse who has shelved his nursing career to dedicate better time and attention to his growing career in the industry.

DJ Cuppy lands new job at BBC

Hikima in an interview with BBC Hausa said he originally joined the industry as a backstage member in a continuity crew.

Known and admired for his thuggish roles he has carved a niche for himself with successful movies such as A Duniya Labarina Farin Wata Iyyali Na among others.

Last year he was awarded the “Kannywood Actor of the Year 2021” by 360 Hausa Recognition Awards and it is evident that there are good chances of seeing more of him as this year goes by.

Ummi Rahab

Rahab is often praised as the youngest star in the industry. The 18-year-old pretty lady started her acting career at the age of 10 when she featured in the movie ‘Ummi’ in 2014 alongside Adam A. Zango and Jamila Nagudu.

Born and brought up in Kaduna State the actress has been seen in a number of movies and her acting skills are quite acclaimed. She is noticeably very active on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok thus fast gaining the attention she needs as an ambitious actress.

Momee Gombe

Maimuna Abubakar is popularly known as Momee Gombe. The charismatic young woman started her career in the industry as a dancer and had been noticed for her dancing skills before she began taking up proper acting roles.

She has appeared in some movies including Kishin Mata and Asalin Kauna.

In 2019 she was featured in Hamisu Breaker’s ‘Jarumar Mata’ music video the video that became the biggest hit song of 2020 in the Hausa-speaking northern Nigeria.

Aisha Izzar-So

Aisha Najamu got the nickname ‘Izzar-So’ from a popular ongoing YouTube series by Bakori TV Izzar So in which she’s a strong lead character.

Najamu in the melodrama-like series has demonstrated not only her talent but also the readiness to be a force to reckon with in Kannywood.

With roles in several movies since after Izzar So she is recently becoming one of the most sought-after actresses in the industry.

Yusuf Saseen

Yusuf Muhammad Abdullahi fondly addressed as Yusuf Saseen in Kannywood was born and raised in Kano.

He started acting in 2017 when he starred in a movie titled ‘Charbi’ but his stardom began when he was featured in a popular seasonal show Labarina by a northern Nigerian-based television channel Arewa24 in which he acted a favourable role.

Saseen is among the few upcoming Kannywood actors with the proven potential to ring louder bells this year.

Aisha Humaira

Aisha Ahmad Idris is popularly known as Aisha Humaira after acting in the movie Humaira where she played the role of Aisha.

After starring in many successful movies including Hafeez Humaira Sirrin Dake Raina Zainul Abideen Ciwon Idanuna Ana Barin Halak and Wutar Kara it is evident that Humaira is in Kannywood for a strong purpose.

She joined Kannywood in 2018 with as much talent as her energy. The young lady who grew up in Kano made a bang when she was featured as a lead character in the movie Hafeez alongside veteran singer and actor Umar M. Sheriff. Since then she continues to glamorise not only on Instagram but on the big screens.

She’s surely one of the actresses to anticipate this year.

Shamsu Dan Iya

Mentored by the biggest actor in Kannywood Ali Nuhu Shamsu Dan Iya came into the industry almost fully made.

The 32-year-old actor from Kaduna has already established both his name and presence in the industry with films such as Sareena Gamu Nan Dai Mujadala Jaruma among others.

The young man is also a director and producer of movies and he exudes vibrant energy in all.

Professor Ango Abdullahi is the chairman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF). The onetime vice chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria and former special adviser to President Olusegun Obasanjo on Food Security spoke to Trust TV on his early days how he became the vice chancellor of the ABU at 40 as well as other interesting matters.

By Kabiru A Yusuf

You said that in those days you were virtually captured and taken to school; how did that happen?

In those years our people referred to western education as boko – makarantan boko so children were virtually conscripted by community leaders and sent to primary schools. And my father being a village head was required to provide a number of school children from his own area to go to a primary school in Kaya not even in his own village of administration Yakawada. He wanted to set an example by picking from his family members out of where there was a cousin of mine the son of his elder sister who was at the correct school age. So he got him into the list of others coming from other villages that he would submit to the district head and eventually will be taken to Kali Elementary School.

His children my elder brothers were two at the time but they were beyond the age of going to elementary school so he couldn’t have possibly picked anyone of them. He therefore picked my cousin who was completely under his care because his elder sister had died and he had brought her children. So he took it for granted that he could do this without any insinuation coming from any quarters.

Soon after the insinuations started coming that he took his sister’s son to boko and refused to take his own blood children; and he heard it. Then I was only six years old.

It really offended him and he knew where the comments were coming from. All he did was to say I should go to elementary school at that age of 6. It was mid 1940s. It was strange because I was yet to even be circumcised.

Of course my mother reacted; she was very angry and asked “Why should this child be taken away from home to an elementary school 11 miles away?” He said this was his decision and that is the way it had to be.

But fortunately somewhere along the line the wife of the primary school teacher was a younger sister to my mother so they tried to persuade my mother to understand that “this child is going to your sister to be looked after just like you are going to look after him here so you don’t need to worry.” She still didn’t want to agree.

In any case decisions at that time hardly challenged so I was taken off to elementary school together with my cousin who was then mature enough to go to school. That’s how we got captured.

I was virtually whisked away from my mother.

So I went to my aunt who was the wife of the elementary school teacher. After spending one year I was brought back home for the ritual of circumcision. I had my circumcision at the age of seven and went back to school.

Your education started under those circumstances but it proceeded so well that you were one of the first set of northern secondary school students to go to Ibadan to do your first degree. I believe this was in the late 1950s or early 1960s. Is that correct?

It is true. I went to secondary school in the early 1950s. In fact it was really coincidental or destiny. When I was six even before coming back at the age of seven for my circumcision I was already branded by the teacher who happened to be the husband of my aunt as yaro da gari. The reason was simply because when the older boys were challenged to answer some questions in the classroom and they could not he would say “Yaro da gari come and answer this question.”

Were you the youngest in the class?

Yes. And of course it had very difficult consequences for me. The teacher was pleased with me and would yell at the older students and so on. The consequence of that was that during break outside the classroom I got a lot of beatings from those who perhaps considered themselves to have been disgraced by the teacher on account of my answering these questions.

At some point when I found out that I was beaten constantly because I answered questions I declined answering the questions.

I would say “I don’t know.” That was how I saved myself from being beaten by older students.

Incidentally I did not complete primary education in Kaya; I did that in Giwa. The new Giwa was just finishing a primary school so my father decided that it was nearer to Kaya so I was transferred to Giwa Elementary School in my final year. From there I passed the exams to come to Zaria Middle School. At that time from elementary school you would go to middle school; then from middle school if you passed your exam you would go to secondary school.

This was Government College Kaduna?

Government College Zaria which was later renamed Berewa College.

How were you selected to go to Ibadan? It was the only university then and I imagine it was very competitive to get space from the North.

That is true. The problem is that there were very few northerners in the secondary school system at the time. In 1950 there were only two government secondary schools in northern Nigeria; Government College Zaria that moved from Kaduna College to its permanent site in Zaria as Government College Zaria; and a new one was just to be started in Keffi – Government College Keffi. These were the two government secondary schools in northern Nigeria around 1950.

About that time the Nigerian College of Arts Science and Technology was created in three places; Zaria Ibadan and Enugu. It was from secondary school results – West African School Certificate results – that students who qualified for post-secondary education were taken to either directly to the University College Ibadan to do preliminary studies or could go to the Nigerian College of Arts Science and Technology in the case of those of us in Zaria.

That was how we qualified to go to the Nigerian College of Arts Science and Technology to do our A levels after school certificate. Those who were successful moved to degree programmes at the University College Ibadan.

How was life for you in Ibadan as a young northerner; was it really difficult?

The point is that when some of us arrived in Ibadan of course people were asking questions. They didn’t believe we could be qualified enough from the North to come to the University College Ibadan. It was not even University of Ibadan yet because it was a college of the University of London so those of us who got admission into it eventually ended up with degrees from the University of London not University College Ibadan.

When we got to Ibadan the student population in 1960 was 2400 total. And the total number of northern students was less than 400. Most of them came from northern provinces rather than Kano Katsina Zaria and so on. Most of the students that qualified after A-levels in Zaria were from Kabba Plateau you know. It was Saurdana’s North whether one came from Sokoto or Gboko wherever it was.

In Ibadan in 1961 we found some of our elders who were seniors; some of them were just finishing – people like Garba Ja Abdulkadir Chief Sunday Awoniyi Adamu Ciroma. Few of them who were ahead of us in the Nigerian College of Arts Science and Technology like Iya Abubakar had finished.

Was life difficult or did you blend and make friends?

Coming from Zaria and a rural background as I did of course we were okay in some respect. The Nigerian College of Arts Science and Technology population was not substantially different from the mix I found in Ibadan because the students there were from all over Nigeria. We had the mix of all the major tribes and so on. We made friends with them. Of course we were in different departments. At the college there was a degree in engineering but it was affiliated to the University of London. There were professional courses like fine arts architecture and so on. There were students from all over Nigeria so it wasn’t extremely difficult to get the correct mix. But in the course I picked to study there were only five of us from the North – myself a very close friend of mine Senator Jibrin who passed away last year; Pwajok from Plateau Ibukunle from Offa.

Things were not as easy as that.It is difficult to describe it.

This was Agriculture right?

Yes.

Was there discrimination?

Well the politics of the country reflected in the population of students in Ibadan because the moment you came out of your hall in the morning you would see newspapers laid out for you to buy if you wished or you could read and go to classes. From the headlines you would know papers that were from which part of Nigeria.

I would like to emphasize that I don’t mean any disrespect but some of my lecturers were clearly discriminatory.

I remember how one of them one day he came quietly from behind and removed my cap when I was doing my practical in his laboratory. You know our mode of dressing as northerners: kaftan with caps. He took it off from my head and threw it out of the window and said “Look my father is a traditional ruler I have a dress just like your own so you don’t come to my class with caps.”

Months or years later we tried to find out who he really was and realised that he came from a strong traditional rulership background which was very close to the hot politics of those days in western Nigeria – the Action Group. So you see clearly that there was a lot of politicking that reflected the larger society.

Most of us left Zaria as radical Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) boys but when we got to Ibadan and found that our names were hardly called we were only called Malam we had no choice but to form the NPC club. The secretary of the NPC club is still alive Ambassador Guzabe. We were very active in the politics of the campus and that of the country.

Fortunately for us there was crisis between Chief S.N. Akintola and his former boss Chief Awolowo. He was in charge of the radio so any time we had an article for the NPC club in the university they would air it and the campus would say we were making so much noise.

We realised that whether you said you were different from the NPC or not you were definitely Hausa-Fulani.

So the experience there made you more conservative?

Well it was more of change of attitude in some respects because of politics and our background in the North. Many of us came from traditional homes and so on. People like Bala Usman a friend of mine MD. Yusuf and so on were radical politicians and you could see that in many homes.

We saw politics as an opportunity to exchange views and ideas; and these views and ideas were going to serve the interest of the public. A guide to this philosophy was no other person than a young political leader Mallam Aminu Kano. That is why there was this aggregation of young people in the young NEPU club.

But things began to look different as we saw politics played largely on the basis of where you came from – your ethnic background and so on. The comments that usually came from newspapers reflected these biases.

So there is nowhere to run to; you just have to adjust your inkling at least for that moment so that people will understand that your adjustment is to indicate that things cannot be done without reason. There must be a good reason why somebody will just set his mind against a people.

Most people thought that many of us went to Ibadan because Saurdana forced it. This was in spite of the fact that in the classes and in the discipline where we were pursuing we had very bright students: Iya Abubakar made first class honours Jibril Aminu took virtually five of the six final medical exam prices.

When you finished you came back and took up a job in Zaria at the Institute of Agriculture Research. It seems you had a fair career in Zaria – you were an officer and became a director of the institute deputy vice chancellor and vice chancellor rather quickly. It looks very fairytale.

I sometimes look at it that way because I think I became a vice chancellor at the age of 39 or 40. You see only four of us graduated from the University of Ibadan in 1964 and when we arrived in Kaduna there were government vehicles waiting for northerners coming from Ibadan with degrees. And of course the government was aware of our scholarships. Each one was known to study XYZ and each one was taken to the appropriate ministry straight away.

I was taken to Ministry of Agriculture. The permanent secretary at that time was Mohammed Lawani from Maiduguri. When I got in he said “Well you just finished from Ibadan congratulations; we saw your result and you are going to Samaru.”

But going to Samaru in some way meant that I was being posted to the ABU which was an independent institution. It hired its own staff; the government did not recruit for it. So because of the creation of the Ahmadu Bello University and the Institute for Agriculture Research one’s professional background had been absorbed. And we didn’t want to lose that link between the products of research and the applications of products of research on the farms.

So we created a new unit based in Samaru called Agriculture Research Liaison Section belonging to the ministry. It didn’t belong to the university. And that was where you would go as a ministry staff posted to Samaru and housed in the Institute for Agriculture Research but your main job was to keep an eye on research results interpreting them for the benefit of extension workers who were working with farmers.

The unit was new and one of my seniors Mallam Yaro Zaidu was one of them. There was Professor Alazi from Benue Malam Ahmed Jema a chemist who was from Bauchi. There was a Sierra Leonean who was then the head of the unit Mr Parry.

Our job was not to become research officers but to become interpreters of research for the purpose of field work to advice extension staff agricultural officers agriculture superintendents and so on who were working directly for the ministry.

The then Northern Nigerian Government paid so much attention to agriculture development. In fact the whole country was dependent on agriculture; that was why those of us who worked virtually toured every village in the North for the purpose of promoting agriculture.

That was my first posting when I arrived in 1964. I have dual bosses: one directly in my unit and the other one the head of the Institute for Agriculture Research who eventually took care of the research responsibility of the institute. At the same time he reported to the government in terms of the benefits of the research for the purpose of agriculture development in northern Nigeria.

That was where we stayed for two years then the 1966 coup came and we lost our parents leaders political leaders and so on. Things began to change everywhere including the ABU.

When Ironsi arrived with his secretary to the government I think he was Nwokede they immediately sacked the vice chancellor of the university.

Which university?

Ahmadu Bello.

Was that Alexander?

Exactly he was recruited from the University of Ibadan Department of Physics to become the Vice chancellor of the ABU. After the coup Ironsi’s government decided he should leave the country.

Was he British?

No he was a New Zealander. And there were two Igbo senior lecturers in the Department of Engineering. I told you that the Nigerian college was running an engineering programme on behalf of the University of Ibadan for the University of London so quickly they started to lobby. One of them was to replace Alexander.

Of course Mabede who was the chairman of Council together with his colleagues Labanbaki Ahmed Coommasie etc said the university belonged to northern Nigeria and every employee of the university including the vice chancellor was the employee of the Council and nobody consulted them when Alexander was removed so they did not agree.

I think Gen Hassan told us that a decision had been taken since it was a military government. As a military man he was already appointed as the governor of the northern provinces because the North was already being converted to provinces.

They said no ‘we don’t agree but if he has to leave we are going to appoint a new vice chancellor ourselves we don’t accept any appointment from anywhere else.’ These were principled people and leaders. And Hassan agreed.

At that time to be honest to you the most senior persons with academic qualification to teach in the university were two or three including Ishaya Audu. I met him in Zaria and he went to University of Lagos. At some point in fact he was the personal physician of Saurdana.

Then Professor Iya Abubakar had just returned from Cambridge with his PhD in Physics or Mathematics. And with that basic qualification you would start from lecturer 2 .

Then there was one Mallam Balarabe; I think he was from Funtua. He was also teaching Mathematics when we were doing our A-level. I can say he was qualified to teach in the university.

That was how Ishaya Audu eventually emerged. They asked who they had and they sent for Audu to come from Lagos. They constituted a Council meeting. He was waiting outside and after a few minutes they brought him in and said ‘You are appointed VC of Ahmadu Bello University.’

How were you appointed as vice chancellor?

I was telling you about the transition from the ministry to the university. We have since converted into a research institute.

You had done your master’s and PhD?

I had done master’s and so on.

Was your appointment dramatic; how did it happen?

No; I became the deputy director of the institute at some point; and when Obasanjo decided to post vice chancellors to universities it was total aberration. They did not go through the process of normal appointment of vice chancellors which is usually stated in the law of each university.

Not through the Council?

He posted Prof Akinkunmi who was teaching medicine in Ibadan. Of course he became the vice chancellor of the University of Ilorin through the normal procedures. He took the late Mahmud Tukur to the University of Lagos. Tukur said he was not going because Lagos did not invite him to be VC. He refused to go and he brought Ezelor to Kano.

When Prof Akinkunmi eventually settled down in Zaria after two or three months a telephone call came to the institute that the vice chancellor wanted to see me.

Were you a deputy director or director?

I was a director. When I went he said “Ango I didn’t teach you in Ibadan but I taught your friends — Prof Musa Jubri Aminu and the rest of them.” He taught them medicine he is a cardiologist like Jubri Aminu.

He said “I have settled down in the university now I know who is who and I have called you to ask whether you will agree to be the deputy vice chancellor to work with me.”

I said “It is a great honour that out of so many of us equals professors heads of departments deans I could be so recognised I am particularly grateful thank you very much sir. But sir I want to ask for a little time to go and consult with my staff in the institute because this is the largest research institute; in fact the largest institute in the university. I need to know the implication of sharing my time between the main campus and the institute. So I want you to permit me to go and discuss this with my colleagues then I will come back and give you an answer.” And he said that was very good.

That was the excuse I gave. There were other reasons but I felt I needed more time to consult. So I called colleagues including Bala Usman and the rest of them and said “I am invited by the VC to be his deputy what do you think?”

It was a debate. Some said yes while some said no but at the end of the day the yes had it because they said if I did not accept there would be consequences for the university.

So I accepted and reported to him. He said “You have a tradition of two deputy vice chancellors but I have a tradition of only one so that the command structure is very clear. You will be one deputy vice chancellor.” That was how I accepted to be deputy VC sharing my time between the institute and the main campus.

The university remained turbulent because of Obasanjo’s decision to post vice chancellors rather than allow universities to choose them.

You know the ABU is a hot spot so things didn’t go well. The VC was not at ease with the events and the students and staff were getting organised so riot broke out.

I was in Zaria visiting Berewa College for an assignment then we saw smoke at Samaru and I told Babaro that it was from the main campus and we should go back. We went back and found out that the campus was virtually on fire.

As deputy vice chancellor I started looking for my VC. I phoned everywhere I knew I could get him but I couldn’t find him. Eventually when I got him I said I was worried about his safety.

Later there was some arrangement for security to take him to Ilorin or Ibadan. Obasanjo had already arranged for his evacuation back home.

The chairman of Council came down and said that since the VC had actually abdicated we should re-designate acting VC. So I was referred to as acting VC. And that was the beginning of the work for me.

Was there opposition to your promotion?

No at all. The Council was pleased and gave me instruction for advert to be put out for recruiting a new vice chancellor which is perfectly the procedure. We did it with the registrar and adverts were put out and people started to apply.

After about weeks the registrar reviewed the applications that had arrived and they did not see my name because I did not apply. So the word got out that acting VC did not show interest so some of my friends and colleagues started to worry me and said I had not applied I said I was not interested.

When I was invited to be deputy VC I was very reluctant because I was enjoying my job as research officer and fellow. I refused to apply. So they said I had to apply but I said I would not.

So by coincidence at that time my own university was due so while Ibrahim was registrar he came to me and he said he wanted me as VC and I said for what? He said the Council asked him for some people to show interest and some people suggested your name. I told him even here in ABU I have not applied. I am not interested so I refused to apply.

Pressure mounted for me to apply but I was not really keen in all this; I would rather do my work in the field as an agric man based on my research. Time was running out and I still refused to apply. Pressure by many of my professor friends and so on kept mounting.

About seven weeks to the end of the advert I asked how many candidates we had gotten. He said seven or six from inside and one from outside. He was very polite and said “We still haven’t seen your name yet.”

So within that period some of my colleagues decided that they should use a provision in the law which allows for a search party to go round and see whether there are some people who deserved to be on the list that have not applied if they could be persuaded to apply. So they came to me and I had not applied.

What they did was to write an application letter on my behalf and dropped it in the box. When I saw them three days later they started laughing around me and said my name was in that box and I said it could be with my handwriting. How did you get my CV?

They said we had CV for your promotion to principal research fellow which is usual a thing for professors or principal research fellow; ”that is what we used and you are a candidate” and that was it. But even then I tried to wriggle out since I was not the one who applied and everybody knew I did not apply.

I decided that the registrar should call for an emergency meeting of the Senate. He sent me the notice and asked for the agenda and I said when they come I would tell them.

When the registrar came I said I called for the emergency meeting to inform you that it was not out of disrespect for them in the institution that I did not apply to be vice chancellor although I agreed to be the deputy vice chancellor. I didn’t feel I needed to continue to stay because I didn’t apply.

But I understood that I was a candidate by virtue of the procedure that allowed for people to be nominated. My contention is that universities existed because of senior academics especially the Senate that is the apex organ of any university.

I said I wanted another Senate meeting but the CV of all the candidates should be distributed to all of them

Aliyu did this and I gave him one week to study the CVs and so that would have another Senate meeting.

What was the outcome?

They did everybody dropped his name and I told Aliyu who is the chief returning officer to get in and count with his assistance. And he counted. So he said “Here is the vote” and I said ‘go ahead and announce.’ – Ango Abdullahi (74) the next person to me Prof Umoru Gumwak (18) Abdulkamino Prof. Musa Sule Kumo Prof. Nuhu and so on 5 6 7 8. Then I knew this was their choice. I was the first among equals.",,,

While the system was handed over in December last year the delivery was revealed earlier this week.

The Army’s Project Director Sensors-Aerial Intelligence (PD SAI) plans to build three LRR-E systems and install them onto three airborne reconnaissance low-enhanced (ARL-E) aircraft. The first LRR-E system was delivered in April 2018 and a third system is expected to be delivered mid- to late-2022.

The ARL-E is a manned aerial ISR suit of equipment integrated into de Havilland Canada-8 (DHC-8) aircraft designed for support to tactical forces of the full spectrum of operations. It provides a persistent capability to include broad-area surveillance and/or focused stare on target areas of interest (point or objective targets) electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR)/full-motion video (FMV) multi-mode radar robust communications intelligence (COMINT) onboard collection analysis sensor cross cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) enabled workstations.

The LRR-E is capable of detecting moving targets using two types of moving target indications (MTIs). Ground moving target indications (GMTIs) are used to scan for larger types of targets such as vehicles while dismount moving target indications (DMTI) focus on smaller targets like people.

“While scanning an area the operator will see dots overlaid on a map that registers the target’s location” said Bryan Farley LRR Lead for Program Manager Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (PM MARSS). “Using radar cross section (RCS) indication the operator can determine how big a target might be how reflective it might be and how fast it may be going.”

The LRR-E is also capable of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) a separate mode of the radar which provides three dimensional radio frequency spectrum representation of the physical environment. This allows the operator to see a terrain through the lens of a radar.

The LRR-E is based off the vehicle and dismount exploitation radar (VADER). While VADER uses a Ku-band radio frequency the LRR-E uses an X-band frequency. This allows the LRR-E to produce much longer detection ranges than VADER.

Another feature that makes the LRR-E unique is that the antenna is not mechanically swept. Unlike some other radars within the PD SAI portfolio such as the small tactical radar lightweight (STARLite) the LRR-E does not use a gimbaled antenna.

“This change provides a few purposes” Farley said. “Because they are mechanical gimbals tend to break. If there are fewer parts on a sensor that can break fewer parts will need to be replaced. It also allows operators to place their beams wherever they want instantaneously.”

“Compared to VADER the LRR-E pod is 3.5 feet longer and weights more than twice as much” said Matt Perry ARL-E Assistant Product Manager. “Since the ARL-E is a bigger platform compared to other platforms within the PD SAI portfolio it is able to handle the bigger LRR-E sensor.”

Designed to be rapidly reconfigurable allowing for five different sensor configurations the ARL-E provides the combatant commander the ability to customize the sensor package for specific missions as needed.

PD SAI anticipates integrating the LRR-E into the first ARL-E spring 2022 with flight-testing to begin this summer. PD SAI is also investigating applicability of the LRR-E for future platforms as well as in support of the multi-domain operations (MDO) environment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZ3JlYXQtcmVzcG9uc2liaWxpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Great responsibility,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/great-responsibility/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZ3JlYXQtcmVzcG9uc2liaWxpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyYW5kZm9ya3NoZXJhbGQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZ3JhbmQtc2t5LWxvb2tzLXRvLWZ1dHVyZS1ncm93dGgtaW4tMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grand Sky looks to future growth in 2022,"GRAND FORKS – On the list of new things to watch for this year at Grand Sky an unmanned aerial systems business and aviation complex is the possibility of additional tenants.

Grand Sky located on 217 acres at the Grand Forks Air Force Base provides space for Northrop Grumman and General Atomics but the complex could see up to three newcomers in 2022 according to Grand Sky President Thomas Swoyer.

The primary area that Grand Sky is developing is around a 17-acre piece of concrete that used to have bombers on it and he said more recently KC-135 tankers. The site has attracted Northrop and General Atomics both aerospace and defense technology companies.

“Now we're starting to attract some other groups as well” Swoyer said. “We went from zero to just under 190 employees who report there every day.”

This past fall Grand Sky celebrated the opening of its new 18000-square-foot Multi-Tenant Building 1 which will support future growth at the site. The facility’s tenants include General Atomics InnoVets Aerospace Grand Sky Airfield Operations and the Northern Plains UAS Test Site’s Vantis the statewide Beyond Visual Line of Site network.

“Grand Sky is the place to be for all things UAS and this new expansion which is already fully leased proves just that” Sen. John Hoeven said in a statement at the time of the grand opening in October. “The multi-tenant building enables companies of all sizes to be part of the incredible UAS ecosystem we’ve worked to develop in Grand Forks.”

Grand Sky received support from the state of North Dakota which through the Department of Commerce appropriated money to invest in infrastructure at the complex. The tenant buildings are privately funded. To date the state has spent $21.5 million on Grand Sky with another $7 million ready to spend Swoyer said. The private sector has put $90 million into the complex.Swoyer said he expects growth to continue. “We've got a bunch of other companies that have raised their hand and expressed interest in having smaller footprints but footprints nonetheless out at Grand Sky” he said. “I expect two or three new companies to sign up and be out there over this next year with construction starting on one or maybe even two of their facilities. I think that'll continue to grow.”

Nothing yet has been signed regarding additional tenants but he said there also continues to be expansion efforts by General Atomics and Northrop Grumman.

“I get the question a lot: ‘How many more tenants are you going to have?’ But every time we turn around General Atomics and Northrop Grumman keep taking more space” Swoyer said. “That's great that they continue to invest in the community that they continue to find value in operating in Grand Forks because frankly for their businesses it is a great value. And so they keep expanding their programs. It changes the ebb and flow a little bit but we can work with that and it's great to see them growing at Grand Sky.”

Northrop Grumman said the Grand Sky facility is especially important to its development prototyping production and testing of military aircraft systems both manned and unmanned. From conducting Firebird flight operations to supporting the Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center task order to reconfigure four EQ-4 Block 20 Global Hawk aircraft to be used for the SkyRange program.

“Grand Sky’s 35000-square-foot state-of-the-art hangar is an ideal location to undertake the system modifications necessary to optimize the Global Hawks for the SkyRange mission” said Jane Bishop vice president and general manager global surveillance Northrop Grumman. “The SkyRange program encapsulates Global Hawk’s core abilities – high-altitude long-endurance with extensive mission and system flexibility.”

Mike Fridolfs site director at Grand Sky Northrop Grumman said there are a lot of talented people at the Grand Forks site who help to turn enterprising ideas into innovative reality. Northrop Grumman welcomes interns and full-time employees through partnerships with University of North Dakota and Northland Community & Technical College. According to Northrop because of this patronage North Dakota will have a continued role to play not only in building its high-tech industry forward but also in shaping the future of autonomous air.

“The talent we have in North Dakota allows us to be successful in the state. Areas of work include engineering research and software development pilot operator and maintainer training along with operations and mission analysis and ultimately aircraft maintenance” Fridolfs said. “Our commitment to helping place students and graduates in the local unmanned aerial system industry remains steadfast.""

Additional developments at Grand Sky this year may include weather monitoring capabilities improved security to better support tenants and using drones to deliver lunches to people at the complex. Swoyer said the latter will be in preparation for other types of drone deliveries in the future.

The United States has “a lot of catching up to do very quickly” US Space Force Gen. David Thompson told CNN after weapons tests by China and Russia took US national security officials by surprise in recent months — and after the American military suffered two catastrophic test failures in 2021.

The highly maneuverable weapons fly at speeds in excess of Mach 5 five times the speed of sound — posing a dangerous threat to missile defense systems.

The Pentagon’s virtual meeting set for Feb. 3 aims to “light a fire underneath the entire hypersonic industry” according to executives at two of the dozen defense contractors — including Boeing Raytheon and Northrop Grumman — that have been invited to attend.

In October American military officials sounded the alarm after China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile warning that the Chinese Communist Party will soon surpass American military capability.

Relativity Space Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit were awarded the fixed-price indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contracts for Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare (VADR) missions which have a five-year ordering period.

“We are incredibly excited to announce the awardees for VADR from a broad range of established and emerging launch providers and launch service aggregators and brokers” said Bradley Smith director of launch services at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “This speaks to our expertise in understanding the launch market as we crafted VADR to maximize our efforts in enabling a growing U.S launch industry.”

The fact that Long Beach companies make up 25% of the new contracts speaks to the city’s recent emergence as a hub for space travel and exploration. Other firms include ABL Space Systems Astra Space Blue Origin Florida L2 Solutions Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation Spaceflight Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and United Launch Services according to NASA’s announcement.

“This contract award is a great step forward for commercial space” Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said in a statement. Virgin already has launched 13 satellites into orbit for NASA through the agency’s Venture Class Launch Services (VCLS) program and the CubeSat Launch Initiative.

The VADR contracts will result in the delivery of payloads ranging from cubesats to less complex low-priority Class D missions to a variety of orbits NASA stated. The payloads of these missions will serve as a platform for technical and architecture innovation as part of NASA’s science research and technology development the agency said.

“We are absolutely thrilled to be selected by NASA to support VADR missions” Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck said in a statement. “NASA’s Launch Services program plays a crucial role in growing the U.S. launch industry by ensuring resilient space access and we could not be prouder to play a role in that.”

In 2018 Rocket Lab deployed 13 educational satellites for NASA through its VCLS. The latest contract joins a growing list of future launches the company is handling for NASA including the CAPSTONE mission to the moon and the ESCAPADE mission to mars.

Though it does not have a single launch under its belt Relativity Space—a firm that is in the testing phase of its fully 3D-printed Terran 1 and Terran R rockets—already has contracts for numerous commercial and government entities. The firm is slated to launch NASA’s VCLS-2 mission later this year.

Relativity Space also is in the process of building out a massive new facility at the former Boeing C-17 manufacturing facility.

“With this new tool in our toolbox these tremendously flexible contracts will meet a wide variety of NASA science and technology needs” Smith stated “further enhancing the agency’s Launch Services Program’s reputation as Earth’s bridge to space.”"

Messenger Reporter

GRAPELAND – The Grapeland Chamber of Commerce hosted its Annual Awards Banquet on Thursday Jan. 27 and honored those who had helped to make Grapeland a better community over the past year.

Jaycee Graham

The event started with a catered dinner from El Toro featuring beef and chicken fajitas along with sides of rice and beans. For dessert attendees were treated to a scrumptious slice of cheesecake. Members of the Grapeland FFA were on hand to serve the dinner and did a wonderful job.

Vickie and Tom Gates

After dinner the awards portion of the banquet began.

Chamber President Amber Loew informed those in attendance about the various raffle items available and then provided the invocation. Following the prayer the Chamber President yielded the floor to Grapeland Mayor Mitchell Woody.

Daphne Session

The mayor kicked off the awards by presenting the Senior of the Year Award to GHS senior Jaycee Graham.

“I would just like to thank (GHS Principal) Mrs. (Katie) Doughty for making things fun and for letting me come to her office anytime. If there are any Grapeland seniors here just enjoy it because it goes by really fast” she said.

Ben Childress

The next award was the Good Neighbor Award.

“This award showcases the heart and soul of Grapeland and surrounding cities. We are dedicated to see these awards don’t go unnoticed. The Good Neighbor Award goes to Tom and Vickie Gates” the mayor said.

Rev. Broderick Hill

“The next Good Neighbor Award” Woody continued “goes to a very special woman. She is more than a mere elected official. She embodies heart mind and soul and serves as an inspiration as well as a role model. She cares about her community and embodies the phrase public service. No matter where you see her she carries with her a smile and a warm heart. You can find her visiting local churches as well as supporting various local community projects and businesses. We would like to present our next Good Neighbor Award to none other than (County Attorney) Daphne L. Session.”

Aaron Hatton

The next award was for the Church of the Year and Program of the Year which went to First Baptist Church of Grapeland which hosted the event. FBC has always been a rock upon which the community could depend on since its inception in 1891. The award was accepted by another Grapeland icon Mr. Ben Childress.

Business of the Year Salmon Lake Park

Following up on the Church of the Year Award the mayor presented the Pastor of the Year Award to Rev. Broderick Hill of Rising Star Baptist Church.

As the banquet continued Grapeland Police Officer Aaron Hatton was presented with the Serviceman of the Year Award. The Business of the Year Award was presented to Salmon Lake Park. The Chamber of Commerce Members of the Year Awards were presented to Nikki Steinsbo and Brandon Bridges for their tireless efforts in promoting the city of Grapeland.

Nikki Steinsbo and Brandon Bridges

A very special award followed as State Rep. Trent Ashby was honored.

“Trent we would like to thank you” Steinsbo said “because you always make a way. There are elected officials who come out for nothing more than to solicit votes but you come out to support us in many ways. I don’t think there is a time we have held any of our meager gatherings here in Grapeland that you didn’t show up to support us. I appreciate it and you’ve got my vote.”

State Rep. Trent Ashby

Once the state representative received his Choice Award Steinsbo continued at the dais.

“You make a living but what it is that you get but you make a life by what you give. Right now I want to thank and honor a very special lady to the Grapeland community. This lady has served the less fortunate in many ways. This lady walks like a boss. She talks like a boss. She has been known to take action when necessary and ruled certain situations with an iron fist. What stands out most however is that she loves her neighbor. This lady retired in 2021 with 45 years of service to the City of Grapeland. She retired at 90-years-young and I’m going to ask everyone in the room to stand and let’s give a round of applause to the beautiful Mrs. Wanda Nichols” Steinsbo said.

Wanda Nichols

As the award presentations started to wind down Woody returned to the podium to present the Humanitarian Award.

“According to the definition a humanitarian is one who seeks to promote human welfare. This is a caring person who often may participate in charity work to show they may care about you and others. This person will more than likely say they are undeserving of this award. We however believe otherwise. This last and final award will be presented a little differently. We have a few members of the Vulcraft team that will come up to share a few words. I would like to call up Jerome Simpson Tommy Taylor and Justin Wells to the podium” the mayor said.

Josh Wall

The three men extolled the virtues of their former boss Josh Wall and talked about his leadership in his role as the GM of Vulcraft. Emotions started to spill over as they talked about his qualities as a boss a man and as a friend.

Rep. Ashby returned to the stage to present Wall with the award and presented him with a Certificate of Recognition from the Texas State House of Representatives and a flag that was flown over the Texas Capital on Jan. 26.

“This is a surprise” Wall said. “The only thing that comes to mind is thank you. Thank you for some of the best years of my life. Thank you for being a home for me and my family. Thank you for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with me as we bring unity in the community. I love and miss you.”

Mitchell and Bobbie Jo Woody

Wall has recently taken a position in the North Texas area as Vice President and General Manager for Nucor’s Insulated Panel Group.

The last awards of the night were presented to Mitchell and Bobbi Jo Woody for their service to the community and for their efforts to make Grapeland a better place to live.

Once the awards were presented door prizes were awarded raffle tickets were drawn and the winners were presented with their prizes.

VRR enables the two to sync to prevent artifacts like tearing (where it looks like parts of different screens are mixed together) and stutter (where the screen updates at perceptibly irregular intervals). These efforts range from basic in-game frame rate control to pricey hardware-based implementations like Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate and AMD FreeSync Premium.

Which do you want?

When picking a monitor which VRR system to look for comes down to which graphics card you own -- especially now when you can't really buy a new GPU -- and which games you play plus the monitor specs and choices available. G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate and FreeSync Premium and Pro are mutually exclusive; you'll rarely (if ever) see variations of the same monitor with options for both. In other words every other decision you make pretty much determines which VRR scheme you get.

Basic VRR

Basic VRR enables games to use their own methods of syncing the two rates which on the PC frequently means the game just caps the frame rate it will allow. One step up from that is generic adaptive refresh rate which uses extended system-level technologies to vary the screen update rate based on the frame rate coming out of the game. This can deliver a better result than plain VRR as long as your frame rates aren't all over the place within a short span of time.

G-Sync Compatible and FreeSync

In the bottom tier of Nvidia and AMD's VRR technologies you'll find improved versions of adaptive refresh branded G-Sync Compatible and FreeSync. They use the GPU's hardware to improve VRR performance but they're hardware technologies that are common to both Nvidia and AMD GPUs which means you can use either supported by the monitor provided one manufacturer's graphics card driver allows you to enable it for the other manufacturer's cards. Unlike FreeSync though G-Sync Compatible implies Nvidia has tested the monitor for an ""approved"" level of artifact reduction.

G-Sync and FreeSync Premium

The first serious levels of hardware-based adaptive refresh are G-Sync and FreeSync Premium. They both require manufacturer-specific hardware in the monitor that works in conjunction with their respective GPUs in order to apply more advanced algorithms such as low-frame rate compensation (AMD) or variable overdrive (Nvidia) for better results with less performance overhead. They also have base thresholds for monitor specs that meet appropriate criteria. G-Sync still only works over a DisplayPort connection for monitors because it uses DisplayPort's Adaptive Sync however which is frustrating because it does work over HDMI for some TVs .

At CES 2022 Nvidia launched its next-generation 1440p G-sync Esports standard with Reflex Latency Analyzer (Nvidia's technology for minimizing lag of the combined keyboard mouse and display) and a 25-inch mode that can simulate that size display on a larger monitor. Normalizing high-quality 1440p 27-inch displays for esports is a great step up from 1080p and 25 inches. The initial monitors which will be supporting it (the ViewSonic Elite XG271QG AOC Agon Pro AG274QGM MSI MEG 271Q all with a 300Hz refresh rate and the Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG27AQN) haven't shipped yet.

Watch this: Nvidia's newest 3080 Ti GPU headlines Computex 2021 04:21

(Mini rant: This name scheme would make a monitor ""G-Sync Compatible-compatible"" so you'll see the base capability referred to as a ""G-Sync Compatible monitor."" That's seriously misleading because that means you're frequently called on to distinguish between uppercase and lowercase: G-Sync Compatible is not the same as G-Sync-compatible.)

G-Sync Ultimate and FreeSync Premium Pro

At the top of the VRR food chain are G-Sync Ultimate and FreeSync Premium Pro. They both require a complete ecosystem of support -- game and monitor in addition to the GPU -- and primarily add HDR optimization in addition to further VRR-based compensation algorithms.

The hardware-based options tend to add to the price of a monitor and whether or not you need or want them really depends upon the games you play -- if your games don't support these technologies it's kind of pointless to pay extra for them -- how sensitive you are to artifacts and how bad the disconnect is between your display and the gameplay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3doeS1udmlkaWFzLWJvdHRvbS11cC1hcHByb2FjaC10by10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLXdpbGwtd2luL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Nvidia's bottom-up approach to the metaverse will win,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/business/why-nvidias-bottom-up-approach-to-the-metaverse-will-win/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3doeS1udmlkaWFzLWJvdHRvbS11cC1hcHByb2FjaC10by10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLXdpbGwtd2luL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvY2hlYXQtc2hlZXQtbnZpZGlhLTMwLXNlcmllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cheat Sheet: Nvidia 30-series,"Nvidia graphics cards still dominate the laptop GPU landscape although AMD Radeon 6000  and soon Intel Arc  are doing their best to change that.

High-end gaming ray tracing: Nvidia GeForce RTX 30-Series

Currently at the top of the heap among Nvidia graphics cards is the RTX 30-series. Based on the latest Ampere architecture the 30-series pushes forward the impressive ray tracing technology introduced in the previous generation 20-series cards. Let’s take a look at the keys stats spanning seven SKUs. The top row is the GPU’s name higher numbers in the name indicate a more powerful card. Card names ending in “Ti” are superior to the non-Ti version of the same model number.

Nvidia 30-Series chart breakdown: For nerds and the curious

Nvidia CUDA cores are highly specialized processing units in Nvidia GPUs used by many programming languages to more easily leverage the compute power of the GPU which is already a very specialized component of any computer. These cores are tasked with doing lots of floating point math  a very compute-intensive process used in 3D rendering. A higher CUDA core count generally indicates a more capable GPU.

A GPU’s Boost Clock measured in megahertz is the performance speed of the GPU at its peak when under the heaviest workloads it can manage. A GPU can “boost” itself to a faster clock speed for a period of time while remaining within thermal and power thresholds for short-term intensive tasks. This is essentially the highest speed at which the processor clock that governs all tasks can output a signal or instruction. The RTX 3080 at its listed boosted performance can output up to 1.59 million instructions a second. You’ll notice lower number cards can have higher listed clock speeds but with fewer compute cores and less available memory the card still won’t outperform its bigger siblings.

The listed GPU “subsystem” power measured in Watts is the rated power draw range of the card which can fluctuate as demands on the system rise and fall. This can play a large role in laptop battery life .

The memory configuration indicates the available Video RAM measured in Gigabytes used to store information needed in the short-term. While your laptop has its own RAM modern GPUs require dedicated VRAM often of similar amounts to do their job. Larger VRAM pools allow a GPU to store graphical instruction data in a place where access speeds are many times faster than reading from your hard drive or SSD. A lower amount of VRAM means more (relatively) slow trips to the SSD to pull down that data. More VRAM is always better. All 30-series cards come with the latest memory standard known as GDDR6 (Graphical Double Data Rate for you acronym nerds) which has rated transfer speeds of 16Gb/s.

The Ray Tracing Cores and Tensor Cores are indicated here as the current generation of those processing units. Ray Tracing Cores help with the very intensive work of rendering ray traced effects on surfaces in games. Tensor cores are another specialized part of the GPU responsible for doing the relational math between vertices and matrices needed for modern 3D graphical effects and are a key component of AI systems like DLSS .

Nvidia 30-Series summary: For everyone else

Don’t worry if not all of that landed the major take away from this is that Nvidia has seven very powerful GPUs on the market and while each higher model number generally outperforms the one below it there are some quirks in the 30-series when it comes to processor speed. This means you might not need to drop the money on a top-of-the-line RTX 3080 Ti and should check performance reviews of specific configurations before deciding bigger is better.

(Image credit: Nvidia)

The RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti are your high-end options that shouldn’t run any modern game below 60 frames per second. Examples include the MSI GE76 Raider for a hefty $4199 equipped with a 3080 Ti and a shiny new 12th Gen Alder Lake Intel CPU if you feel like blowing the doors off of everything. In our tests it ran Red Dead Redemption 2 at 82 fps. Then at half the price there’s the Acer Nitro 5  pairing an AMD Ryzen 6 5900HX CPU with an RTX 3080 for $2300 that also performs very well running Assassin's Creed Odyssey at 64 FPS at 1080p resolution on Highest settings.

Down the ladder but still very capable are the RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti cards.You should expect a solid price cut without much of a performance dip out of 3070s. The Alienware m15 R4 ran Assassin’s Creed Odyssey at 67 fps (see?) at 1080p but you pay that Alienware premium in this case at $2499. Same game Gigabyte Aorus 15G  same settings: 64 fps. Not too bad for $1799 but with some quality of life caveats as indicated in the review.

Next up and formerly the lowest performing of the 30-series cards is the RTX 3060. Laptops with these won’t break fps category records but they shouldn’t break the bank either. If you don’t demand more than a comfortable 60 FPS to run your latest games at-or-near high settings a 3060 should do you just fine. On our deals page  RTX 3060 equipped laptops can be found from $1199 up to $1899.

Lastly in the 30-series line are the newly added entry level RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti cards. These guys should get you over the line at 60 FPS unless you’re running a particularly taxing game at especially high settings. With fewer compute cores than the big boys the 3050s still have fast enough clock speeds to mean business. The best part about them of course is the price. RTX 3050 equipped laptops can range as low as $650 if you catch the right sale (this one’s sold out sorry for the tease!). But they don’t get much higher easily under $1000 for most configurations. At four times cheaper they’re certainly not four times less powerful than their 3080 counterparts so weigh your options accordingly.

New mid-tier options coming soon

Coming to laptops in early 2022 from Nvidia are a selection of three mid-tier graphics card options for lightweight configurations capable of some high-end graphical settings like Ray Tracing while keeping power draw weight and heat concerns low.

Information on which brands will come equipped with the new GeForce discrete GPUs hasn’t yet been announced and even some of the specs for the cards aren’t fully known yet but here’s what we do know about these cards.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 2050: A 30-series card in all but name

The confusingly designated RTX 2050 isn’t based on the previous 20-series Turing architecture as might be surmised by the name. RTX 2050 cards actually run on the Ampere architecture just like the 30-series cards which makes the RTX 2050 for laptops more comparable to an RTX 3050 than an RTX 2060. At 2048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 VRAM it matches the RTX 3050 while having a smaller memory width at 64 bits compared to 128. Comparisons to the RTX 2060 are less evenly matched a 2060 has fewer CUDA cores at 1920 but higher memory capacity at 6 GB and a higher boost clock.

The goal of the RTX 2050 appears to be providing a lower power consumption graphics configuration on the latest Ray Tracing platform.

Nvidia GeForce MX570 and MX550: For lightweight performance

Not a lot has been revealed yet on the new MX GeForce laptop cards including no announced laptops that will come equipped with either card. The official announcement says to expect their arrival in Spring 2022 and in the meantime we have some preliminary statements and some speculation to tide us over.

The MX line represents a low-spec but still meaningful upgrade in performance over integrated graphics so the chief comparison that MX-equipped laptops have is against laptops with no dedicated GPUs at all. Although the performance of integrated graphics is in a much better place today than it was not long ago any next-gen gaming still requires a dedicated GPU as do most rendering software applications.

The new MX570 will feature “more power-efficient CUDA Cores and with faster memory speeds than previous MX GPUs” according to the Nvidia announcement. The information on the lower-spec MX 550 isn’t any more detailed stating simply that it will have “more CUDA Cores and faster memory speeds than before”. The most recently released MX GPU the MX450 was released in August 2020 and is of Turing design with 2 GB of GDDR6 memory on a 64 bit memory bus with a base clock of 1.3 GHz and a boost clock of 1.5 GHz. So expect a generational uplift from those modest numbers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3VzdGljcy5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ub3ctZnJlZS1sZy10dnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get NVIDIA GeForce NOW Free for 6 months on select LG 4K UHD TVs,"With the increased popularity of gaming TV makers are competing to include more gaming-friendly features.

TV Tech Tips

“LED TVs” are all LCD TVs that use LED backlighting.

A “Nanocell TV” is an LCD TV with LED backlights and an extra Nanocell layer to improve color. This approach is exclusive to LG.

“QNED mini-LED TVs” add a Quantum Dot layer between a mini LED backlight and NanoCell layers in combination with an LCD panel to display the images.

An OLED TV uses Organic LEDs which are self-emitting (no blacklight required).

NVIDIA GH100 to be a big and power-hungry chip

NVIDIA Hopper shaping to be a monster of a GPU.

According to the latest report from @kopite7kimi NVIDIA’s upcoming HPC accelerator called GH100 is to feature a massive die size of just slightly less than 1000mm² die. What this means is that the GPU might be up to 20% bigger than GA100 based on Ampere architecture.

Just yesterday we reported on a “Hopper” trademark dispute that NVIDIA is facing from a company using a similar name for its products. In case NVIDIA’s ongoing negotiations with the company called ‘Dish Network’ will not end in the next few weeks NVIDIA might not be able to announce its new GH100 GPU at GTC 2022 in March.

DO NOT overreact. We know the actual die size will be significantly smaller than the package size.

But GH100>GA100 is confirmed. 😁 — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) January 29 2022

Furthermore it seems that the rumors about GH100’s Multi-Chip-Module design have been wrong. Now two leakers including @kopite7kimi and @greymon55 both claim that GH100 is in fact a single-die design. However it seems that is indeed a Hopper MCM design. This chip is supposedly called GH102 GPU.

https://twitter.com/greymon55/status/1487259506723594243

The GH100 is also expected to be a very power-hungry chip. Kopite earlier reported that the TDP might even reach 1000W which would require a very efficient cooling system. The company does however already offer a water-cooled data center GPU series called HGX so that technically shouldn’t be a problem."

Street Scene

Well hello and welcome to Street Scene 2022. I trust everyone behaved during my absence. You will recall I said I wouldn’t break my neck on the slopes. But I didn’t say I wouldn’t try. Someone once wrote “all’s well that ends well.” So we will leave it there and let the voice of Tallahassee jump right into the year.

Blinding streetlights

Q. William wants to know if the new purple-blue streetlights are being installed because they are better for the animals health.

A. No these are the same streetlights that Tallahassee city government told us were already purchased and are going up. We were ignored when we questioned the validity of using luminary known as distorted spectrum frequency bright white.

Road rage:LCSO tight-lipped on Tallahassee road rage incident that left Florida SBA employee dead

Crash:Tallahassee teenager dead after Taylor County crash

These lights interfere with our scotopic vision by destroying the rods in the back of the retina a real problem for driving at night since rods allow us to see in low contrast darkness. Some studies show they are not only harmful to humans but all animal life. The streetlights are dying a slow death which is why they are turning color soon they will turn off. Manufacturers claim it is a defect and will replace them.

Using this opportunity to return to the soft sodium vapor streetlights is the humanitarian thing to do. Let’s do what is right.

Runaway speeding

Q. Tom says thank you for Street Scene and would like to add his voice to the problem with speeding drivers. (The No. 1 Street Scene topic). He remembers when speeding in Tallahassee was controlled using speed traps placed on regular and prolonged basis. Tom doesn’t understand why such speed enforcement can’t be used now. Especially on Thomasville Road 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue.

A. There are applications for it but sitting on the side of a road pointing a radar gun or other speed monitoring device has some bad qualities. Foremost is removing the officer from patrol. Also the officer-operator being reliably precise each and every time.

A single vehicle coming over a hill will post a reliable speed on that specific vehicle however multiple vehicles arriving at the same time will require the officer to know which vehicle is speeding. It is tricky.

Keep in mind every traffic citation written is alleging a person committed the act. The court will demand proof the person the officer brought in as a violator is in-fact guilty as charged.

Traffic enforcement efforts are extensive in manpower and expensive in capital. It appears to me city police must assign their limited budgets to take the most serious illegal activity as priority over the lesser. The lesser would be traffic law enforcement.

Street Scene stands united in pleading with Chief Revell: these dangerous drivers are out there please figure a way to issue speeding tickets on a more regular basis.

I’ll make this personal plea to the leader of my Alma Mater The Florida Highway Patrol Colonel Gene Spaulding. Colonel Spaulding we need help delivering a significant message to these dangerous scofflaws.

A handy shortcut to Chick-fil-A

Q. Blacksmith and word nerd Michael would like to take exception with my using the word inept when describing some drivers and their driving habits. Michael says more accurate words would be; “inconsiderate” “reckless “ and or “dangerous.”

A. Listen carefully Michael that thunderous roar you hear throughout Tallahassee is the resounding ""yes!"" from thousands of Street Scene readers cheering you in agreement. Thanks Michael.

Q. Quimby wonders why no one has suggested using the 3/4 mile long driveway that stretches from Capital Circle NE at the O’Reilly Auto Parts store east along the front of Office Depot and then circling back to Chick-fil-A at Capital Circle. It’s plenty long enough to clear the backed up traffic on the (Capital Circle) right of way.

A. Actually your idea has appeared in Street Scene. I’m happy to report I have had several people choosing this driveway approach at the same time as me. The more people using this direction into the restaurant the less slow-moving sometimes stopped vehicles will be coming off Capital Circle. Good timing Quimby thank you for the refresher.

Lane stripes and speed humps

Q. Mike notices different color lane lines — single white line single yellow line and double yellow line. Since you can’t legally cross any of them why are there three types.

A. A single solid white line is restrictive in character and let’s us know we occupy lanes designed for traffic flowing in the same direction. A solid yellow line indicates passing is prohibited but equally important the yellow line let’s us know we are in a bidirectional traffic flow.

The double yellow lines are used to restrict passing in both directions however when the sight restriction opens up in one direction yellow standard skip lines are applied alongside the solid yellow allowing those drivers to pass while keeping the opposing direction from passing until they have a clear unobstructed view ahead.

Q. Chris is annoyed with the speed humps constructed on Live Oak saying police writing tickets or speed cameras is the solution for speed enforcement. Chris wants to know who makes the decision to construct these things?

A. After the initial blitzkrieg of all things “traffic calming” speed humps are now usually in answer to requests by residents along a particular road.

You are correct about increasing the time it takes to get first responders to the emergency. A fully equipped ambulance is heavy and built on heavy duty truck frames. Firetrucks are well trucks. Big ones. Due to the lack of speed enforcement many people believe the only way to increase traffic safety on their residential street is to request the construction of speed humps.

Tensions were high between the two drivers. Media questions to both drivers about the other further intensified that feud. It was NASCAR’s most popular driver versus NASCAR’s most disliked driver.

At Richmond Raceway in 2008 Kyle Busch got loose under Dale Jr while racing for the lead. Dale Earnhardt Jr backed it into the fence and was out of the race as the crowd erupted with anger.

After the race Dale Earnhardt Jr’s crew members walked down to have a talk with Kyle Busch. No punches were thrown but the tensions were higher than they’ve ever been.

As Kyle Busch said “In this moment there was no shits given.”

However Kyle Busch then had to deal with JR Nation. He hired an FBI guy to follow him around the tracks for safety.

The roles reversed soon enough. When NASCAR returned to Richmond Dale Jr found himself next to Kyle Busch once again. This time he turned Busch. The incident appeared to be an accident though years later Dale Jr admitted to Kyle himself that it was retaliation.

The two drivers never sat down to talk about it while they were both on the track. The drivers only recently sat down to talk about it and hash out the memories.

However these’s a new piece to this former feud that the fans missed…

Phoenix: Flipping the bird

“This is Phoenix around 2014 things aren’t going well for me. I’m having a down year. A pretty frustrating year” Dale Earnhardt Jr stated via the Bussin’ With The Boys podcast.

“It’s practice I’m going down the back straight-away and slowing down to come to the pits. I get to the apron Kyle’s behind me and he’s coming by.”

“I guess I was too close to the race track. He didn’t like where I was at it was bothering him and his focus. He didn’t like something about what I did so he flipped me the bird out the window in front of the net.”

“It just sent me over the edge. I’m going to go to my hauler then I see his hauler. I’m like ‘I’m going in there.’ If he’s in there I’m going to confront him about it.”

“I walked up into his hauler. At the very front of the trailer there’s a lounge. In the lounge is Kyle and his crew chief.”

“I said ‘Kyle if you ever flip me off again I’m gonna rip your head off. I’m going to kill you beat the hell out of you.’ I said everything I could just say in that moment.”

Out of character

Earnhardt explained “I never do that. That’s out of character for me.”

“But it was to a point where I needed to tell this guy to knock it off. The words in the media the bird the disrespect has got to come to an end. You’re not going to disrespect me you’re not going to look at me the way you’re looking at me and perceive me the way you’re perceiving me. You’re going to respect me when we’re here together at the race track.”

Kyle Busch didn’t say a word after the words in the hauler.

“I said what I had to say turned around and walked out. I didn’t want him to respond to me and his crew chief didn’t move. It was what I wanted it to be.”

“I didn’t want anything to happen where it would have gotten physical. It probably would have easily gotten that way. It’s good that nothing happened.”

“I was glad to do it I think it changed our relationship. Years later he texted me ‘You own a team I own a team I want to compare some things that y’all are doing.’ Then I had him on my podcast and we talked about Richmond.”

BAÑAGA

BACOLOD City – The unabated increase in fertilizer cost is causing trouble to the sugar industry such as in Negros Occidental at a time when the milling season is already peaking and sugar planting has commenced in many areas.

Former Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) board member Atty. Dino Yulo said prices of fertilizers have more than doubled compared to last year.

Urea the fertilizer grade most heavily used by farmers was selling around P900 per 50-kilo bag about 18 months ago.

“Now we are buying it at P2300 to P2400 per bag” Yulo said.

Planters have been feeling the effects since the last planting season. Several months ago they appealed for national intervention particularly from the Department of Agriculture and Department of Trade and Industry.

“Coupled with that is also the petroleum price hike that has almost doubled as well with diesel fuel breaching the P50 per liter mark” Yulo said.

These price hikes in two major farm inputs will definitely have a “severe impact” in the sugar industry he warned.

With super typhoon “Odette” affecting most of southern Negros that even led to the temporary stoppage of sugar mills planters may not be able to survive if DTI won’t ensure that fertilizers’ cost are kept at bay said Yulo.

Since September there have been appeals for fertilizer subsidies and price caps.

“Our production cost is skyrocketing. With the sugar planting season now commencing we do not know how our producers can survive this especially the farmers in the south” Yulo said.

Last year Negros Occidental governor Eugenio Jose Lacson hoped that national leaders would address the sharp rise in the price of fertilizers.

He suspected that the reason behind the increase was the high cost of fuel.

Confederation of Sugar Producers Association Inc. (Confed) president Raymond Montinola warned of low farmers’ productivity and affect the government’s food security program./PN",,,,,,,,,

""This was a character win today. We had our backs against the wall losing the doubles point and losing four first sets. Our guys didn't stop believing and kept fighting and raising their level. I'm glad we got this experience early in the season"" said ODU Head Coach Dominik Mueller.



In doubles the Broncos took decisions at number two and number three doubles both by 6-2 counts. The number one doubles had the ODU tandem of Younes Lalami and Oliver Nolan leading 5-2 when the point was clinched.



Nolan got the Monarchs on the board with a 6-3 6-4 win at number six singles over Brogan Pierce to start the comeback. Francois Le Tallec put the Monarchs ahead at number two with a 7-5 6-4 win over Anton Arzhankin.



Western Michigan got a point back at number four singles but the Monarchs responded with a pair of three-set comebacks. At number one Luca Maldoner dropped the first set 6-2 but won the last two 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 to bring ODU to a 3-2 lead. Codie van Schalkwyk followed suit at number five dropping the first set 6-3 but winning the last two 6-3 6-4 to clinch the 4-2 ODU win.



Old Dominion (2-2) will now make a two-match swing to New York City next weekend starting at Columbia on February 5.



MUELLER ON VAN SCHALKWYK CLINCHER

Codie stepped up big time to clinch the dual match. He came up with big serves at the end and played to win. Amazing stuff for a freshman in such a pressure situation.



MUELLER ON WIN FOR THE PROGRAM

This is amazing win for our program. Western Michigan finished last year ranked 44th. Being the four seed at the kickoff means you are facing three teams that finished last season ahead of you. To finish the weekend with a win like this gives us tremendous momentum for what's coming up next.

With the win the Monarchs advance to Madison Wisconsin to participate in the ITA Indoor Nationals for the first time in school history. The dates of the event are Feb. 11-13 at the Nielsen Tennis Stadium at the University of Wisconsin.



""Another great day for the Monarchs. That was a wild wild ride this afternoon. I'm so proud of each and every player and coach. Let's keep this going"" said ODU Head Coach Dominic Manilla.



In doubles the Monarchs scored wins at the number two and three spots to take the team point. At number two Marina Alcaide and Shahar Biran defeated Sabina Machalova and Rachel Krzyzak 6-1 for the first win. The tandem of Viktorovich and Alesya Yakubovich clinched the doubles point with a 7-6 (7-5) win at number three. ODU was ahead at number one with Yuliia Starodubtseva and Tatsiana Sasnouskaya up 6-5 when the team point was earned.



Singles matches saw the Monarchs win the battles of two ranked players at the top two spots. Starodubtseva ranked 71st nationally pulled off a three-set win over 20th-ranked Tiphanie Fiquet 2-6 6-1 6-0 to put ODU up 2-1. Sasnouskaya ranked 116th responded with a 6-2 4-6 6-3 win over 80th-ranked Sabina Machalova to push the advantage to 3-1.



The Rebels got wins at number six and three singles respectively to tie the match as Viktorovich was in the third set with Ludmilla Kareisova. Viktorovich ranked 106th nationally rallied after losing the first set to take a 3-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 win to clinch the match.

Asamoah whose status was uncertain due to a sprained ankle suffered Thursday at Towson started and finished with 30 points and seven rebounds. However Dylan Painter who also suffered an ankle injury at Towson was not with the team while receiving treatment in Newark.

BOX SCORE: Delaware 85 JMU 69

Davis the Sanford School graduate who transferred to Delaware from Providence last spring stepped in and made his first career start supplying 22 points seven rebounds and six assists. He was averaging 4.5 points per game.

""Ebby and Jyare were fabulous"" Delaware coach Martin Ingelsby told Blue Hens Radio. ""That's the Jyare Davis that we've seen and I just think his confidence is at an all-time high right now. He just keeps chipping away at it.

""And I can't say enough about Ebby. He's a warrior. I knew he was going to play. I didn't know he'd be able to drop 30 in a game like this.""

Delaware (15-7 overall 6-3 CAA) was playing its last conference game at JMU because of the Dukes’ impending move to the Sun Belt Conference after this school year.

James Madison (12-7 3-5) which won nonconference games over Virginia Old Dominion and George Mason is ineligible for the conference tournament because of its imminent departure. Games against the Dukes still count in the league standings.

HENS TIGERS FLOORED: Game at Towson stopped to due to unsafe conditions

Next for Delaware is the first of four straight home games Thursday against Drexel (9-9 4-4) at 6 p.m. airing nationally on the CBS Sports Network.

Drexel lost 66-62 Saturday at Towson where the issues with the basketball court have been apparently resolved. Delaware led at Towson 38-29 with 18:42 left Thursday when officials stopped the game due to unsafe court conditions after numerous players had slipped and fallen. It will be resumed at a date to be announced.

JMU visits Delaware for a Feb. 14 rematch. Seven of Delaware’s remaining nine full games are at the Carpenter Center. Delaware has won three straight and eight of the last nine over JMU.

CAA EXPANDS: Stony Brook Monmouth Hampton join conference

Jameer Nelson Jr. had 14 points and Andrew Carr contributed a team high eight rebounds and dealt six assists for Delaware.

The Hens shot 49.2 percent from the field (29-for-59) and were 11-for-28 beyond the arc with 21 assists and just nine turnovers. JMU was undermined by 16-for-28 free-throw aim.

CAA STANDINGS: UNCW leads the pack

Delaware never trailed and led by as many as 10 en route to a 43-34 halftime lead. Delaware limited JMU to 35.7-percent first-half shooting and the Dukes also missed seven foul shots.

The Blue Hens’ lead grew to 57-41 with 15:14 left before JMU began chipping away while regaining its shooting touch. The Dukes got within 62-56 with 9:23 left and the Hens only led 71-64 after Charles Falden’s 3-pointer with 5:54 to go.

But a subsequent 10-0 UD run featured Asamoah’s 3-pointer and Davis’ dunk as the Hens pulled away.

The Black and Gold saw four players score double-digit points in the storyline-filled victory Thursday night which also saw senior guard Justin Forrest become the third Mountaineer to reach 2000 career points.

“That has been our strength right now our balance” head coach Dustin Kerns said.

Both teams opened the game slowly by not scoring in the first three minutes. Arkansas State opened the scoring but graduate guard Michael Almonacy quickly responded with a three-pointer and App State never looked back leading for the rest of the game. The game eventually picked up pace with less than six minutes remaining in the half and the Mountaineers went into the break with a 33-27 lead after Forrest drained a three-point shot at the buzzer.

App State opened the second half on a 10-5 run over Arkansas State with the help of senior guard Adrian Delph who scored the first five points of the period. Later the Mountaineers scored on back-to-back dunks followed by a three-pointer by sophomore guard Michael Eads Jr. his only points of the game.

Forrest reached a major milestone in his career scoring his 2000th career point late in the first half with a step-back three-pointer. Finishing with 13 points four rebounds and five assists Forrest played a key role in pushing the Black and Gold to a seven-point victory over the Red Wolves.

On a night with extremely high stakes the crowd and especially the student section created a rowdy atmosphere. The 3000-person crowd could be heard all the way up to the nosebleeds especially late game when the realization of first place was imminent. To begin the game Arkansas State shot three airballs which the crowd responded to with the famous chant “airball airball airball” resonating throughout the arena. The crowd stayed loud for the remainder of the game and was instrumental in the pivotal win.

“It’s everything. Last year we didn’t play with no fans so just having the fans you know was great” Almonacy said.

The student section has been a huge positive for App State this season. Last year involved no home crowds due to the pandemic and in the 2019-20 season App State averaged just 1685 fans per home game compared to an average of over 2300 fans this season. In fact the Mountaineers have only drawn less than 2000 fewer total fans across the 2021-22 season than the entirety of the 2019-20 season despite having played five fewer home games.

“It’s huge to have a home court atmosphere” Kerns said. “There’s no question that impacted the game. There is no question. And so can’t thank them enough and let’s keep it going.”

Overall it was a stellar shooting night for the Black and Gold shooting 38.1% from the three-point line which is 6.6% higher than the season average. One of the main contributors to this high-efficiency attack was Forrest who went 3-6 from three-point range. In addition to Forrest Almonacy went 2-4 and Eads went 1-2 from three-point range. Forrest and Almonacy both finished the game with 13 points while junior forward Donovan Gregory and Delph scored 11 and 10 respectively.

In addition to its impressive three-point percentage App State out-rebounded Arkansas State 39-35 which has been a strong point for the Mountaineers this season.

One of the other major contributing factors to this high-stakes game was the limited amount of free throw attempts that App State allowed. Arkansas State went into the game shooting 14.4 free throws per game and tonight the Red Wolves were held to eight free throw attempts and only shot 50% on those attempts.

App State’s next game is Saturday against Little Rock back at the Holmes Convocation Center. ESPN+ will broadcast the game at 4 p.m."

On January 13th Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) the world’s biggest contract manufacturer said it would spend up to $44bn on new capacity in 2022. That is up from $30bn last year triple the number in 2019 and ahead of earlier plans to spend over $100bn in total over the next three years. Intel an American rival plans to burn through $28bn this year. On January 21st it said it would build two big new factories in Ohio by 2025 at a total cost of $20bn. An option to build six more later would take the overall price tag to $100bn. Samsung of South Korea TSMC ’s closest technological rival has hinted that its capital spending for 2022 will surpass last year’s $33bn. Smaller firms such as Infineon in Europe are also splurging.

IC Insights a research group reckons that across the industry capital spending rose by 34% in 2021 the most since 2017. That torrent of money is welcome news for the industry’s customers who have been struggling with shortages for over a year. For the industry itself it is the latest iteration of a familiar pattern. Bumper revenues like those reported by Intel on January 26th and Samsung the next day compel companies to expand capacity. But because demand can change much more quickly than the two or more years needed to build a chip factory such booms often end in busts. The chip business has swung between over- and undercapacity since it emerged in the 1950s observes Malcolm Penn of Future Horizons a firm of analysts (see chart).

This is particularly true in the case of semiconductors.

Semiconductors are essential elements in electronic devices in a number of sectors including healthcare and medical devices communication computing defense transportation clean energy and key emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The U.S. continues to be a leader with about 50 percent of global market share worth $208 billion in 2020. Semiconductors are one of the top five U.S. exports with more than 80 percent of the U.S. sales to overseas customers. The U.S. industry invests around one-fifth of its revenue into research and development ($44 billion in 2020) ranking as the second highest after the pharmaceutical industry.

According to the Semiconductor Industry Association China has surpassed Taiwan for two years in a row and is only behind Europe and Japan each of which had a market share of 10 percent in 2020.

China which is another emerging player in the semiconductor industry is making fast progress. In 2015 China had a meager share of 3.8 percent of the global chip sales amounting to $13 billion but by 2020 China had improved its score marking an annual growth rate of 30.6 percent capturing a 9 percent market share and about $40 billion in annual sales. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association China has surpassed Taiwan for two years in a row and is only behind Europe and Japan each of which had a market share of 10 percent in 2020. If China were to sustain its current growth rate in the industry its annual revenue could reach $116 billion by 2024 reaching a market share of close to 18 percent putting it behind only the U.S. and South Korea as far as the global market share is concerned.

India has a fairly small presence in the semiconductor arena meant for strategic applications alone. India’s current facilities are the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) Mohali; Gallium Arsenide Enabling Technology Centre (GAETEC) Hyderabad; and Society for Integrated Circuit Technology and Applied Research (SITAR) Bengaluru. But this could change if New Delhi takes the initiative to bring in greater talent and investment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address at the Indian Mobile Congress highlighted Indian ambitions with the prime minister saying that “From 5G technology to artificial intelligence virtual reality cloud internet of things and robotics the world looks towards India with optimism to provide technology enabled solutions that are affordable and sustainable.” The government has begun to appreciate the critical role that semiconductors and displays will play in “the foundation of modern electronics driving the next phase of digital transformation under Industry 4.0.” Semiconductors and display manufacturing are both capital and technology-intensive with long gestation and payback periods and India is looking for both capital support and technological collaborations.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address at the Indian Mobile Congress highlighted Indian ambitions with the prime minister saying that “From 5G technology to artificial intelligence virtual reality cloud internet of things and robotics the world looks towards India with optimism to provide technology enabled solutions that are affordable and sustainable.”

In December last year the Indian government cleared a Program for the Development of Semiconductors and Display Manufacturing Ecosystem in India. This involves an outlay of over $10 billion and the government has declared incentives for every bit of the supply chain including electronic components sub-assemblies and finished goods. A total of $7.5 billion has been sanctioned under PLI (Production Linked Incentive) for large scale electronics manufacturing PLI for IT hardware SPECS (Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors) and the Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme. There is also the PLI for quantum of $13 billion that has been sanctioned for allied sectors that include ACC batteries auto components telecom and networking products solar PV modules and white goods. All in all the government has made a commitment of $30 billion “to position India as global hub for electronics manufacturing with semiconductors as the foundational building block.”

On December 21 while announcing four schemes for the semiconductor industry in India the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) said that the Indian semiconductor market estimated around $15 billion in 2020 is expected to grow to around $63 billion by 2026. The ministry expects that by 2030 India’s semiconductor market will be driven by wireless communications consumer electronics and automotive electronics with 24 percent 23 percent and 20 percent of the market share respectively. In recognition of the growing demand the ministry added that India has to “develop secure and resilient semiconductor supply chains for industrial growth digital sovereignty and technological leadership.” They also announced that they expected to start receiving applications from January 1 2022 from industry players for setting up semiconductor fabs (fabrication plants) and display units. In an effort “to drive the long-term strategies for developing a sustainable semiconductors and display ecosystem a specialized and independent ‘India Semiconductor Mission (ISM)’” is being created. This mission is supposed to be run by global experts in semiconductor and display industry and “will act as the nodal agency for efficient and smooth implementation of the schemes on Semiconductors and Display ecosystem.”

The Tata Group is reported to be in talks with a number of international semiconductor companies including the Taiwanese TSMC and UMC for chip manufacturing in India.

Meanwhile in another significant move the government is reported to be in talks with Taiwan to set up a semiconductor manufacturing facility in India. The Indian government has already selected several sites for this purpose. If the talks succeed one of Taiwan’s major semiconductor producers – the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or the United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) – could be executing it.

There is also domestic interest in the semiconductor industry. In December the Vedanta Group publicized its plans to invest $15 billion on display and semiconductor manufacturing in India across five to 10 years. The Tata Group is reported to be in talks with a number of international semiconductor companies including the Taiwanese TSMC and UMC for chip manufacturing in India. The Tata Group reportedly wants to develop an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) facility with an investment of $300 million. They have identified Tamil Nadu Karnataka and Telangana as possible sites for the facility. Reportedly the plant will “assemble and test semiconductor chips after sourcing the sophisticated silicon wafers from semiconductor foundries like Taiwan-based TSMC Fitch Solutions.” The government appears to be excited about the Tata proposal.

Others are also entering the Indian market. The U.S. chip-maker Intel has also expressed interest in setting up a semiconductor manufacturing plant in India which the Indian MeitY minister immediately welcomed.

Clearly India appears to be making a major push to increase its presence in the semiconductor manufacturing sector. Whether these many initiatives that the government is sponsoring will overcome the traditional obstacles of bureaucracy red tape and a capricious tax regulatory regime remains to be seen.

PYPL,PayPal,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9wYXlwYWwtc3RhYmxlY29pbi13aGF0LWl0LWNvdWxkLW1lYW4tZm9yLXBheW1lbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal stablecoin: What it could mean for payments,"PayPal confirmed on Jan. 8 it is “exploring a stablecoin” that could be called PayPal Coin after a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin within the source code of the company’s iPhone app.

PayPal senior vice president of crypto and digital currencies Jose Fernandez da Ponte said at the time that if the company plans to move forward with the stablecoin it will do so while working closely with relevant regulators — an approach that could help the fintech firm avoid the wrath of United States senators that doomed Meta’s Diem cryptocurrency project.

The company has clarified that the source code found on its iPhone app was developed in an internal hackathon. When Cointelegraph contacted PayPal to learn more a spokesperson confirmed the previous reporting but did not offer any additional commentary.

The potential impact of a PayPal stablecoin in payments overall and in the cryptocurrency industry is hard to estimate and while some experts see the firm’s move as an extremely positive one for the space others believe the stablecoin would be more of the same.

Could PayPal Coin normalize crypto payments?

It’s clear that a traditional finance company moving into the cryptocurrency sector and launching its own stablecoin differs from a crypto-native firm launching a stablecoin. Traditional finance companies serve users who aren’t necessarily already dealing with cryptocurrency wallets or the volatility in this space.

PayPal itself has well over 350 million active users and already lets users in the U.S. and United Kingdom buy sell and hold Bitcoin (BTC) Ether (ETH) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) while enabling payments in these crypto assets. While it’s unclear how many of PayPal’s users have paid with cryptocurrency it’s well-known that stablecoins are mostly a tool used to trade and take advantage of opportunities in the decentralized finance space.

PayPal further pushing into the cryptocurrency industry through the launch of a stablecoin could see other traditional banking and payments companies explore blockchain technology more according to Marwan Forzley CEO of online payments platform Veem. Forzley told Cointelegraph that stablecoins will “likely become a part of the global payment scheme” as moving money in a secure environment with on- and off-ramps with different applications “is a major need of small businesses.” Forzley added:

“PayPal Coin could fuel general interest in payments overall. Consumers and small businesses alike are looking for a safe and reliable alternative to traditional currencies and payment networks.”

Max Galka CEO of blockchain search engine Elementus seemed to agree with Forzley’s assessment noting that with globally recognized platforms such as PayPal supporting cryptocurrencies stablecoins are immediately put in a “trusted realm for a large swath of the population.”

To Galka PayPal launching its own stablecoin would “definitely open up cryptocurrency to more people” who “have not had the inclination to really figure out this niche space.” Galka told Cointelegraph:

“Right now there aren’t that many well-established trusted organizations in this space where trust is such a critical component. PayPal would be one of the first major financial companies to embrace crypto.”

He said it’s a “very natural fit for PayPal to develop a stablecoin” as the move puts the firm “squarely on the map as a cryptocurrency company” which could boost its other cryptocurrency offerings while the trust people have in the firm could see PayPal Coin “serve a lot of additional purposes from what traditional stablecoins can offer by using that [trust] as their payment rails.”

Arbel Arif founder and CEO of crypto marketplace Shopping.io told Cointelegraph he applauds PayPal’s move into the crypto sectors and added that having “big players enhancing the e-commerce crypto transactions brings us a step closer to the new era of commercial trading.”

Speaking to Cointelegraph Tim Frost founder and CEO of wealth management platform Yield App said that cryptocurrency payments are “finding their way into the mainstream” as a “number of companies now allow digital asset owners to pay with digital currencies using standard Visa or Mastercard.”

To Frost whether or not PayPal launching its own stablecoin would jumpstart a transition to a more cryptocurrency payment-focused world isn’t clear although he does believe it has the potential to do so.

Not everyone agreed that PayPal Coin could be revolutionary however. Speaking to Cointelegraph Rytis Bieliauskas chief technology officer of cryptocurrency payment gateway CoinGate said he does not see how a PayPal stablecoin is “fundamentally different from what PayPal already does” assuming it’s “centrally controlled” and has its value guaranteed by the firm.

Bieliauskas added that it’s “interesting to see that PayPal wishes to use crypto as a positive PR move” which to him suggests the public now sees cryptocurrencies as something positive rather than negative.

Overcoming regulatory challenges

While PayPal made it clear it would be working with relevant regulators on its stablecoin if and when it moves forward with the project it will still have to overcome regulatory challenges because of the scope of its business.

That’s according to Eli Taranto chief business development officer at EQIBank — a licensed digital bank working with corporations and high-net-worth individuals. Taranto told Cointelegraph that PayPal’s geographical footprint will see it face “worldwide regulatory issues” when it comes to crypto which will “be quite interesting and a necessary challenge.”

To Taranto PayPal’s revenue coming from transactions means it will “have to connect as many tokens and chains as possible building faster better fully automated cross-chain instruments along the way.” He added:

“This may eventually serve as a catalyst for mass adaptation of crypto and give the crypto processing industry a boost as venture capital will begin to flow to this relatively new sector.”

Taranto said that if PayPal manages to appease regulators it will affect other institutions which will “see it as a sign that a path to global regulatory compliance has been created.”

Stablecoin issuers have notably not only faced scrutiny from regulators as the cryptocurrency community often pressures them to be as transparent as possible about the backing of their stablecoins. Launching a stablecoin will see PayPal deal with heightened scrutiny so it’s worth asking What’s in it for them?

How PayPal benefits from a stablecoin

Ultimately PayPal issuing its own stablecoin is an improvement to its bottom line. Caleb Silver editor-in-chief at financial information portal Investopedia pointed out that in the third quarter of 2021 transaction-related expenses cost PayPal $2.7 billion according to its most recent quarterly filing.

The use of a high transaction throughput blockchain like Solana could see PayPal save a very significant amount in transaction-related expenses. The firm currently does not allow users to buy or sell Solana (SOL) on its platform and on which blockchain it would deploy its stablecoin is unclear.

Speaking to Cointelegraph Jerald David president of digital asset investment firm Arca said PayPal is “uniquely positioned to adopt cryptocurrencies due to their captive client audience and because this potential product offering is an enhancement to their existing core business.” David added:

“By marrying the efficiencies of blockchain technology with their existing business model they can help instill and solidify the confidence of individuals and small businesses in the digital asset industry.”

To Arca’s president it’s likely that if people are going to end up adopting digital assets one day they’ll be doing so through a third party that has earned their trust just like PayPal.

What’s known about PayPal’s stablecoin plans is very little. Steve Moser the developer who found PayPal Coin’s code on the company’s iPhone app revealed later on that PayPal had references to stablecoins linked to the pound and euro within the application suggesting PayPal would launch various stablecoins linked to different fiat currencies.

What if PayPal Coin is something separate from Paypal’s USD stable coin? What if PayPal was also working on stable coins for the Pound and the Euro? #PayPalCoin $PYPL $PYPLUSD https://t.co/vyBmMCmp7f pic.twitter.com/qRJ0IrbBBJ — Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) January 10 2022

Shortly after PayPal Coin started making headlines however PayPal removed images for its euro- and pound-linked stablecoins. A reference to Neo within the code stayed suggesting it may also be on the firm’s radar.

The real impact a PayPal Coin may have will depend on the company’s implementation of the stablecoin. While it has the potential to ingrain crypto into traditional payment systems it also has the potential to be “just another” stablecoin. The best-case scenario is seemingly one crypto enthusiasts dreamed about years ago before Bitcoin traded in five-figure territory which shows just how far we’ve come in only a few years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybWFpbC5uZXdzL2lzc3Vlcy8yMDIyLTEtMjkvbXItc3RhcmNyYWZ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Jimmy Soni on PayPal ""The Founders"" and Elon Musks's Love of Video Games","Of the memories that one early PayPal employee recalled from his time at the start-up in the late 1990s and early 2000s among the most vivid was the nod from the boss.

The boss was Elon Musk then C.E.O. and co-founder of the company. The nod was a signal for the employee to pause what he was doing and compete against Musk on the office’s arcade version of the video game Street Fighter. “He would come over and give me the little you know head nod toward the break room” the employee recalled chuckling.

Musk wasn’t just the leader of the company—he was reportedly the firm’s top Street Fighter contestant. The employee on the receiving end of “the nod” admitted that his own skills at the game didn’t surpass Musk’s but that he could give his C.E.O. a run for his money from time to time. “Most of our games came down to the third fight” the employee remembered “as he would win one and I’d win one. And that third tie-breaker fight usually came down to a few pixels on the health meter!”

As the world comes to learn more about its now wealthiest entrepreneur a great deal has been written about Musk’s contemporary goings-on—his leadership of Tesla SpaceX and the Boring Company among other subjects. But in researching The Founders: The Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley my new book on the origin story of PayPal I found that many people who knew Musk early on in his career remarked on something that the press doesn’t often talk about: his kid-in-a-candy-store passion for all things video games.

A program listing for Blastar a video game Musk designed as a child.

Young Musk was no casual weekend gamer. His earliest commercial success came in 1984 when at the age of 12 he wrote and sold the code for a game called Blastar for $500 to the magazine PC and Office Technology. “In this game you have to destroy an alien space freighter” the listing noted “which is carrying deadly Hydrogen Bombs and Status Beam Machines. This game makes good use of sprites and animation and in this sense makes the listing worth reading.”​​

“E.R. Musk” published the game’s dozens of lines of code for the Commodore Vic 20 platform a Spectravideo home computer whose eight-bit model had debuted the year prior. Musk and his younger brother Kimbal planned to open a video-game arcade close to their school but their need for a city permit ultimately reportedly put a pin in the plan.

“He would just come over and give me a little head nod” the employee recalled. “And that was the sign for me to go over to Street Fighter.”

During college at the University of Pennsylvania Musk took these and other talents and joined the buzzy Palo Alto–based video-game start-up Rocket Science Games as an intern. Founded in 1993 Rocket Science Games featured a roster of remarkable graphic designers and talented engineers. The job was unglamorous—“He was the ‘disc flipper’ that came in at night while the game software was rendering” his supervisor Mark Greenough told me—but the work gave Musk a taste of Silicon Valley as well as burnished his video-game bona fides. (Two Rocket Science titles—Loadstar: The Legend of Tully Bodine and Cadillacs and Dinosaurs: The Second Cataclysm—feature Musk’s name in the game credits alongside those of his Rocket Science colleagues in the “Ground Control” division of the company.)

As Musk launched his own ventures in Silicon Valley his interest in video games endeared him to his engineering colleagues. One engineer Ed Ho who worked at an early Musk venture the software start-up Zip2 recalled that he and others felt a kinship with Musk in part because of their boss’s ability to stay up all night playing video games. Among their favorite games was StarCraft ​​a military-science-fiction real-time strategy game. “He’s Mr. StarCraft” said Ho of Musk.

A great deal about Musk—his competitiveness his technical savvy and the respect he commands from his engineers—is reflected in his years as a video-game engineer and enthusiast. These days his gamer background has even entered his professional foreground on occasion. Among other Easter eggs that have delighted Tesla owners over the years: the inclusion of video games in the digital console that serves as the car’s nerve center—a gaming nod from the boss that now reaches millions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvbmV3cy9wYXlwYWwtdGFrZXMtc3RlcHMtdG8tcHJldmVudC1vbmxpbmUtcHJvYmxlbS1nYW1ibGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal Takes Steps to Prevent Online Problem Gambling with Software Blocking,"PayPal Takes Steps to Prevent Online Problem Gambling with Software Blocking

PayPal is taking steps to make sure its payment processing platform isn’t used to fuel problem gamblers’ online casino habits.

PayPal the world’s largest facilitator of online financial transactions recently integrated software that can prevent the movement of money related to internet gambling. PayPal has partnered with Gamban a third-party software product that comes with an array of features that blocks access to thousands of casino and gambling websites.

Gamban is a downloadable app for iOS and Android that essentially acts as a firewall that prevents the user from accessing gaming networks.

Gamban explains that its product can now be installed into any PayPal account free of charge. Gamban says users wishing to do so should contact PayPal to initiate the gaming-blocking software.

Gamban prevents access to any site that offers games of chance/skill casino games sports betting horse and greyhound wagering lottery tickets person-to-person betting and gambling-related ventures such as handicapping services.

For people seeking to fully prevent their smartphone or other mobile devices from being used to gamble — not just their PayPal account — Gamban’s full functionality is accessed by paying $3.49 a month or $2.92 per month for yearly subscriptions.

PayPal iGaming

In 2003 long before any US state had legalized iGaming PayPal announced that it would stop serving as a payment intermediary for online casinos and their customers.

Delaware legalized iGaming in 2012 and New Jersey followed in 2013. PayPal reversed its ban on iGaming transactions as a result but only for internet gaming sites regulated by a state gaming authority.

Today legal iGaming is widespread in the US. Along with Delaware and New Jersey online slot machines and table games are lawful in Pennsylvania West Virginia Michigan and Connecticut. Regulated mobile sports betting is operational in 20 states plus DC. Nevada permits online poker but no other gambling.

Gamban advises PayPal customers seeking to prevent a relapse in their problem gaming recovery to take advantage of multiple safeguards. Along with Gamban to block PayPal from fueling their chaotic gambling the company suggests individuals self-exclude themselves from iGaming sites.

In the UK problem gamblers and addicts can ban themselves from iGaming sites by registering with GAMSTOP. Those who register with the nonprofit are banned from all internet gaming platforms and apps that are licensed in Great Britain.

US iGaming Resources

For problem gamblers in the US several leading iGaming firms have also implemented Gamban software.

FanDuel and Unibet both received praise from the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) last year for their commitment to curbing excessive betting. The two online sportsbook and iGaming operators are offering Gamban to their US customers free of charge.

The NCPG has affiliate problem gambling councils in all but 15 states. But every state that has some form of legal commercial gambling offers resources and treatment programs for those seeking help.

This weekend’s read is a white paper issued recently by the Federal Reserve Bank pondering whether the Fed should create its own digital currency similar to Bitcoin.

The Federal Reserve plays several critical roles in the country’s financial system. It issues paper and coin currency backed by the country’s assets. It also serves as a “bank for banks”: Commercial banks keep accounts with the Fed and use them to enable large transfers between each other using the Fed’s central clearinghouse mechanism; the Fed also loans money to those commercial banks. It controls the country’s monetary policies most notably the interest rates it charges to commercial banks in order to influence economic growth employment and inflation. Finally the Fed regulates and monitors commercial banks to ensure that the country’s banking system is safe and reliable.

The rise of digital currencies is an interesting new twist on the role of a central bank such as the Federal Reserve. Digital currencies aren’t that new; in a rudimentary form they have existed in online forms for many years for example in online gaming environments where players can earn and/or buy points that can then be spent traded or given away. And apps such as Paypal and Venmo essentially maintain their own digital currency as well from the point that money enters their system from the outside world until it leaves again.

Currencies whether cold hard cash or in digital form are all a form of “shared fantasy” in that they only carry value to the extent that we all agree that they do and agree on what that value is. International currency exchange rates represent the constant revaluing of a particular country’s currency based upon its economic and geopolitical prospects. But for a digital currency such as Bitcoin it becomes much more difficult to get agreement and the wild fluctuations in Bitcoin prices serve to highlight that there is hardly consensus. Just this past week former first lady Melania Trump tried to auction off a hat using digital currency but found that the winning bid deflated significantly in value overnight as the value of the currency crashed. Attempts to manage volatility has led to the creation of “stablecoins” digital currencies whose value is tied to a specific real-world currency but generally require assets to be held in reserve to support that value.

Nevertheless digital currencies have many attractions. They can dramatically reduce the cost and overhead of a financial transaction (as we see in apps such as Paypal) and especially for small “micropayments.” They could potentially be more inclusive opening up a wider range of online transactions to the estimated 7 million households in the United States that are unbanked as well as the hundreds of millions of unbanked households around the world. Digital currencies could make cross-border payments easier and they could provide a higher level of privacy.

On the other hand many of those attractions could also be liabilities. Digital currencies may subvert governments’ efforts to police illicit financial transactions from organized crime and terrorist groups. They make it more difficult for central banks such as the Fed to regulate the financial system and they make tax evasion easier. And the underlying cryptographic technology behind Bitcoin and other “cryptocurrencies” use a tremendous amount of electricity that largely goes unaccounted for as a cost of the system and also has significant climate impacts.

The Fed in its white paper asks whether it should launch its own digital currency in an attempt to maximize the benefits while minimizing the liabilities. A Fedcoin if you will could provide stability by being pegged to the dollar and could even be managed as part of the central bank’s overall currency and backed with federal assets. One assumes that every commercial bank would have an account with the Fed that carried a Fedcoin balance and could be used for inter-bank transactions. The Fed would need to decide whether it wanted to go with a Paypal-style model where it also maintained accounts for any U.S. resident and company or a Bitcoin-style approach using blockchain technology that is more akin to cash where transactions are decentralized.

The Fed’s white paper asks a few other challenging questions such as whether its digital currency could work “offline” allowing for transactions in places and times where there is no available connection to the Internet — the way cash currency does now. It also pokes at the privacy questions: If the Fed is mediating financial transactions in its currency does that give the federal government even more ability to track every aspect of our lives? Moreover does it give the IRS access to our financial transaction history and any balance we might maintain directly with the Federal Reserve?

The white paper answers none of these questions nor does it set out to do so. It’s positioned more as a thought exercise and it emphasizes that the Fed wouldn’t move forward to create its own digital currency “without clear support from the executive branch and from Congress ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law.” But it does point out that the rise of both payment apps and digital currencies present both opportunities and challenges for our country’s central bank and almost certainly for every other nation’s central bank as well.

According to a press release obtained by EBONY Sanders inked a multi-year partnership agreement where he will work with the brand ""to drive national exposure of HBCU programs and athletes.”

Sanders joins a list of star-studded athletes who have partnerships with Gatorade including Serena Williams Candace Parker Zion Williamson DK Metcalf and Jayson Tatum to name a few.

“It’s an honor to join the Gatorade family and represent this historic moment for HBCU athletes” Sanders said. “I can’t wait to work with Gatorade on and off the field to help create even more opportunities for HBCU students and athletes.”

Chauncey Hamlett CMO/VP of PepsiCo Beverages North America South Division expressed his excitement about Sanders joining the Gatorodade team and reaffirmed the company's vision of partnering with HBCUs.

“As one of the country’s best freshmen college football players Shedeur Sanders is another incredible addition to the Gatorade Family” Hamlett said. “In his first year at Jackson State University he’s already demonstrated the excellence and tenacity Gatorade athletes are known for and we’re excited to partner with him and build upon our commitment of supporting HBCUs and their athletes.”

At 19-years-old Sanders was the first HBCU athlete to win the Jerry Rice Award and was also named the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) Freshman of the Year after leading Jackson State University to its first division title in eight seasons and the conference championship.

The signing of Sanders is the latest example of PepsiCo’s commitment in collaborating with HBCUs. The brand has an exclusive partnership with JSU's Football Coach and Shedeur’s father Deion Sanders an EBONY 2021 Power 100 honoree. The company recently released its first HBCU commercial spotlighting JSU and Florida A&M University marching bands; it has multi-year partnerships with the National Battle of The Bands; and it is the primary beverage sponsor of the Southwestern Athletic Conference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvaGFyZC1tdG4tZGV3LWJhamEtYmxhc3TSAT5odHRwczovL3d3dy50cmVuZGh1bnRlci5jb20vYW1wL3RyZW5kcy9oYXJkLW10bi1kZXctYmFqYS1ibGFzdA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fan-Favorite Hard Soda Flavors,"HARD MTN DEW Baja Blast Offers a Familiar Flavor with a 5% ABV

The HARD MTN DEW Baja Blast is being launched as the latest flavor of the alcoholic soda line that is targeted towards avid fans of the soda flavor to enjoy when seeking out a libation. The drink features the recognizable flavor of MTW DEW Baja Blast but with a 5% ABV to make it suited for adult consumers only to pick up. Featuring a zero-sugar recipe the drink will come in tall cans and will be right at home within the existing lineup of hard drinks created in partnership between PepsiCo and the Boston Beer Company.



PepsiCo Beverages North America CEO Kirk Tanner commented on the new HARD MTN DEW Baja Blast saying ""For 80 years MTN DEW has challenged the status quo bringing bold flavors and unmatched beverage innovation to millions of fans. The Boston Beer Company partnership combines two recognized leaders in our respective industries to address the changing tastes of drinkers and we are thrilled at the opportunity to create HARD MTN DEW that maintains the bold citrus flavor fans know and expect.""

Trend Themes 1. Alcoholic Soda - There's a trend towards creating more alcoholic soda flavors that appeal to fans of popular non-alcoholic beverages. 2. Low-sugar Beverages - With health-conscious consumers seeking out lower-calorie drink options the trend towards low-sugar alcoholic beverages is likely to grow. 3. Collaborative Partnerships - Like PepsiCo and the Boston Beer Company companies in related industries can benefit from teaming up to create new or improved products to meet changing consumer tastes. Industry Implications 1. Alcoholic Beverages - The alcoholic beverage industry could benefit by tapping into the popularity of well-known non-alcoholic drinks and creating more hard soda flavors. 2. Non-alcoholic Beverages - Soft drink companies and manufacturers could create partnerships with alcoholic beverage companies to create new flavors based on popular non-alcoholic drinks. 3. Food and Beverage Collaborations - Collaborative partnerships between players in the food and beverage industry like PepsiCo and the Boston Beer Company offer the chance to innovate and create new products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRydW0uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMS8zMC9xdWFrZXJzLXBsYW5zLW1vdGl2YXRlLW1pbGxlbm5pYWxzLXN3aXRjaC1vYXRzLWluZGlh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quaker's plans to motivate millennials to switch to oats in India,"Reaffirming its health-led positioning PepsiCo-owned Quaker the leading oats brand has launched a refreshed brand identity for the Indian market. This marks the first-ever brand refresh since its launch in 2006.

Oat consumption has been a mixed bag in the Indian context with its unique breakfast habits and palette. Taste as well as the positioning of the category have been the primary challenges.

Over the last few years oat consumption has seen a spike on the back of the increased awareness around health especially among younger consumers.

Quaker has been around for more than 15 years in India and the other brands in the category include Saffola Kellogg’s Baggry’s among others.

Quaker is set to launch the new global brand look and on the cards is a change in the brand’s packaging design along with the adoption of the new global logo.

To make the packaging future-ready and increase its appeal to digital-savvy consumers the new-look pack will come with a QR code. The QR code will give easy access to Quaker’s Content Hub – a platform with a variety of recipes – on YouTube.

Continuing with the nutrition-led proposition for millennials and announcing the new brand identity Quaker has launched the brand campaign conceptualized by Wunderman Thompson India.

The campaign narrative is to help the new-age consumers incorporate oats more actively in their daily diet.

The campaign depicts how one needs the ‘fuel’ to keep going in the modern-day fast-paced life and how it helps to maintain weight and reduce cholesterol.

Elaborating on the brand film Bauddhayan 'Buddy' Mukherji director Little Lamb Films said “You have heard ‘life is a race’ a thousand times but the 'how' is what this film brings alive. We recreated an entire day one's daily lap on an actual racetrack. Building on the moments like the daily rush office meetings an evening with friends etc. on an actual 400m track to give a first-hand experience of how the right fuel enables you to win your day.”

In India Quaker oats are also available in variants such as multigrain and with flavour mixes.

Talking about the new brand identity launch Sonam B Vij associate director and category head Quaker PepsiCo India said “The revamped brand image gives the brand another opportunity to connect with the ‘real fit’ and those who are passionate to win in life.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmNpcmNsZS5pbi9lbmdhZ2UvZ2V0LWluc3BpcmVkL2FjaGlldmVycy9tb3N0LXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWwtYnVzaW5lc3Mtd29tYW4taW5kaWEtMjAxMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most Successful Business Women In India 2022: Top Female Entrepreneurs,"Most Successful Business Women In India (2022): Top Female Entrepreneurs

In this Motley Fool Live video recorded on Jan. 19 Fool contributors Keith Speights and Brian Orelli discuss whether or not the prospects of a fourth dose are dwindling.

10 stocks we like better than Pfizer

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10 2022

Keith Speights: I mentioned that there were results from a study conducted in Israel and they were announced this week. This study found that a fourth dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine did not prevent infections from the coronavirus omicron variant. Both of these stocks fell on the news on Tuesday. Are the prospects of a fourth dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dwindling you think?

Brian Orelli: Yeah. The study tested this fourth dose of the vaccine and it did bring the antibody levels back up. But researchers said that that wouldn't actually protect patients from the omicron variant. I think a fourth dose of the original vaccine certainly seems less likely than before.

But Pfizer and BioNTech as well as Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) and others are developing omicron-specific boosters. I think there's still hope for the vaccine makers that they can have at least one more round of boosters if the new variant specific boosters actually work which we don't know yet. But assuming they actually work and I think it's likely that would be the case. I think vaccine makers aren't dead in the water quite yet.

Speights: Brian Moderna stock also fell although not as much as BioNTech. Do you think investors were just assuming that there would be similar results with the fourth dose of the Moderna vaccine?

Orelli: Yeah. They actually tested Moderna after Pfizer in this study as well. I think that the results are likely to be the same. I think they really need an omicron-specific booster at this point.

Speights: My mom texted me last night asking how long do the third boosters last? My response was no one knows yet. Have you seen any data at all so far that indicates how long the third booster's efficacy is likely to extend?

Orelli: Yeah. I don't think we have enough people who've been out from a third dose long enough to have a good idea. It becomes really difficult because the way who do you compare it to?

If you're looking at the people who have gotten a third dose are you comparing it to the people who got two doses? Or I guess that's makes the most sense. But then finding an equal group that you think is equally as likely to get infected becomes sort of difficult.

You can certainly look at antibody levels and that's after the third dose and look and see if they are watching them decline. You can do that. But actually looking at whether the third dose provides protection from either infection or from severe disease I think is a little more difficult to measure over time.

Speights: You made a good point Brian. Any testing of fourth doses of the current vaccines might really be a moot point because Pfizer and BioNTech expect to have their omicron-specific vaccine version ready by March I think.

The EU ombudsman Emily O'Reilly issued a formal recommendation telling von der Leyen's office to search for and hand over the texts under a freedom of information request lodged by a journalist.

In April last year the New York Times revealed that EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla had exchanged text messages and calls about vaccine procurements for EU countries.

The European Commission chief used 'personal diplomacy' to secure the deal for 1.8billion Pfizer vaccines via texts with the CEO the paper revealed.

Journalist Alexander Fanta of news site netzpolitik.org then asked the Commission for access to the text messages and other documents but the executive branch did not provide them.

An official EU watchdog has slammed Ursula von der Leyen for keeping secret text messages with Pfizer's CEO

The commission rebuffed the freedom-of-information request refusing to say whether the texts existed - even though von der Leyen had referred to them herself in a media interview.

According to the ombudsman's inquiry the Commission did not clearly ask von der Leyen's cabinet to look for the text messages.

Instead the Commission said the only information they had was an email a letter and a press release.

'This falls short of reasonable expectations of transparency and administrative standards in the Commission' O'Reilly said.

'When it comes to the right of public access to EU documents it is the content of the document that matters and not the device or form. If text messages concern EU policies and decisions they should be treated as EU documents.

The ombudsman said the commission should ask von der Leyen's office to again look for the texts and if it found them 'the Commission should assess whether public access can be granted to them' in line with EU rules.

'The EU administration needs to update its document recording practices to reflect this reality.'

Von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla (pictured) had exchanged text messages and calls about vaccine procurements for EU countries

The Commission argued a 'text message or another type of instant messaging is by its nature a short-lived document which does not contain in principle important information concerning matters relating to policies activities and decisions of the Commission' and that 'the Commission record-keeping policy would in principle exclude instant messaging.'

They also told the ombudsman that 'to date it has not recorded any text messages in its document management system'.

But O'Reilly rejected this argument saying that texts fall within the Commission's definition of a document.

Von der Leyen's Commission spearheaded the pre-purchase of Covid vaccines for the 27 EU countries.

More than half the doses the commission has bought or optioned are sourced from BioNTech-Pfizer making it by far the biggest supplier to the bloc's inoculation efforts.

The commission refuses to divulge key aspects of its contracts with Covid vaccine suppliers notably on pricing citing commercial confidentiality.

Last year there was a mad scramble to secure vaccines with the EU and the UK coming to blows over contracts with the major pharmaceutical companies.

While Britain was able to get on top of their world-beating vaccine rollout and administer 20 million jabs within a few weeks of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines being approved EU leaders lagged behind in implementing a vaccine plan.

Brussels chiefs were furious at AstraZeneca for promising the UK first deliveries of its vaccine supplies claiming it has reneged on its deal with the bloc.

Countries such as France and Germany then went back-and-forth about whether to rollout the AstraZeneca jab which sowed doubts among the public and led to a low uptake of the vaccines.

Von der Leyen's active public role in ensuring vaccine access included one-on-one conversations with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla a dual Greek-American.

Her commission rebuffed a freedom-of-information request last year for the text messages refusing to say whether the texts existed -- even though von der Leyen had referred to them herself in a media interview.

It argued to the ombudsman's service that it was only obligated to hand over archived documents and that text messages or other forms of instant messages did not qualify being ""short-lived"" and unlikely to ""contain in principle important information"" on its policies activities or decisions.

The ombudsman strongly disagreed saying in her recommendation ""it is clear that text messages fall within the scope of the EU’s law on public access to documents"" and that EU case-law upholds the duty by EU institutions to retain documentation related to its activities.

""The case concerns whether if the messages concern the commission’s work and if it holds them the commission should have granted public access to them. How the commission dealt with this matter did not allow those questions to be answered. The ombudsman considers that this constituted maladministration"" it said.

The ombudsman said the commission should ask von der Leyen's office to again look for the texts and if it found them ""the Commission should assess whether public access can be granted to them"" in line with EU rules."

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhcnRhbnN3aXJlLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9saXN0cy9saXN0LW9mLXNjaG9vbHMtbXN1LXRyYW5zZmVyLXBnLWFqLWhvZ2dhcmQtaXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1jb25zaWRlcmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,List of schools MSU transfer PG AJ Hoggard is reportedly considering,"Former Michigan State point guard AJ Hoggard has reportedly cut the lists of schools he’s considering to only five programs.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Supervised by South Korea’s Industrial Policy Research Institute the Korea Brand Hall of Fame is an annual award event that selects the brands most loved by consumers.

Launched in 2017 Lil has been well received by the consumers who bought more than 1 million units in the first year.

After this initial success KT&G released line extensions such as Lil Plus Lil Mini Lil Hybrid and Lil Solid. By 2021 the cumulative sales of Lil exceeded 4 million units in Korea alone.

Lil performed well internationally too. In January 2020 KT&G signed a supply contract with Philip Morris International for overseas marketing and sales of Lil which subsequently secured a bridgehead for expansion in the global cigarette market.

KT&G started selling Lil in Russia Ukraine and Japan in 2020 followed by product launches in Central Asia and Europe. In November 2021 KT&G launched Lil in Guatemala. Today KT&G exports Lil to 23 counties.

“We built the brand Lil on the identity of ‘practical minimalism’ together with systematic technological innovation” said Lim Wang-seop head of KT&G’s next-generation product business unit in a statement. “We’ll make the brand recognized by the world consumers through developing the products that meet their needs and tastes.”",,,,,,

There have been several iterations of Shorties since Chris Barnhill opened it as a food truck in 2012. It has operated exclusively as a food truck and as a traditional restaurant located at 116 SW Frank Phillips Blvd. — now the home of Boomerang Diner.

Most recently Shorties has operated at 319 ½ S. Dewey Ave. an alley location where Barnhill cooks inside the food truck handing finished orders through a window to customers sitting in the physical restaurant. Shorties is also known locally for its extensive catering and food truck appearances at local events.

The Research Center however is open to staff and not the public. Early in the pandemic when service was slow for many restaurants Shorties was among several food trucks occasionally hired to go to the Research Center. Barnhill was already looking for a change so when he was approached by Phillips to take the food service provider contract he accepted.

“I’m the main cook and I can’t be in both places. (The permanent location) is becoming more work than what I really want. Doing a food truck year-round takes a special person … It’s a really cool idea I don’t want to leave the space. We’ve tried to talk ourselves out of doing it but it’s so cold” Barnhill said.

While there is a heater in the food truck having to pass food through a window brings in a lot of cold and when there is snow it is just too cold to stay open Barnhill said.

At the Research Center Shorties will operate inside a building eliminating that problem. They will serve breakfast and lunch instead of just lunch as the restaurant has previously and the restaurant will also cater events at the Research Center. Barnhill said he will take his current staff who will move to full- from part-time work and be able to hire three or four more people.

“I haven’t even been out there (in a while) but I’m getting emails saying they’re glad I’m coming out and look forward to me being out there. I think the response is good as far as the Research Center” Barnhill said.

Since the start of the pandemic Shorties has struggled like many other restaurants.

When in-person dining was closed statewide the restaurant took on work as a “ghost kitchen” handling DoorDash orders for five to six other restaurants. A popular one included Mr. Beast Burger — a virtual restaurant brand started by YouTuber Mr. Beast.

The company advised Barnhill on ingredients and how orders should be made and passed on information on local orders placed through its website and DoorDash. Barnhill fulfilled the orders from Shorties for a cut of the profits.

“It was kind of like a franchise … We did a lot of that that helped us through the year. We pivoted a lot tried figuring out what was and wasn’t working and I think we just pivoted ourselves into a corner” Barnhill said.

Shorties will begin food service at the Research Center on Monday.

The food truck will still cater and serve food at some public events and Barnhill said he plans set up the truck around town on weekends a couple times a month.

He will update social media as those plans arise so customers will know when they can order their favorite burger or taco.

“There’s going to be a lot of people who can’t come out there it’s not open to the public. I’ll miss seeing a lot my customers but I don’t see a lot of customers anymore now because I’m in the truck” Barnhill said.

“I think everybody understands it’s a good opportunity for me for the most part. The folks who come in are … sad to see us go. We’re sad to go as well but I just think it’s going to be a better opportunity for all of us.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Surge in lateral well length is driving average well productivity to new heights in the Permian.

The average productivity of new wells in the Permian Basin is set to hit a record high in 2022 breaching past 1000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) due to a surge in lateral well length Rystad Energy research indicates.

New wells are expected to break the 1000 boepd threshold in 2022 for the first time on record rising from the 974 boepd achieved in 2021. Average daily production levels have steadily climbed since 2010 closely aligned with the horizontal well length which is expected to reach 9500 feet in 2022.

The total completed lateral footage of wells in the Permian is expected to reach a record high of 50 million feet in 2022 beating 2021’s total of 45.8 million feet and racing past pre-Covid-19 levels of 47.5 million feet seen in 2019. In 2020 total lateral footage in the basin dropped due to the pandemic and reduced activity clocking in at only 32.5 million feet in 2020.

Operators only started using ultra-long wells of up to three miles in length in the Permian in 2014 but their popularity has quickly grown. Their market share has rocketed in recent years representing only 4% of completions in 2017 versus 18% in 2021. However considering total completed lateral footage in 2021 these wells accounted for as much as 23% of completions.

The average horizontal well length in the Permian increased to 9300 feet in 2021 up from 9000 in 2020 bucking the overall trend of average US shale well lengths which stayed relatively stagnant. This increase signals a growing trend among operators to favor longer wells with an eye on increased productivity.

“The Permian is now entering a three-mile lateral era. Such long wells were viewed as inferior for their high finding and development costs in some deeper zones just a few years ago but modern equipment and completion methods allow extended reach wells to spread across the entire basin” says Artem Abramov head of shale research at Rystad Energy.

The perforated length of the horizontal section of a well has always been viewed as a critical driver of well productivity and costs. When unconventional development began horizontal well lengths were short with most under 5500 feet the equivalent of about a mile. As technology and mechanical capabilities have advanced well lengths have increased helping new wells be more productive. Well productivity is measured over the first 180 days after a well starts producing oil due to the front-loaded nature of unconventional oil production.

Lateral footage of individual wells has expanded as operators increase efficiency and boost production. Ultra-long wells – typically between 2.5-3 miles long – were widely tested in nearly all US basins between 2016-2018 but these lengths becoming the norm in the industry seemed unlikely.

However it may be too early to view the increase in ultra-long laterals as an industrywide trend in the Permian. Some key operators contribute to this segment with a disproportionally large weightage relative to their total number of completions. For example the largest Permian operator Pioneer Natural Resources accounted for 12.6% of the basin’s horizontal completions in 2020-2021 – including wells originally completed by DoublePoint Energy Parsley Energy and Jagged Peak Energy. Yet Pioneer accounted for as much as 18.6% of completions with a perforated length greater than 12500’.

Greg was the middle child between sister Paula brother Steven and younger siblings Doug and Sandra. His siblings recognized his ""bossy"" management skills at an early age. He honed those skills in his professional career. His internal drive is evident in his children Sean Jenna Erik and Grayson where he raised them lovingly hands on all the while coaching them as they matured. Many words could be used to describe him: genuine friend; problem solver; non solicitor of advice; jack of all trades- if he didn't know the answer...he found it; resourceful; self taught; born leader; motivator; orchestrator of people; entrepreneur; inspiration to all and would never let a good deal pass him by. Greg was intense reliable and a connoisseur of good food good wine and good times! He discovered a love for cooking while working at Tangier's Anthe's Garner's Blondies Bill Crocker's and Guy's Restaurant & Party Centre during his teens and 20s. His passion for baking evolved while he was the head chef at Guy's Restaurant and Party Center. The opportunity to purchase Ideal Bakery presented itself at 25 yrs of age and he plunged into the bread baking industry with a determined force where he successfully managed and expanded the business. In 2007 Greg met the love of his life Lisa (Lyons) and together they set upon their life journey. Following the romantic proposal in Napa Valley they married in 2009. Their life in Jackson Township is immersed in the community. Their family life involves golfing skiing and sports and has been incredibly blessed and full of love.

The mining pool community has also completed its decentralization and Governance Mining is open for applications on SUN.io's website to welcome more projects to the SUN Governance Mining.

Created by SUN.io after it acquired JustSwap for an overall rebranding SunSwap is the largest DEX on the TRON network. It then became TRON's leapfrog innovation in the DeFi space by integrating the advantages of both JustSwap and SUN.io featuring TRON-based on-chain token swap liquidity mining stablecoin swap and staking and platform governance.

The up and running Governance Mining on SUN.io is well received by users with a TVL of over $600 million to date. As TRON's first platform that incorporates stablecoin swap stake-to-mine feature and self-governance SUN.io always hopes to scale up cooperation with premium projects while improving the platform. This is why Governance Mining is now open for applications on the SUN.io website to invite community projects to the SUN.io ecosystem.

SunSwap V2.0 upgrade

Putting its mind to long-term value creation and better user experience SunSwap makes sustained efforts to upgrade its products based on users' needs. With features like one-click liquidity migration and improved user interfaces for the exchange fund pool and explorer modules SunSwap V2.0 delivers a friendlier user experience. Users can also add liquidity to trading pairs of any two TRC20 tokens on SunSwap V2.0 which frees them from redundant swaps and enables them to trade the most popular tokens right away.

Upon the launch of SunSwap V2.0 its TVL has surged past $1.7 billion with a staggering 34.1% APY offered by the NFT-TRX liquidity pool. By upgrading both its user experience and functionality SunSwap is gaining incredible traction among users which marks not only another milestone for SUN.io and the TRON blockchain but is also epoch-making for DeFi and the wider blockchain industry.

SunSwap completes integration with SUN.io

Liquidity mining on SunSwap will end on January 28 2022 at 20:59:59 (SGT) in parallel to which the reward distribution rules will be adjusted. Once concluded SunSwap liquidity mining will no longer generate rewards. Previous rewards will be distributed according to the revised regulations and users can still claim their rewards in SunSwap > Liquidity Pool as they used to. At the same time the new pools will go live on SUN.io marking the full integration of the two.

Story continues

Upgraded two-token mining delivers decentralized community governance

The new pools launched on SUN.io will support two-token mining for selected LP tokens in SunSwap V1 and V2 enabling miners to earn dual rewards of SUN tokens and project tokens via Governance Mining. The new token SUN functions as the multi-purpose governance token for the platform (similar to CRV for Curve DAO and EPS for Ellipsis). It grants SUN holders various rights and benefits including the right to vote community governance value capture staking rewards etc. in a bid to deliver truly decentralized community governance.

By staking LP tokens to participate in the new pools users can earn mining rewards in addition to transaction fees.

How to mine on the SUN platform?

Users need to hold LP tokens to take part in liquidity mining and mining pools only accept their respective LP tokens. For example USDT-TRX LP mining pool only accepts USDT-TRX LP tokens.

LP token holders may visit the Liquidity Mining page on the SUN.io website find the mining pool they want to participate in enter the number of tokens they want to stake and then wait to harvest their mining rewards when the staking begins.

Two-token mining rewards-the SUN token

In pools that support two-token mining one of the reward tokens is SUN which is given by the SUN platform to participants of Governance Mining. The amount of SUN rewards will be determined by the voting weights of the liquidity mining pools which will be updated at 8:00 every Thursday (SGT). Users can lock SUN for veSUN and thus boost their SUN mining speed by up to 2.5x; they can also vote in liquidity pools with veSUN to decide how SUN rewards are allocated in different pools.

Two-token mining rewards-the project token

Unlike SUN rewards rewards distributed in the project token are not affected by the voting weights of the liquidity mining pools and the mining speed cannot be boosted by locking SUN. In pools that support two-token mining rewards are distributed in the project token in addition to SUN: WTRX the project token in the ""stablecoin - TRX"" liquidity pools is provided by TRON DAO to incentivize users to co-build the TRON ecosystem. For other liquidity pools the project token rewards are provided by project teams to boost users' engagement in providing liquidity and staking LP tokens. Project teams reserve the right to update the rules of distributing project tokens including how many tokens will be distributed each week if any. Please pay attention to the latest announcement on the websites of SUN.io and project teams.

Participate in SUN Governance Mining

At present the project teams' pools supported in Governance Mining are SunSwap V2 liquidity pools. Once approved eligible pools can be added to the list of liquidity pools in Governance Mining and users can stake corresponding LP tokens for SUN rewards.

What is Governance Mining?

Governance Mining is a stake-to-mine project launched by SUN.io for community self-governance. It now supports LP tokens in stablecoin liquidity pools and SunSwap liquidity pools.

To participate in 3pool and USDC liquidity mining users need to make deposits in the corresponding pool on SUN.io provide liquidity to earn LP tokens and then stake these tokens for mining. To participate in SunSwap liquidity mining users must first add liquidity on s unswap.com to get LP tokens before staking these tokens on SUN.io for mining.

Governance Mining Phase II is now open. Users can choose a liquidity pool on the website to stake LP tokens in and boost the mining speed of the chosen pool with veSUN. They can claim SUN tokens earned from staking directly to their wallets. Also users can vote with veSUN to decide the weight of a liquidity pool: the proportion of veSUN votes determines how much SUN will be allocated to a pool as rewards.

The SunSwap-SUN.io integration and new mining pools have diversified the use cases of SUN giving play to community self-governance further adding utility to the SUN token and facilitating the growth of the SUN ecosystem. As an integral part of DeFi and a key component of the TRON ecosystem SUN will keep powering the entire DeFi space providing its users with a solid platform that embraces complete autonomy across the board.

SUN.io is set to become a decentralized autonomous community with long-term vitality and we will keep paying back to our community users with rewarding mining projects. Users are welcome to try out the brand-new mining pools on SUN.io and our door is always open to high-quality project teams. We'll continue to keep coming up with more exciting plans so please stay tuned.

About SunSwap

The upgraded SunSwap will incorporate TRON on-chain token swap liquidity mining stablecoin swap staking and self-governance benefiting the TRON DeFi ecosystem by giving total effort to the DEX system. Furthermore as a native utility token on SunSwap SUN will be used to govern the platform reward liquidity providers and buy back tokens with revenue on the platform manifesting TRON's original aspiration to extend benefits to the broader public.

Cunard is Britain's high-end cruise line and is known for luxury and its links to royalty. The Queen Mother Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth II all visited Cunard ships over the years and the Queen Elizabeth ship was even named after the royal herself.

The cruise line mostly caters to older guests. A Cunard spokesperson told Insider that the average age of its guests is 61.

On Carnival Cruises the theme is fun. Carnival's ships are nicknamed the ""fun ships"" and the brand is seen as more of a budget-friendly option in the cruising industry according to Cruise Critic. The ship's audience is a bit younger and the average age of passengers is 45 according to Cruise Compete.

Residents in a Summerland resort community are suing for thousands in damages.

Four residents of condos in the Summerland Waterfront Resort on Lakeshore Drive have filed a civil suit against the Resort Rental Resort Pool Association along with multiple members of the strata board after being sued themselves for not paying the expenses the resort claimed they owed.

There has been a long-standing feud between the strata corporation and some owners of units at the hotel over including their places in the rental pool.

While the owners argued that the covenants on their property do not require them to have the unit in the rental pool or state limits on occupying the unit the bylaw for the resort hotel as a tourism building contradicted this.

Residents spoke to Castanet in February of 2021 when the zoning issue came before Summerland council.

Summerland Waterfront Resort strata president Leisa Shea responded to Castanet via email at that time claiming that the hotel unit owners using their units exclusively are in violation of the zoning and the strata council is following protocols to bring all owners into compliance.

The District of Summerland denied the rezoning request that would have allowed resident owners on the property to stay full-time rather than add their unit to the rental pool.

But the residents and resort continued to push against each other entering into legal action with the Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) which many of the owners tried using to help mitigate the conflict.

From there the Resort Section of the owners the Strata Plan the Summerland Resort Rental Pool Association and the Summerland Resort Inc. sued six residents: Michael Drance William and Sarah Berry Kristin Poitras and Edwin and Loreen Knelson on Aug. 30 2021.

The resort alleged that the hotel was incurring operating expenses while providing four star amenities to all occupants without the proper fees.

“The defendants have chosen to occupy their hotel strata lot exclusively. As base expenses were disproportionately assumed by the owner in the rental pool expenses borne by all owners were identified” their claim reads. “These attributable expenses were divided amongst all owners.”

The resort went on to claim that the defendant has not been bearing the costs with the structure of the rental pool and has been advised of the increased monthly expense allocation that started on Jan. 1 2021.

“The defendants refused to pay the attributable expenses as billed monthly.”

The resort filed notices against the owners each amounting to $35236.00.

All cases were dismissed by a judge for lack of jurisdiction in provincial court in December.

On Jan 25 2022 four of the owners who were originally sued by the resort came back with their own matching civil suits demanding damages for the alleged behaviour of the resort seeking $35236.00.

The residents claimed that the association represented the interest of the owners in the rental pool and all are participants in the “intentional negligence harassment civil conspiracy to commit emotional abuse fraud and violations of their own Hotel Management Agreement.”

Increases in fees over the past 14 years grew from $600 to $1400 per year according to their claim until 2021.

“In 2021 the defendant unreasonably and fraudulently decided I should now pay many times that amount. These expenses are all items incurred during the day to day operation of the hotel to earn revenue. Receiving no income from the hotel these expenses are not a benefit to me"" reads one of the matching claims.

In the claim they emphasize that they feel the hotel had tried to force them into the rental pool the past two years and is charging fees that are ""completely fraudulent.""

“They have turned the other owners against me and I no longer feel comfortable living there. They refuse to discuss the issue and I am forced to sue them” reads the claim from one unit's owner Michael Drance.

Each of the residents are suing for severe and negative effects on their health impact on marriages and personal relationships along with impact on well-being and quality of life.

Michael Drance bought his unit in August 2019 and said that it is unfortunate the issues have gone from claims in the CRT and into provincial court.

He received a decision from the CRT that the strata council for the building cannot force owners into the rental pool.

“We've been forced to sue them too for basically turning our lives into a nightmare for the last two years” he said.

""The four of us some of them who have lived there for 14 years are the ones who get shafted here.”

""They've been increasing fees with inflation from what started about $600 a year recently up to $1400 a year. And all of a sudden now they say that I owe them $12000 a year.""

What is the structure of the bad bank?

NARCL will acquire and aggregate the identified NPA accounts from banks while IDRCL under an exclusive arrangement will handle the debt resolution process State Bank of India Chairman Dinesh Khara said on Friday in a press conference.

Padmakumar Nair a Chief General Manager from SBI’s Stressed Assets vertical will manage NARCL while Manish Makharia Head of Alternate Investment Fund SBI Funds Management Pvt Ltd will head IDRCL.

Subrata Biswas the nominee director on the Board of NARCL will be the interim Chairman and Diwakar Gupta will continue as the Chairman of IDRCL.

Khara said that although “certain concerns” were raised eventually both NARCL and IDRCL have received the requisite approval. The concerns mainly arose on the dual ownership structure and operational mechanism with the setting up of two separate entities NARCL and IDRCL.

“This is a structure which has been envisaged for the first time and whatever time has been taken it is essentially to iron out some of the issues which could have possibly come up in future. So they have all been ironed out and they have been appropriately addressed. And so that the functioning of both entities should be smooth and they should be in a position to achieve the objective for which they’re brought into existence” he said.

Majority-owned by state-owned banks the NARCL will be assisted by the India Debt Resolution Company Ltd (IDRCL) in turn majority-owned by private banks in resolution process in the form of a Principal-Agent basis.

How will the bad bank work? What does the Principal-Agent mechanism entail?

NARCL and IDRCL will have an exclusive arrangement that will be as per the scope defined in the ‘Debt Management Agreement’ to be executed between these two entities. This arrangement will be on a ‘Principal-Agent’ basis and final approvals and ownership for the resolution shall lie with NARCL as the Principal Khara said.

While he argued that this is as per the structure “originally envisaged” the Indian Banks Association (IBA) is learnt to have wanted a dual structure with the asset management company or AMC as a privately held entity to be out of the purview of the regulatory entities.

In Premium Now | Explained: What is reverse repo normalisation?

That would have given it requisite flexibility to deal with the resolution process as normally a single entity is accountable as owner and for recovery of the assets in the asset reconstruction business. But now with the ‘Principal and Agent mechanism’ that has been put in place to address regulatory concerns the final approvals will still be done by NARCL as the Principal.

So even though IDRCL is majority-owned by private banks the final authority will rest with NARCL which is majority-owned by public sector banks. This has been done possibly to address regulatory concerns around the bad bank structure.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had in her February 1 2021 Budget speech proposed a new structure for the resolution of stressed assets.

“The high level of provisioning by public sector banks of their stressed assets calls for measures to clean up the bank books. An Asset Reconstruction Company and Asset Management Company would be set up to consolidate and take over the existing stressed debt and then manage and dispose of the assets to Alternate Investment Funds and other potential investors for eventual value realisation” she had said.

What kind of resolutions are expected?

The asset resolution will be done in a phased manner. A total of 38 accounts aggregating Rs 82845 crore have been identified for transfer to NARCL.

In the first phase at least 15 accounts worth Rs 50335 crore will be transferred to the proposed bad bank by March 31. Initially an estimated Rs 2 lakh crore worth of bad assets was planned to be transferred; however some of these accounts have already been resolved and further resolutions will happen as and when referred to the bad bank.

With a combination of post-Covid moratorium and recoveries there was an actual decline in NPAs from Rs 8.40 lakh crore in 2020 to Rs 7.80 lakh crore in 2021.

What will the government guarantee?

The NARCL will purchase these bad loans through a 15:85 structure where it will pay 15 per cent of the sale consideration in cash and issue security receipts (SRs) for the remaining 85 per cent. The SRs will be guaranteed by the government. The government guarantee will essentially cover the gap between the face value of the security receipts and realised value of the assets when eventually sold to the prospective buyers.

The government approved a 5-year guarantee of up to Rs 30600 crore for security receipts to be issued by NARCL as non-cash consideration on the transfer of NPAs. This will address banks/RBI concerns about incremental provisioning.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

HAMMERTOWN Calif. – The gates have opened on the annual Progressive King of the Hammers Powered by OPTIMA Batteries.

What started as a beer bet amongst a dozen friends in 2007 is now one of the biggest off-road events on the planet and one of the largest events held on public lands in the United States. For those who can’t make the trek to Hammertown fans can join the extended community of more than three million people by following the live coverage online and participating in live chats all week long.

Tens of thousands of fans and more than 500 teams gather on Means Dry Lake in the Southern California desert each year for eight days of intense racing and festivities on and around the punishing rock trails known as The Hammers. The names are unforgettable including Sledgehammer Wrecking Ball Full of Hate and Hell To Pay. Even more unforgettable are the struggles and triumphs these teams experience in the attempt to tackle the infamous trails and reach the finish line.

Offering over a week’s worth of competition the humble beginning of King of the Hammers was just one race through the desert and rocks of Johnson Valley. Now the races include off-road’s biggest names in desert trucks UTVs stock vehicles and the unlimited Ultra4 cars (4400). Kicking off the week is the Toyo Desert Challenge Presented by Monster Energy featuring desert race trucks. The grand finale of King of the Hammers week is the Nitto Race of Kings on Saturday Feb. 5 – the race that started it all. For years the 4400 unlimited race was referred to as King of the Hammers but as this event has grown to encompass more than just that one race it deserved its own title.

The Nitto Race of Kings pits the top pre-qualified drivers in unlimited vehicles against each other on the same combination of desert terrain and rockcrawling trails several of the other races earlier in the week but then ups the ante with a third lap comprised of even more difficult terrain. Many try but few succeed with a finish rate of less than 50 percent being common in the past. Many of the vehicles are custom built by the drivers themselves who are just as talented as fabricators engineers and welders as they are as drivers and co-drivers. Platforms include single seat and two seat front engine and rear engine solid axles and independent suspension all vying against each other for victory.

Hammertown is the makeshift city built to support the races and fans – complete with street names more than 150 vendors race pits Jumbotrons for live viewing from the course and live music at night. King of the Hammers has become a destination for gearheads from around the globe with many spectators bringing their own UTVs and rockcrawling buggies to Johnson Valley to actively recreate between races.

While there have been a few different actors who have voiced the gecko over the years—the very first commercial featured Kelsey Grammer in the role—for many years the character has been voiced by English actor Jake Wood. And though Wood might be known best for voicing the GEICO gecko in the U.S. he's popular for an entirely different reason in the U.K. Read on to learn more about Wood's career outside of the famous reptile.

He almost stopped working with GEICO a few years ago.

There was a mild insurance company mascot scandal in 2015 when as reported by Digital Spy Wood tweeted that after 10 years he would no longer be the GEICO gecko because he claimed he ""refused a huge pay cut."" Not long after he tweeted ""Hey Twitter regarding a dispute I had with a lizard this week. I apologise. I was upset. Moving on nothing more to see x.""

Wood then retained his job with GEICO and continues to be credited for their commercials online. He has also tweeted about his work with the company following the dispute. In 2017 he wrote that he had been ""the voice for the Geico Gecko for the last 11 years."" In 2020 he wrote in response to a tweet by actor Bryce Dallas Howard about her movie Jurassic World: Dominion ""Go Bryce. With love from the GEICO GECKO x (me friend of your driver Richard!).""

The PM is under pressure from some Conservative MPs to scrap or at least delay the national insurance increase to win back support as he awaits the findings of Whitehall and police inquiries into claims of lockdown-busting parties held in Downing Street.

But Johnson with the chancellor has now made a firm commitment to go ahead with the 1.25 percentage point increase designed to tackle the Covid-induced NHS backlog and reform social care.

Writing in the Sunday Times the pair insisted that it is right to follow through on the “progressive” policy. “We must clear the Covid backlogs with our plan for health and social care – and now is the time to stick to that plan. We must go ahead with the health and care levy. It is the right plan” they said.

“It is progressive in the sense that the burden falls most on those who can most afford it. Every single penny of that £39bn will go on these crucial objectives – including 9m more checks scans and operations and 50000 more nurses as well as boosting social care.”

Johnson and Sunak said they are both “tax-cutting Conservatives” but there is “no magic money tree”. “We believe passionately that people are the best judges of how to spend their own money” they said.

“We want to get through this Covid-driven phase and get on with our agenda of taking advantage of our new post-Brexit freedoms to turn the UK into the enterprise centre of Europe and the world. “We want lighter better simpler regulation especially in those new technologies in which the UK excels. We are also Thatcherites in the sense that we believe in sound money. There is no magic money tree.”

In April national insurance is due to rise by 1.25 percentage points for workers and employers. From 2023 it is due to drop back to its current rate with a 1.25% health and social care levy then applied to raise funds for improvements to care services.

Political opposition to the change has come from all sides of the Commons as MPs fear the impact that cost of living pressures could have on stretched household budgets.

The stock market is getting pummeled this year. Growth-focused stocks have gotten hit particularly hard as investors rotate out of that sector. While this sell-off has been brutal to stomach it's also providing some compelling opportunities for long-term investors.

The sell-off hit the tech sector the hardest which has captured investors' attention. That's causing many investors to overlook some under-the-radar growth stocks that have also tumbled during the correction. Two that stand out as more compelling opportunities right now are NextEra Energy (NEE 1.58%) and Prologis (PLD -1.15%).

A growth stock hiding in a slow-growth sector

Utility stocks tend to be the domain of income investors like retirees because they typically don't grow that fast. However NextEra Energy isn't your average utility. Over the last decade it has grown three times faster than other large utilities powered by its focus on the fast-growing state of Florida and the renewable energy megatrend.

These catalysts have created enormous value for long-term investors. Over the last decade NextEra has generated a more than 700% total return doubling the return of the S&P 500.

However despite its success shares of NextEra Energy have sold off this year tumbling more than 20% from its recent high. That's due somewhat to the recent announcement that it is handing the company over to a new generation of leadership which spooked investors. Because they focused on the leadership change they missed its accelerating growth rate.

NextEra recently reported its fourth-quarter results capping off an excellent year where it grew its adjusted earnings per share by 10.4%. Meanwhile the accelerating growth in renewable energy development boosted its earnings growth outlook for 2022 and 2023. It also extended its forecast out two more years. The utility now expects to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2022 with 6% to 8% annual earnings from that higher base through 2025.

That outlook is conservative. The company said it would be disappointed if it didn't deliver growth at or near the high-end of its range. Meanwhile there's upside potential to that long-term forecast if it makes acquisitions or the U.S. passes more legislation to spur additional renewable energy development.

With NextEra's stock down 20% it's trading at a much more attractive valuation given its accelerating long-term growth prospects.

Insatiable demand for this real estate

Growth-minded investors also often overlook real estate investment trusts (REITs) because they typically sacrifice growth for income. However that's not the case with leading industrial REIT Prologis. Demand for logistics properties is red hot these days enabling the REIT to grow rapidly.

Prologis has grown its cash flow per share at a double-digit compound annual rate over the last five years including 14% last year. Meanwhile it sees nearly unstoppable growth ahead as demand for industrial real estate grows. The sector is benefiting from the rapid shift toward e-commerce and a change in inventory management practices due to global supply chain issues.

These demand drivers are pushing up rental rates. Prologis captured 18% higher rental rates as existing leases expired last year. That provides lots of embedded growth because of the long-term nature of its leases. Prologis' existing portfolio has a $1.2 billion net operating income (NOI) growth opportunity at the current market rate for rents. That's meaningful for a company that produced $3.4 billion in NOI last year.

With demand continuing to grow Prologis estimates rents could surge another 10% this year providing even more embedded long-term growth upside potential for its legacy portfolio. On top of that the company can develop more logistics properties to further benefit from fast-rising demand. It has enough land to build $26 billion of new industrial properties giving it years of growth potential.

Despite this growth potential shares of Prologis have declined by 10% already this year. That had it trading at a much more attractive value given the growth still ahead.

Great ways to add new growth drivers to your portfolio

While technology stocks often offer some of the best growth potential it's not the only sector with growth stocks. NextEra Energy plugged into the renewable energy megatrend helping power accelerated growth. Meanwhile Prologis is benefiting from the accelerating adoption of e-commerce and the supply chain issues plaguing other companies to drive outsize growth. With their shares tumbling amid the market sell-off these under-the-radar growth stocks look like even more attractive long-term buys right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,

After serving in the United States Coast Guard Tom had a successful career in financial services where he established trusted advisor relationships with clients across firms Kanawha Valley Bank Prudential Financial and Merrill Lynch. His greatest life achievement occurred in 1964 when he met and fell in love with Antoinette (Toni) Thomas and together they raised four children on Loudon Heights Road in Charleston WV.

Tom enjoyed nothing more than spending time with his family and was proud of their participation in the Charleston community. His nephews nieces and friends of his children were over at the house and in the neighborhood often and they all developed an appreciation for Tom’s kind caring and nurturing personality. Anybody who knew Tom knew that safety was always top mind for him. His children and their friends still recall that the final advice he would shout as they left the house was always ""THINK!"" It was so obvious that Tom had a gift of ensuring those around him knew that he genuinely cared about their well-being. Whether passing along an article writing a thoughtful note or never missing an opportunity to ask about a detail others might overlook Tom was able to express his love so naturally. So many of us were lucky to experience his influence.

In 2003 Tom and Toni bought a lot of land and built their dream house in Wilmington NC where they have spent the last 20 years enjoying family and friends in Landfall and the greater Wilmington community. They envisioned a life where they could walk on the beach together every day and attend the various school and social events of their grandchildren in Wilmington and Concord NC. That’s exactly what they did! We can’t tell you how many times people around town would tell us “We saw your Mom and Dad walking on the North End of Wrightsville Beach today!"" They loved to walk from the Surf Club where they have many friends and meals to Mason’s Inlet and back. And they always did it together valuing the lifelong friendship and interest in one another. Tom not only loved Toni but was in love with Toni and that was so evident. They gave us all something to aspire to and made our day!

Beyond the beach they could be found together at their grandchildren’s events where Tom loved being on the sidelines of the soccer fields cross country and track meets basketball baseball and lacrosse games tennis matches the golf course school events graduations Senior night grandparents’ days surf and wake boarding viewings – the list goes on! Tom loved participating in the some would say immature jokes and musings of his grandchildren. Nothing would make him laugh like a casual reference to a bodily function made by a grandchild! Tom also looked forward to meeting friends for meals and restaurants at Landfall and The Surf Club and homes around town and valued hearing the stories about life and career experiences of his contemporaries. He was very good at keeping up with his long time friends for his entire life especially on the phone. Always close to his heart were his G.R.A.S.S. buddies.

As a brother Tom had a deep admiration and appreciation for Bill and Bob. He valued his relationships with his brothers and what it meant to be a brother. The fondness and respect in his voice was obvious when speaking about Bill’s medical career and role with Coastal AHEC and Bob’s business career and achievements with Anheuser-Busch. More important was the pride he had in their lifelong relationships with their spouses their children and grandchildren. Tom was so grateful to have been one of three brothers and never took this dynamic for granted. It’s taught us all what it means to be a true brother whether by blood or friendship.

We cannot honor Tom without talking about his experience as a volunteer. He was a longtime member of the Rotary Club of Downtown Wilmington NC past President and member of the Rotary Club of Charleston WV and served on the board and as the President of the Holowell Foundation in Lewisburg WV. Tom could often be found on the sidewalks helping the Salvation Army and many other charitable events organized by Rotary. He was also a U.S. Coast Guard Hospital Corpsman First Class. He donated his time and energy to many events as a member of the New Hanover Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) – which was right up his alley! If you knew Tom you knew that his first concern in any situation was the safety of all those around him. He wasn’t alive if he wasn’t worried that’s just the way it was. Nobody was more prepared for the famous ‘Y2K’ nonevent. Tom procured a 500-gallon drum for water and enough provisions and emergency kits for his extended family to survive Armageddon for many years. Some would say that was a waste of his time. Tom would tell you his family was safe no matter what and that’s all that mattered! There are countless other examples and that’s why we loved him.

Finally although Tom loved the beach he never lost his love for West Virginia. An avid sports fan of both the Mountaineers of WVU and the Thundering Herd of Marshall University Tom had an interesting way of cheering for his teams. He would talk them up read and research the players and the staff banter with anybody who would listen about those Mountaineers. But when it came time for kickoff or tip-off Tom was nowhere to be found. Whether it was superstition or that the games made him so nervous that he couldn’t bear to watch Tom didn’t watch! He would get the updates from others and then start preparing for the next game! After moving to Wilmington Tom also adopted the UNCW Seahawks and loved attending basketball and soccer games on campus – for some reason he could bear to watch those maybe the love/hate relationship wasn’t as deeply rooted?!

We loved him dearly and will miss him desperately. It brings us all peace and a big smile to know that Tom is now having a drink and a cigar with those that have passed before him. Worry no more rest and relax as you deserve. Your legacy will be carried on with honor grace much love and humor!

The family has asked that in lieu of flowers a memorial gift honoring Tom can be made to either the United Service Organization (USO) or St. Therese Catholic Church.

The nor’easter snowstorm has delivered heavy snowfall and high winds as predicted in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said at a news conference on Saturday.

More than 100000 power outages have been reported statewide and more are expected overnight due to high winds he said.

The snow was falling at a rate of 2 to 4 inches per hour for several hours in many parts of the state and is expected to continue for the next couple of hours Baker said. Southeastern Massachusetts may receive up to 30 inches of snow while the greater Boston area may get 2 feet the governor said.

The rate of snow is expected to slow soon but light to moderate snowfall will continue until approximately 11 p.m. ET.

Utility crews are doing damage assessments and will begin working on restoring power when wind falls below 35 mph Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs Katie Theoharides said during the presser.

Baker said crews will be working throughout the night into early tomorrow morning to clear the snow. Approximately 3000 pieces of snow-clearing equipment are in use across the state he said. The governor said it will take until at least mid-morning Sunday for the roads to be in better condition for drivers.

The Massachusetts governor said the tractor-trailer ban on all interstate highways will remain in effect until 11:59 p.m. Saturday.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike Hammerspace it is not building a metadata-based control plane for a global collection of files that is in the data path – yet it does know about all the files in such a collection because it indexes them. So what is the difference between its Global Data Index and Hammerspace’s Global Data Environment?

This was explored in an IT Press Tour briefing in Silicon Valley. Let’s take it as read that organisations are facing a steadily rising torrent of file and object data what is called unstructured data and that keeping it all on filers is not a good idea. They are designed to provide fast read and write access to the files they store and becoming more flash-based than disk drive-based. That’s good for speed but bad for cost. Keeping 100 to 200TB of data on an all-flash filer is affordable whereas keeping petabytes is generally not.

We need a way to identify files that are not being used much but need to be retained and move them to cheaper storage. We can ask the customer to do this identification but the task rapidly becomes impossible. It’s doable with 100 files 200 files 300 files but is becoming a growing burden with 1000 2000 … 5000 files and effectively impossible as we move past 10000 files to 100000 files and on to a million files and then in more and more organisations 10 and 100 million files and even beyond that.

The task has to be automated. The only way to do that is to know what files exist in the first place and where they are. Once we know that we can apply policies to them – such as “move all files which have not been accessed for six months to object storage in the public cloud.”

This is the first thing Komprise’s software sets out to do when it is deployed. It discovers the filers and object stores in an organisation’s IT infrastructure both on-premises and in the cloud and indexes their contents – assimilates them in a sense – and builds a global index in the AWS public cloud. It finds and copies all the metadata for an organisation’s files and objects across all its disparate and heterogeneous systems and indexes the files and objects using said metadata: item name address owner creation date type size last access date and so forth.

One Komprise customer has an index of over one hundred billion files. There is no way such a vast population of files could be managed manually.

Once that index exists then customers can set policies to define which files should be moved to lower cost storage. This is a very flexible activity. There is no need to have a hard and fast hot/cold data boundary. We start by saying all data on filers unless otherwise specified is hot. Then a policy can be set to say all customer orders for example in transaction systems must be move to Azure Blob or S3 object storage if they are more than three months old and haven’t been accessed for eight weeks.

Another policy can say that accounting records for a quarter can be moved to long-term and cheaper storage six months after they were last accessed. Yet another might say that all files of type .jpg in the marketing department should migrated to the Google Cloud platform once they are 16 weeks old. The policy setting is infinitely flexible. If there is a metadata item attached to files then it can be used singly or in combination with other items to filter files create a subset and move files in the subset to colder storage and that files in Europe must be moved to cold storage in Europe to comply with data sovereignty rules. Workflows can be set up to do this.

Two things come to mind here. One is that the global index must be kept up to date so that as files in the filers age are accessed or not and get deleted these facts are known and the index updated accordingly.

The other thing is that once a file is moved it is in a different place and users and applications that may wish to access the moved file can find it. One way for them to do that would be to use the global index because it must of necessity know where all the files are. This broadly speaking is the approach taken by Hammerspace which of course does much more than move files to cold storage.

Komprise has taken the decision that this is the wrong idea. It replaces the file’s address before it was moved with a dynamic link which points to the new location. As far as users and applications are concerned the file is in its original location and their way of accessing it need not change. This is called Transparent Move Technology.

We can see that Komprise is in the control plane so to speak for files its software has moved but not for files which it has not moved – the so-called hot data.

Deep analytics

Komprise can do more. The index can be queried to show how much capacity is taken up by files of particular classes and a graphical display created to show this. How many files are stored on Qumulo filers? What age are they? How many files have been accessed in the last day week month year and so on. Komprise says this is like a search plane as opposed to a control or data plane.

Its software can also be used to add tags to files to extend the metadata. Then you can answer questions such as “which image files contain the company logo or personal identity information (PII)” and do things with them. You can set up workflows to have public cloud services such as AWS Lambda functions act on subsets of data. Or delete emails by ex-employees that have not been read in 3 years. Such activities are called Deep Analytics Actions. There is API access to these actions and Python scripts can be used to connect data services.

A UK Police Department Digital Forensics unit is using Komprise Deep Analytics to locate and copy files during investigations meanwhile keeping them accessible on lower-cost cold storage.

Komprise’s global index does not have an intrinsic hot/cold data boundary. It knows about file age and file access history but it doesn’t do anything with that information apart from find it and display it. It is not a data mover. That is the function of Komprise’s data management services software and it is only kicked into action when users set policies and have them applied.

The two main benefits of Komprise’s software are to save cost by transparently moving less-accessed files to cheaper storage with 60–75 per cent cost savings possible and to enable a much better way to find and then process information needles in the giant file and object haystacks that litter an organisation’s global multi-silo IT infrastructure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudGVycHJpc2VzdG9yYWdlZm9ydW0uY29tL21hbmFnZW1lbnQvZGVsbC10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMtY2FyZWVycy1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review of Dell Storage Careers | ESF,"Enterprise Storage Forum content and product recommendations are editorially independent.

As described above the security of Ethereum (and many other cryptocurrencies) is based on the one-way relation between the private key and the address. A quantum computer using Shor’s algorithm is expected to break the one-way relation between the private and the public keys. This is the first step in Figure 1 The relation between the public key and the address is only partially impacted3. This means that a quantum computer can only derive the private key associated with a specific address if the public key is already known. This is only the case if the address has been used before to send funds.

We define quantum-exposed funds as coins residing in addresses where the public key is already published in the blockchain (through a transaction). Funds in addresses where the public key is not known (if funds have never been transferred out of the address) are not exposed and are safe against currently known quantum attacks.

The unique way cryptography is used in cryptocurrencies (public keys are not always public) results in two distinct types of attacks: the storage attack and the transit attack.

Storage attack

In this attack a malicious actor will search for funds that are stored in quantum-exposed addresses. They will then use a quantum computer to derive the private key associated with the vulnerable address which will allow them to transfer the funds to a new address that is not vulnerable to a quantum attack.

Finding quantum-exposed funds is particularly easy in the Ethereum blockchain. Each node in the network keeps a balance sheet called the world state with all addresses that have ever been used and a counter that shows how many times they were used to transfer funds from. An attacker can simply look for all addresses in the world state where the counter is larger than 0. From the resulting list the attacker picks a target address with plenty of funds. Next they scan the blockchain for a transaction sent by this specific address and use it to obtain the corresponding public key. As explained before after having obtained the public key the attacker can now use a quantum computer to derive the private key and steal the funds from the targeted address.

We performed an analysis on the Ethereum blockchain to find out how many coins would be vulnerable to this type of attack. For the purpose of this analysis we are focusing solely on Ethereum’s native token Ether and ignore other third party tokens implemented on Ethereum. Despite being ignored in this analysis tokens implemented using the ERC20 standard that are stored in quantum-exposed addresses would also be vulnerable to the storage attack.

In Figure 2 we see the result of the analysis showing the total number of Ether in circulation over time distinguishing between those in quantum-exposed addresses and those in non quantum-exposed addresses. From the data it is clear that currently over 65% of all Ether are vulnerable to a quantum attack and this number has been continuously increasing. This is a significantly larger percentage than the 25% we found for the Bitcoin blockchain in a previous analysis1.

The difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is primarily caused by the fact that the Bitcoin architecture is based on generating a new address for each transaction (known as the “UTXO model”).

This example shows how you can use Google Cloud Function to generate open graph images from Google Slides template in Google Drive. You may open any page on this website and look for the og:image meta tag in the head to see the generated image that is different for each image.

When the cloud function is invoked the input text is provided in the query string and this replaces the {{Title}} placeholder in the template to generate the customized image. The generated image is stored in Google Cloud storage and the file’s public URL is returned.

Create a Service Account

Go to console.cloud.google.com and create a new Google Cloud project. While the project is selected go to APIs & Services > Credentials > Create credentials and select Service Account .

Give your service account a name and grant the Project > Owner role to the service account.

Your service account will have an email address like <project-id>-<service-account-name>@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com .

Create a Service Account Key

In the Google Cloud Console click the email address for the service account that you have created in the preview step. Click Keys > Add Key > Create new key. A JSON file will be downloaded to your computer. Make sure you add this file to the .gitignore file as it contains the private key and should not be committed to the repository.

You can also pass the authentication credentials to the cloud function by setting the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the path of the JSON file.

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = ""/path/to/service-account.json""

Enable the Google Cloud APIs

Go to APIs & Services > Library and enable the Google Slides API and the Google Drive API for your cloud project.

Create a Google Slides Template

Go to Google Slides and create a new presentation containing a single slide. Add a text box containing the text {{TITLE}} and ensure that the Resize shape to fit text option is checked since we may have a long title as well.

Add the service account email as an editor to the Google Slides presentation.

Create a Google Drive Folder

Create a new folder in your Google Drive and share it with the service account email. This folder will be used to store the slide templates that are used to generate the open graph images.

Make a note of the ID of the folder and the Slides template created in the previous step.

Create a Cloud Storage Bucket

Switch to Google Cloud Storage and create a new bucket for storing the generated images. Please note that billing must be enabled in your Google Cloud project for using this feature.

Write the Google Cloud Function

Initialize a new project in your local disk with the npm init command and add the code to the index.js file. We create our own signed JWT from the service account’s private key and then exchange the JWT for an Access Token to authenticate the Google APIs.

const fetch = require ( 'node-fetch' ) ; const { google } = require ( 'googleapis' ) ; const { client_email  private_key } = require ( './creds.json' ) ; const { Storage } = require ( '@google-cloud/storage' ) ; const { client_email  private_key } = require ( './creds.json' ) ; const jwtClient = new google . auth .

Last Chance Saloon to be The Mann.

Everybody knows that Daboll worked magic with Josh Allen in Buffalo. While no one should expect the apple of former general manager Dave Gettleman’s eye to automatically join the upper echelon of elite quarterbacks this will be his opportunity once and for all to make the franchise believe in earnest that he can truly be the franchise quarterback who followed Eli Manning.

Daboll isn’t just a creative and innovative offensive mind whose time is past due he is a builder of relationships and a man of empathy and compassion whom Allen — and Buffalo’s offensive players — respected and adored.

“Players don’t care how much you know” Daboll said once “until they know how much you care. I think that’s an important quality that I try to be better at every year.”

Daboll wasn’t hired strictly to lift Jones higher. The Giants want and need him to be the CEO and leader they believed Joe Judge to be before the clown show arrived at the end of this past season.

But Daboll marching in lockstep as a partner with new GM Joe Schoen promises to give Jones a warm and fuzzy feeling — and it doesn’t hurt that Daboll just might be able to bring the Giants’ offense back from the dead and find the end zone without the need for a Seeing Eye dog.

The Real Daniel Jones must stand up in his fourth season or Daboll will be whispering sweet nothings to a different quarterback in 2023.

Ready Willing and Daboll.

“I’d like to say that I’m a leader” Daboll said once. “You have to develop relationships with your players but you also have to set a standard and an expectation that you are going to hold them accountable to. Once a player can trust you and you earn their respect they’re more accountable to you.”

There were times when Daboll showed Allen tough love on the sideline and their bond was unbreakable.

“I think teams would be foolish not to offer Brian Daboll a job” Allen said Monday. “I’m praying they don’t because I want him back here but I love him and his family too much to really think that.

“I think he’s one of the best coaches in the league.”

The jury remains out on Jones following the neck injury that cost him the final six games of this past season. Judge’s offensive coordinator woes and the wretched state of the Giants’ offensive line both helped sabotage his career. The Giants — from John Mara to Schoen on down — love Jones’ dual-threat physical tools and intangibles and they will hope and pray that Daboll will be able to unlock the promise Jones showed as a rookie under Pat Shurmur.

In Mara’s mind Jones is not a 12-25 quarterback.

When Daboll lost his grandmother in September Allen and the Bills rallied behind him and for him with a 43-21 win over Washington.

“He’s a guy that I love dearly and to go out there and play the way we did for him the guys understood that and we wanted to go and execute and play well for him” Allen said.

Sometimes you just know or you believe you know. Mike Tomlin Kyle Shanahan Sean McVay John Harbaugh Sean Payton Jimmy Johnson Andy Reid. Somebody knew.

Or somebody got lucky. Because there is always an element of luck involved. There have been countless can’t-miss hotshots who missed for example. The Giants haven’t been lucky lately. Ben McAdoo Shurmur Judge. Ray Handley right after Bill Parcells.

So while it is impossible to shout “Super Bowl here we come!” from the top of the Empire State Building — the top of the Quest Diagnostics Training Center is far more realistic — Daboll’s hiring by the bright new GM signals the dawn of a new day and a time for whipsawed Giants fans to trust that Schoen got it right and keep their fingers crossed that the merciless football gods will now concede that the law of averages is on their side.

After too many years of Dumb and Dumber the glass-half-full Giants fan is saying today: “So you’re telling me there’s a chance.”

Yes I’m telling you there’s a chance.

I would have told you there was a chance with Brian Flores too.

Schoen has to evaluate the hell out of the players in the draft and Daboll has to coach the hell out of his players — and hire better offensive coaches than Judge did.

“Always hire somebody you know” the late George Young said once. “That way you have a good idea of what the person’s like. No surprises.”

Schoen hired someone he knew. Parcells and Bill Belichick weren’t options. The Giants landed two Bills anyway.

“You hire somebody with a high energy level” Young also said. “And something to prove.”

Daboll who will turn 47 in April has plenty to prove. That he is more than an offensive coordinator. That he is more than just a quarterback whisperer. That the lessons he learned under Belichick and Nick Saban will steel him to weather the inevitable storms.

Lauren will make an undisclosed capital investment in the asset manager’s Franklin Venture Partners unit which focuses on mid- and late-stage private companies.

More from WWD

Franklin Ventures will look to put the money to work at consumer technology firms with a particular focus on companies led by women. In addition to marching toward greater gender equality Lauren said it would get a chance to “collaborate with others to develop and deploy new technologies.”

Lauren has taken a similar approach of investing and partnering to build in a new area before. In 2020 the company made a minority investment in sustainable material start-up Natural Fiber Welding Inc. which is working on turning natural fibers such as cotton waste into high-performance materials.

By working with Franklin Ventures on consumer technology the company opens itself to a world of innovation where the players are often peeking over the horizon and looking at what comes next.

“The powerful combination of honoring our heritage while embracing innovation has guided our brand and business for decades” said Patrice Louvet Ralph Lauren’s president and chief executive officer. “Participating in opportunities like this one with Franklin Venture Partners is one example of how we are pursuing new pathways for innovation and we are excited to support the growth of these companies and benefit from insights and technology that can help guide our company and our industry’s future.”

Ralph Lauren helped define and lead an age of fashion that was characterized by big department store presentations and flashy magazine ads.

But now that the game has changed — and is continuing to change at a blinding pace — Lauren is making sure to stay out front from sustainability to the metaverse.

Last month Lauren launched an all-digital Roblox exclusive collection — and used it as another opportunity to connect the brand’s past with its future.

The collection drew inspiration from the signature Polo Sport line from the 1990s and was available at the Ralph Lauren Winter Escape virtual holiday destination.

COVID Impact and Recovery Analysis

The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 hindered the growth of the regional menswear market.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)

Tom Brady will technically retire as a champion considering this year’s Super Bowl is still weeks away and while he only played seven games in his career against Washington’s football team (4-2 in the regular season 1-0 in the playoffs) he was a player in Washington politics over the past few years.

The 7-time Super Bowl winning quarterback and sure-fire hall of famer will retire after 22 seasons per ESPN’s Adam Schefter and Jeff Darlington and The Boston Globe citing unnamed sources.

His friendship with former President Trump thrust Brady into the Beltway spotlight during Trump’s first campaign for President and his joke last year over his friend’s 2020 election denial brought laughter at Trump’s expense.

Brady was seen with Trump’s iconic red MAGA hat in his locker two months after Trump announced his candidacy and Brady appeared to endorse Trump soon thereafter only to later say his words were taken out of context.

In 2017 after Trump won the presidency Brady said his comments about NFL players protesting police brutality and inequality were “divisive” and that he disagreed with Trump saying that players who were kneeling should be fired. Earlier that year Brady skipped out on visiting the White House for a celebration of his Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots citing “personal family matters.”

And last year after Brady moved to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and helped them win the Super Bowl Brady mocked Trump’s lie about winning the 2020 presidential election.

""Not a lot of people think that we could have won. In fact I think about 40% of people still don't think we won. You understand that Mr. President?"" Brady said to the laughing crowd.

""I understand that"" President Biden replied.

And while Brady may no longer lead a 4th quarter comeback -- again -- and be one of the NFL’s most polarizing stars he could still be a political player. During a 2005 interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” he said he had an interest in politics and would consider running for office in the future if he was still interested in it.

“If that chance does come up and I'm still interested in it I mean it would be something that I think I could do a decent job at” he said. “When you think about things you like to do you think about things that you could be good at and that's one thing I think I could be good at. Whether I do it or not I don't know. Who does?""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvdG9tLWJyYWR5LW1pbGxpb25zLXJldGlyZW1lbnQtbG9vbXPSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3RvbS1icmFkeS1taWxsaW9ucy1yZXRpcmVtZW50LWxvb21zLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Brady set to be paid millions as retirement reports loom,"Tom Brady may be retiring after 22 seasons in the NFL with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Even still he’s set to be paid handsomely in the coming days.

Brady initially signed a two-year contract with the Buccaneers before the start of the 2020 season. He would later sign a one-year extension through the 2022 season with three voided years for salary cap purposes. The contract included a no-trade clause and a no-franchise or transition tag clause.

According to Spotrac $15 million of Brady’s $20 million signing bonus was deferred to Feb. 4 2022. If Brady retires the Buccaneers could recoup up to $16 million of his signing bonus. Should Brady decide to continue to the 2022 season Spotrac notes his entire salary would be guaranteed on Feb. 18 but voided if he decides to retire.

There’s a ton of money tied to Brady’s decision.

But beyond money what Brady does next will determine what the team does in the future. Tampa Bay will have the No. 27 pick of the draft and wide receiver Chris Godwin could be a free agent this offseason as well.

TOM BRADY RETIREMENT REPORT SPARKS CONFUSION DENIALS

Retirement speculation around Brady heated up on Saturday when ESPN reported that the legendary quarterback was going to retire. But that apparently wasn’t the case.

Brady 44 informed Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht in a phone call that he has not made a decision on his future the Associated Press reported. Bally Sports first reported the call from Brady to Licht.

And Brady’s agent Don Yee told ESPN the quarterback would make the final announcement.

""I understand the advance speculation about Tom’s future. Without getting into the accuracy or inaccuracy of what’s being reported Tom will be the only person to express his plans with complete accuracy"" Yee said in the statement. ""He knows the realities of the football business and planning calendar as well as anybody so that should be soon.""

Tom Brady Sr. told KRON-TV the reports of his son’s retirement were untrue.

""This story Mike is total conjecture"" Brady Sr. told NFL Network. ""Tommy has not made a final decision one way or the other and anybody else that says that he has is absolutely wrong.""

Brady’s representatives and the Buccaneers didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News. Brady who usually shares any and all announcements on his social media did not post about his retirement.

Bucs coach Bruce Arians told ESPN the quarterback hadn't decided anything.

With a lot of money to be decided over the next few weeks a decision will have to come fairly soon.

Editor’s note: Previous story tied Tom Brady’s bonus incentive to whether he decides to retire before Feb. 4 which doesn’t appear to be case."

Whether you’re looking for a gaming laptop capable of the latest ray tracing capabilities or something more mid-tier Nvidia offers a range of options in today’s best gaming laptops . But which of Nvidia’s many chips is right for you? Are you a mobile professional that does a little gaming on the side or a hardcore gamer who’s looking to squeeze every bit of power out of their system? Or are you somewhere in between? No matter how you identify our handy explainer will help you choose the best Nvidia 30-series GPU for you.

High-end gaming ray tracing: Nvidia GeForce RTX 30-Series

Currently at the top of the heap among Nvidia graphics cards is the RTX 30-series. Based on the latest Ampere architecture the 30-series pushes forward the impressive ray tracing technology introduced in the previous generation 20-series cards. Let’s take a look at the keys stats spanning seven SKUs. The top row is the GPU’s name higher numbers in the name indicate a more powerful card. Card names ending in “Ti” are superior to the non-Ti version of the same model number.

Nvidia 30-Series chart breakdown: For nerds and the curious

Nvidia CUDA cores are highly specialized processing units in Nvidia GPUs used by many programming languages to more easily leverage the compute power of the GPU which is already a very specialized component of any computer. These cores are tasked with doing lots of floating point math  a very compute-intensive process used in 3D rendering. A higher CUDA core count generally indicates a more capable GPU.

A GPU’s Boost Clock measured in megahertz is the performance speed of the GPU at its peak when under the heaviest workloads it can manage. A GPU can “boost” itself to a faster clock speed for a period of time while remaining within thermal and power thresholds for short-term intensive tasks. This is essentially the highest speed at which the processor clock that governs all tasks can output a signal or instruction. The RTX 3080 at its listed boosted performance can output up to 1.59 million instructions a second. You’ll notice lower number cards can have higher listed clock speeds but with fewer compute cores and less available memory the card still won’t outperform its bigger siblings.

The listed GPU “subsystem” power measured in Watts is the rated power draw range of the card which can fluctuate as demands on the system rise and fall. This can play a large role in laptop battery life .

The memory configuration indicates the available Video RAM measured in Gigabytes used to store information needed in the short-term. While your laptop has its own RAM modern GPUs require dedicated VRAM often of similar amounts to do their job. Larger VRAM pools allow a GPU to store graphical instruction data in a place where access speeds are many times faster than reading from your hard drive or SSD. A lower amount of VRAM means more (relatively) slow trips to the SSD to pull down that data. More VRAM is always better. All 30-series cards come with the latest memory standard known as GDDR6 (Graphical Double Data Rate for you acronym nerds) which has rated transfer speeds of 16Gb/s.

The Ray Tracing Cores and Tensor Cores are indicated here as the current generation of those processing units. Ray Tracing Cores help with the very intensive work of rendering ray traced effects on surfaces in games. Tensor cores are another specialized part of the GPU responsible for doing the relational math between vertices and matrices needed for modern 3D graphical effects and are a key component of AI systems like DLSS .

Nvidia 30-Series summary: For everyone else

Don’t worry if not all of that landed the major take away from this is that Nvidia has seven very powerful GPUs on the market and while each higher model number generally outperforms the one below it there are some quirks in the 30-series when it comes to processor speed. This means you might not need to drop the money on a top-of-the-line RTX 3080 Ti and should check performance reviews of specific configurations before deciding bigger is better.

(Image credit: Nvidia)

The RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti are your high-end options that shouldn’t run any modern game below 60 frames per second. Examples include the MSI GE76 Raider for a hefty $4199 equipped with a 3080 Ti and a shiny new 12th Gen Alder Lake Intel CPU if you feel like blowing the doors off of everything. In our tests it ran Red Dead Redemption 2 at 82 fps. Then at half the price there’s the Acer Nitro 5  pairing an AMD Ryzen 6 5900HX CPU with an RTX 3080 for $2300 that also performs very well running Assassin's Creed Odyssey at 64 FPS at 1080p resolution on Highest settings.

Down the ladder but still very capable are the RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti cards.You should expect a solid price cut without much of a performance dip out of 3070s. The Alienware m15 R4 ran Assassin’s Creed Odyssey at 67 fps (see?) at 1080p but you pay that Alienware premium in this case at $2499. Same game Gigabyte Aorus 15G  same settings: 64 fps. Not too bad for $1799 but with some quality of life caveats as indicated in the review.

Next up and formerly the lowest performing of the 30-series cards is the RTX 3060. Laptops with these won’t break fps category records but they shouldn’t break the bank either. If you don’t demand more than a comfortable 60 FPS to run your latest games at-or-near high settings a 3060 should do you just fine. On our deals page  RTX 3060 equipped laptops can be found from $1199 up to $1899.

Lastly in the 30-series line are the newly added entry level RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti cards. These guys should get you over the line at 60 FPS unless you’re running a particularly taxing game at especially high settings. With fewer compute cores than the big boys the 3050s still have fast enough clock speeds to mean business. The best part about them of course is the price. RTX 3050 equipped laptops can range as low as $650 if you catch the right sale (this one’s sold out sorry for the tease!). But they don’t get much higher easily under $1000 for most configurations. At four times cheaper they’re certainly not four times less powerful than their 3080 counterparts so weigh your options accordingly.

New mid-tier options coming soon

Coming to laptops in early 2022 from Nvidia are a selection of three mid-tier graphics card options for lightweight configurations capable of some high-end graphical settings like Ray Tracing while keeping power draw weight and heat concerns low.

MSI GE76 Raider (Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Information on which brands will come equipped with the new GeForce discrete GPUs hasn’t yet been announced and even some of the specs for the cards aren’t fully known yet but here’s what we do know about these cards.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 2050: A 30-series card in all but name

The confusingly designated RTX 2050 isn’t based on the previous 20-series Turing architecture as might be surmised by the name. RTX 2050 cards actually run on the Ampere architecture just like the 30-series cards which makes the RTX 2050 for laptops more comparable to an RTX 3050 than an RTX 2060. At 2048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 VRAM it matches the RTX 3050 while having a smaller memory width at 64 bits compared to 128. Comparisons to the RTX 2060 are less evenly matched a 2060 has fewer CUDA cores at 1920 but higher memory capacity at 6 GB and a higher boost clock.

The goal of the RTX 2050 appears to be providing a lower power consumption graphics configuration on the latest Ray Tracing platform.

Nvidia GeForce MX570 and MX550: For lightweight performance

Not a lot has been revealed yet on the new MX GeForce laptop cards including no announced laptops that will come equipped with either card. The official announcement says to expect their arrival in Spring 2022 and in the meantime we have some preliminary statements and some speculation to tide us over.

The MX line represents a low-spec but still meaningful upgrade in performance over integrated graphics so the chief comparison that MX-equipped laptops have is against laptops with no dedicated GPUs at all. Although the performance of integrated graphics is in a much better place today than it was not long ago any next-gen gaming still requires a dedicated GPU as do most rendering software applications.

The new MX570 will feature “more power-efficient CUDA Cores and with faster memory speeds than previous MX GPUs” according to the Nvidia announcement. The information on the lower-spec MX 550 isn’t any more detailed stating simply that it will have “more CUDA Cores and faster memory speeds than before”. The most recently released MX GPU the MX450 was released in August 2020 and is of Turing design with 2 GB of GDDR6 memory on a 64 bit memory bus with a base clock of 1.3 GHz and a boost clock of 1.5 GHz. So expect a generational uplift from those modest numbers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYXUucGNtYWcuY29tL2dyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLzkyMTYwL2ZpcnN0LWxvb2stYWxsLXRoZS1udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA1MC1jYXJkcy1zby1mYXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Look: All the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Cards So Far,"Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 3050 family of low-end graphics cards is finally ""here."" If you’ve been shopping for a graphics card anytime in the last two years you know why those quote marks are there: You'll have hunt hard to find any of them. From most sources initial RTX 3050 card stocks sold out almost instantly on Jan. 27 and availability is sure to remain tight in the coming days and weeks. Nonetheless the new cards are out there like rarely spotted nocturnal animals and some interesting trends have emerged with this launch that we should discuss. (Some we hope will not continue.)

The RTX 3050 in a Twisted Market

Due to the immense popularity of cryptocurrency mining graphics cards have been in painfully short supply for years now. Miners buy up most models any chance they get; so have opportunists who have been buying them for resale at steeply elevated prices. This has created what will probably be remembered as a dark age for PC gamers and builders.

Base cards in the RTX 3050 line according to Nvidia are supposed to sell for $249.99 with models ranging up from there. Its card-making partners faced with these market trends have set the MSRPs on many of their step-up cards much higher. Some base-spec cards from every card OEM are indeed set at $249.99 MSRP; the card makers appear to be making some effort to have some cards at that price. But most enhanced models have been priced—list price that is!—significantly higher from $300 to almost $500. For many of the cards that's a way bigger percentage increase over base price than we've ever seen from a budget card line.

EVGA GeForce RTX 3050 XC Black Gaming 8G

Given the market you could call it profiteering but we see it differently almost necessitated by market pressures. And it may help to keep cards on shelves longer in the long run. That is because there is less of a price gap between these higher-priced GeForce RTX 3050 cards and the next cards up from AMD and Nvidia the AMD Radeon RX 6600 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 which gives scalpers less reason to buy into the RTX 3050. While you may end up paying more it might also lead to a less frustrating shopping experience for everyone as stocks of these cards improve over time.

That said there are still those $249.99-MSRP base models. Value-seekers should realistically try to track down one of those as in some cases the only difference between a model that’s $249.99 at MSRP and a model that’s $399.99 at MSRP is just 30MHz of GPU clock. In a case like that you will almost certainly not see a performance benefit proportional to the price though that higher price may still be worth it if it saves you countless hours and possibly weeks of shopping around.

To be clear you’ll see benefits to some of the cards that are priced higher including better thermal hardware. But you’ll want to look closely at those cards and read our analyses on the cards below to get a better idea of the possible payoff.

A Quick Look at the GeForce RTX 3050 Reference Design

With that said let’s go over the details of Nvidia’s reference design for the RTX 3050 before getting into the designs from the OEMs. For the GeForce RTX 3050 Nvidia didn’t create a true reference design that OEMs could copy from head to toe as they often do with higher-end cards. That’s to say there is no Nvidia-branded GeForce RTX 3050 Founders Edition. Instead we’re left with a simple list of specs that every card will adhere to with some minor variations.

All GeForce RTX 3050 graphics cards have 2560 CUDA cores that connect to 8GB of GDDR6 RAM over a 128-bit memory interface. The RAM is clocked at 14000MHz and so far none of the OEM graphics cards has deviated from this spec. The GPU core has a base clock of 1550MHz and a boost clock of 1777MHz. All of the current OEM cards priced at $249.99 MSRP operate at this base frequency. So do some of the higher-priced cards but you will see some models factory-overclocked as well.

Closer Look

GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3070 features the GA104 GPU with 17400M transistors on 8nm technology a 392mm² die size and 96 ROPs and 184 TMUs. It boasts 5888 shader units a Pixel fill rate of 174.2 GP/s and a Texture fill rate of 334 GT/s. The 8GB GDDR6 VRAM from SAMSUNG runs at 1750MHz with a 256-bit bus width providing a bandwidth of 448 GB/s. The card supports PCIe 4.0 with backward compatibility has an ATX form factor and a maximum digital resolution of 7680×4320.

It is time to take a closer look at the design of the graphics card and then I will discuss the results of the gaming and synthetic benchmarks. The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3070 features a 2.5-slot design measuring 286x115x51mm (LxWxH). The sleek and stylish shroud has a silver-finished faceplate around the fan mounts occasionally resembling gold with a white borderline. Equipped with 3x 80mm fans each featuring white blades.

The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface effectively enhancing the airflow. The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low-load or low-power game. It allows gamers to enjoy gameplay in complete silence when the system is running light or idle.

In my testing I have enjoyed silent gaming with good thermals on the graphics card clearly evidencing the power and effectiveness of the WINDFORCE 3X cooling solution employed on this GeForce RTX 3070 Review. The fans use Graphene Nan lubricant which extends the service life by 2.1 times.

The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3070 showcases a WINDFORCE 3X cooling system with 3x 80mm fans 5 composite copper heat pipes and a direct-touch heatsink. The black PCB is nestled between a metal backplate and shroud ensuring efficient heat dissipation for optimal performance and lower temperatures. The heatsink’s direct contact with the GPU VRAM chips and power delivery components reflects a smart design approach.

GIGABYTE’s WINDFORCE 3X cooling system employs 80mm fans with the middle fan rotating clockwise to eliminate turbulent airflow. Their patented ‘Alternate Spinning’ design ensures efficient heat dissipation by having all fans spin in the same direction reducing turbulence. Pure copper heat pipes maximize GPU contact for enhanced heat transfer covering VRAM through a large metal plate. Composite heat-pipes efficiently manage heat transfer boosting cooling capacity.

The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3070 features a white shroud extending over half of the front with ‘GEFORCE RTX 3070 Review’ in gray font. The backlit GIGABYTE branding controlled by RGB FUSION 2.0 adds a multi-shade purple lining. The metallic backplate extends over the top and two power connectors—a 6-pin PCIe and an 8-pin—are located towards the front.

Looking at the base of the graphics card there is a whole lot of vented area available there and we can spot the fin stack. The shroud is in a white color over here. The thermal pads seem to be in white color and from the looks of it GIGABYTE has used thin thermal pads. There are two black color headers in parallel to each other. They are probably to power the fans and the RGB LEDs.

The above picture shows the PCIe connector of the graphics card. As mentioned above the card is based on a PCIe 4.0 interface with backward compatibility. GIGABYTE’s GeForce RTX 3070 boasts a solid metallic silver backplate for enhanced strength and aesthetics complementing the VISION series theme. ‘VISION’ is stylishly printed at the center ‘GEFORCE RTX’ towards the top with a vented portion on the top for improved airflow.

GIGABYTE’s GeForce RTX 3070 features ‘Screen Cooling’ embossed on the heatsink’s vented area extending over the PCB for effective heat dissipation. The white-finished front end with a dotted pattern lacks ventilation but contributes to an aesthetically pleasing and symmetrical design.

This graphics card is using 8-pin and 6-pin power connectors. There is a large gap between both connectors. I noticed that the connectors housed in a plastic frame are flimsy so take care of connecting/disconnecting the cables. GIGABYTE has opted for a concealed design over the connectors. While this makes sense given the overall layout they should have strengthened the housing.

Following connectivity options are available at the user’s disposal:

2x HDMI port 2.1

2x DP ports 1.4a

I did not open the card so I am not sure about the power phases. According to GIGABYTE the design allows the MOSFET to operate at a lower temperature and over-temperature protection design and load balancing for each MOSFET plus the Ultra Durable certified chokes and capacitors to provide excellent performance and longer system life. GIGABYTE has employed their Ultra-Durable technology in the power delivery design.

The fully automated production process has resulted in a friendly PCB design where the protrusions don’t have sharp ends over the solder connectors which reduces the risk of injury.

Synthetic Benchmarks

Synthetic Benchmarks 1 of 3

Overall the GIGABYTE RTX 3070 VISION OC is going neck-on-neck against the ZOTAC GeForce RTX 2080Ti.

Gaming Benchmarks

Gaming Benchmarks 1 of 17

Seeing the results the RTX 2080Ti has an upper hand over the RTX 3070 depending upon the title. But the competition is stiff between both Nvidia GPUs and the main point here is the pricing. The price point of RTX 3070 is way low as compared to the launched price of RTX 2080Ti with 2080Ti being the enthusiast-grade GPU gaming solution from the Nvidia.

WARNING: For high-end cards 1080p and 1440p resolutions testing will not give any performance indication on this game. Only the 4k testing will provide a better reference point. This is because FPS is limited to 200 counts and almost all high-end cards tend to reach this figure or near to it at lower resolutions..

Ray Tracing and DLSS Benchmarks

Let’s start with the synthetic benchmarks.

Ray Tracing and DLSS Benchmarks 1 of 14

Boost Clocks and Overclocking

The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3070 VISION OC has its power limit set to 100% and we can’t cross it beyond that. We are limited in terms of power to the board for the overclocking. The MSI Afterburner is used the overclocking starting with overclocking the VRAM.

Boost clocks and overclocking 1 of 3

The voltage slide was set at 100%. I was able to push the memory clock by another +1000MHz (1.0GHz). Next I started with the core clock overclocking. I met with no such good luck on the silicon as I was only able to push the core clock to +125MHz. The chip did reach 2100MHz but the sustained boost was 2045MHz.

Power Consumption

To measure the power draw I am taking a different route as HWInfo64 shows the GPU Power and this is exactly what I have been showing on my graphs instead of the overall system power draw. To monitor the maximum power draw I am using The Witcher 3 4k run of 60 minutes and then record the reported maximum power draw from the HWInfo64. The PC was set to idle for like 15 minutes before the gaming session. This way any user can check their graphics card for power consumption easily.

The RTX 3070 was drawing more power than the RTX 2080. This card like the other RTX graphics cards that I have tested was constantly hitting the power target.

Thermal Performance

I am not using Furmark or any other stress app for thermal performance checking. Instead the reported temperatures are actually from the gaming session using The Witcher 3 at 4k resolution for a minimum of 60 minutes. MSI Afterburner is used to record the temperatures during the gaming session.

PRO TIP: Optimize the GeForce RTX 3070’s thermal performance with proper case ventilation and consider aftermarket cooling solutions for peak efficiency.

The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3070 VISION OC was idling at 30°C. On stock clocks it maxed to 68.2°C and with overclocking it maxed to 69°C. This is a very good performance from the graphics card showing the true cooling potential of the WINDFORCE 3X. This performance is coming at default fan settings.

Noise (Sound Level)



The maximum noise output recorded during the gaming session was 42 dBA which is too good to have. This performance is coming at default fan settings.

Compute Performance

Since the GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3070 VISION OC is more aimed at content creators and professionals we also ran a few rendering tests using the graphics card. Here are the results:

Should You Buy It?

After hours of testing would I recommend the GIGABYTE RTX 3070 VISION OC?

Buy It If:

✅You want to game at 1440p: The GeForce RTX 3070 VISION OC is a phenomenal graphics card for 1440p gaming at 60fps.

✅You want to benefit from Ray Tracing: Ray tracing performance is solid on the GeForce RTX 3070 especially when combined with DLSS 2.

✅You are building an all-white PC: The Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3070 Vision OC will make for a fantastic addition to an all-white build.

Don’t Buy It If:

❌You are working with a limited budget: Despite being a 70-class graphics card the GeForce RTX 3070 is by no means cheap.

❌You want to game at 4K: While 4K gaming on the GeForce RTX 3070 is possible you will require a higher-end card for a stable experience.

Conclusion

The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3070 VISION OC has performed well. This card definitely has the upper hand over the RTX 2080 RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2070 for that matter. In our testing we have seen RTX 2080Ti performing better depending on the title and sometimes this gain was marginal. We are seeing a locked power limit of 100%. This would reduce the overclocking headroom of this card and our overclocking attempt yields roughly 3.5% performance gain. This was with +1000 MHZ on the Memory and +125MHZ on the Core clock.

For Pascal users the RTX 3070 is a nice upgrade option from their GTX 1080 and GTX 1080Ti. Similarly we can spot the upgrade path of the RTX 2070/2070S/2080 users particularly at 1440P gaming. In the end this would come down to the personal preferences and budget of the individual concerned. The 4K gaming is also possible with the RTX 3070 though one would need to lower the graphics settings a bit.

On the appearance side of things the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3070 Vision looks amazing. The distinctive feature is the VISION-themed shroud and white color of the graphics card giving one heck of a spectacular look. This is further augmented by the silver color metallic backplate with Screen Cooling. We are also doing a white build for which we bought a GIGABYTE Z490 VISION G motherboard and this card is a perfect addition to that.

We are thankful to GIGABYTE for giving us the opportunity to review their GeForce RTX 3070 VISION OC graphics card.

We know you’ve heard of a Costco card but maybe you’ve passed it up because of the annual membership fee. Gold Star and Business memberships are $60 a year while the Executive Membership is $120 a year. All memberships come with a free Household Card that you can assign to someone else living with you (or working with for a Business Membership) provided they’re over 18.

Though it might seem unreasonable to pay for a membership to a retail store it’s been reported that you can save over $90 each time you go to Costco rather than heading to your local grocery store. This more than makes up for that annual fee. Need some more convincing? Below is a list of reasons why you should join 100 million others and get a Costco membership if you want to save money in 2022.

Price Codes Tell You Where the Deals Are

It’s important to look closely at the prices at Costco particularly the last two digits because then you’ll know when you’re getting the best deal. If you’re looking to buy something that ends in .99 that means it’s a wholesale price. However if it ends in .97 that means that’s the best discount you’ll be able to find so it’s even lower than the original wholesale price. Now you can always feel confident knowing you’re getting the lowest possible price on the items you’re buying.

FILE PHOTO: The ticker and trading information for Blackstone Group is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) April 4 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid//File Photo

The company reported “the most remarkable results in our history on virtually every metric” said Blackstone co-founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman as the company announced its fourth quarter earnings results.

Blackstone said its $280 billion real estate business was responsible for approximately half of its profits last year.

Blackstone has made big investments in rental housing logistics and life science office complex which account for around 70% of its equity portfolio. Rents in all three sectors have been rising at two-to-three times the rate of inflation the company said.

With the boom in e-commerce due to the pandemic there has been a rush to find logistics hubs and warehouses to meet that demand. Vacant properties are more difficult to find sending rents and prices up.

At the same time Blackstone has pushed aggressively into rental housing the Real Deal reported. For instance it recently said it would buy around $1 billion worth of affordable single-family rental homes adding around 4000 such properties to its portfolio in the next two years.

At present around 80% of Blackstone’s real estate portfolio consists of rental housing and logistics. The company said in the earnings call both sectors are better insulated from inflationary pressures with their shorter-term leases.

“Blackstone’s fourth-quarter results represented a remarkable finish to a record-breaking year” Schwarzman said.

Blackstone nearly doubled its net income to $2.9 billion since the fourth quarter of 2020. Its real estate investment trust and its Core+ business accounted for the majority of those increases. Its real estate ventures appreciated by 12% and its Core+ segment by 7.2% The Real Deal reports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wZXJyaWUtZWR3YXJkcy1lbmpveXMtYmVhY2gtZGF5LTIyMjUzODE1My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perrie Edwards Enjoys Beach Day with 5-Month-Old Baby Boy Axel: 'You Are My Sunshine',"Perrie Edwards Shows Off Baby Boy: 'You Are My Sunshine'

The Boston Celtics took their last two games before they went on the road to face the Atlanta Hawks to heart smashing both the Washington Wizards and Sacramento Kings to pieces at TD Garden in convincing fashion in what was up that point their most complete games of the season.

In what should have been an ideal opportunity to show the lessons they had learned about how to play the game consistently regardless of the opponent in front of them or the arena dome over their heads the Celtics instead fell on their faces and fell back into old habits to hand the game on a platter to the Hawks.

What is going on with this team? Is it cursed to hover at .500 on the dreaded treadmill of mediocrity forever? Is there something internal that can be done to improve things? Or do there need to be minor medium or even major moves made to right the ship that is this Celtics roster?

On Saturday (29 January)People reported that the 54-year-old singer addressed her infamous Super Bowl Halftime show with Timberlake in 2004 in her forthcoming Lifetime documentary eponymously titled special Janet.

Timberlake had ripped off a piece of Jackson’s clothing and exposed her breast to millions of viewers while the two performed “Rock Your Body” during the Super Bowl Halftime show.

Jackson’s position in the industry had been adversely impacted in the aftermath of the incident which was known as “Nipplegate” while Timberlake’s own solo career had soared.

“Honestly this whole thing was blown way out of proportion. And of course it was an accident that should not have happened but everyone is looking for someone to blame and that’s got to stop” Jackson said in a clip from the documentary.

The “Better Days” singer also revealed they had “moved on” from the incident adding that “it’s time for everyone else to do the same.”

“Justin and I are very good friends and we will always be very good friends” Jackson told fans in a clip recorded in Miami earlier this year.

During a conversation with her brother Randy in Janet Jackson also recalled advising Timberlake against issuing a statement amid the backlash to their performance.

“We talked once and [Justin] said ‘I don’t know if I should come out and make a statement’” the singer told Randy continuing “And I said ‘Listen I don’t want any drama for you. They’re aiming all of this at me.’”

“So I said ‘If I were you I wouldn’t say anything’” the youngest Jackson sibling recounted.

Earlier this week a source close to the production revealed that Timberlake will make a ‘surprise’ appearance in Jackson’s highly anticipated documentary special.

According to a Page Six report the source said: “Justin is in [the documentary]. It’s like this big secret. He’s the surprise just like the Super Bowl.”

Jackson who was headlining the Super Bowl show brought Timberlake on as a surprise guest for her half-time performance in 2004.

The “Cry Me A River” singer had issued an apology to Jackson and Britney Spears last year as scrutiny over his past “missteps” intensified following the release of the Framing Britney Spears documentary.

“I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem where I spoke out of turn or did not speak up for what was right” Timberlake wrote on Instagram in February 2021. “I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism.”

Timberlake added a specific apology to Spears and Jackson writing: “I care for and respect these women and I know I failed.”

In addition to Timberlake Mariah Carey Missy Elliott Janelle Monáe Paula Abdul and Tyler Perry are also expected to appear in the documentary which will be available to watch on Sky Documentaries and NOW from Monday 31 January."

Global trade has been rocked by seismic changes to supply chains and subdued economic outputs over the course of the Covid pandemic; but increased innovation and digitalization of trade finance has ensured that businesses can still operate and provide a more sustainable future with greater transparency which bodes well for a new trade finance ecosystem.

Trade finance is playing an increasingly crucial role in supporting companies’ efforts in meeting environmental social and governance (ESG) targets and opportunities be it from paperless processes or green financing; and these are being enabled by the digital efforts of both banks and technology companies.

According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) the global trade finance gap hit an all-time high of $1.7 trillion due to Covid—with small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) hardest hit accounting for 40% of rejected trade finance requests. ADB highlights the role of digitalization in streamlining onboarding processes for SMEs and opening new sources of liquidity. Digital innovation can make the entire trade ecosystem more efficient more inclusive and less costly. The pandemic has brought additional urgency to the need to solve the hurdles hindering fragile supply chains and the financing of trade.

For banks digitalization offers a reduction in operating costs and more accurate records of transactions which can be used to provide trade insights. It also provides more reliable and instant know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks which can cut compliance costs.

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret scanned documents and check them against a set of predefined rules and regulations allows banks to focus on the anomalies highlighted by AI rather than spend their time on labor-intensive reading of documents manually and other repetitive tasks that take up much of their time. Benefits are not limited to banks. All parties across trade transactions benefit from reduced costs greater fraud mitigation and the optimization of working capital.

The use of optical character recognition (OCR) machine learning and neural language processing significantly lowers errors in trade-related documentation while the consolidation of digital trade documentation into a single electronic file brings further efficiencies to the multiple parties in various jurisdictions including trading partners financial institutions credit insurers shipping companies customs and other services providers.

The digital ledger of transactions created on a blockchain provides trade participants with all the necessary trade information in one digital document. Blockchain also creates the means to perform sustainability screening and verification which could help scale up the delivery of green trade finance and sustainability-linked trade finance deals such as the one announced between HSBC and clothing company Epic Group which ties pricing to ESG targets including greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater use intensity.

While the world was forced to close borders and become more insular interoperability between players and platforms has offered a way forward for all participants in trade finance where cooperation promises a more inclusive and less fragmented approach to trade.

Last year the World Bank said that to fully reap the benefits of new technologies the entire trade ecosystem—banks regulators border agencies trade bodies and corporates—must work together to apply digital innovation and drive efficiencies. This collaborative approach will help drive the future of trade finance and help meet substantiality objectives.

Methodology: Behind the Rankings

Global Finance editors select the winners for both the Trade Finance Awards and the Supply Chain Finance Awards with input from industry analysts corporate executives and technology experts. The editors also consider entries submitted by financial services providers as well as independent research taking into account a set of objective and subjective factors. This year’s ratings which cover 102 countries and eight regions were based on performance during the period from the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021.

It is not necessary to enter in order to win but experience shows that the additional information supplied in an entry can increase the chance of success. In many cases entrants are able to present details and insights that may not be readily available to the editors of Global Finance.

The winners are those banks and providers that best serve the specialized needs of corporations as they engage in cross-border trade. The winners are not always the biggest institutions but rather the best: those with qualities that companies should consider most carefully when choosing a provider. Global Finance uses a proprietary algorithm with criteria—such as knowledge of local conditions and customer needs financial strength and safety strategic relationships and governance competitive pricing capital investment and innovation in products and services—weighted for relative importance. Each entity is rated on each separate criterion. The algorithm incorporates those ratings into a single numeric score with 100 equivalent to perfection. In cases where more than one institution earns the same score we favor local providers over global institutions and privately-owned over government-owned institutions.

Shouldering the responsibility of maintaining the soundness of the state giant Muluneh says the bank is still resilient despite facing numerous challenges due to an increase in Non-Performing Loans caused by the conflict in Northern Ethiopia and slowdown in business activities due to the six-month suspension of loans which was lifted just a month ago.

As the Bank celebrates its 80th year anniversary with the inauguration of the tallest building in east Africa at a cost of seven billion birr Ashenafi Endale sat down with the veteran banker to understand what the future holds for the CBE. Excerpts:

The Reporter: How do you evaluate CBE’s performance since the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in northern Ethiopia?

Muluneh Aboye: Our market share of deposits was 54 percent in June 2020. Now it stands at 56 percent. Over the past year and a half CBE mobilized deposits more than the 20 commercial banks in the industry. Over the past six months the industry mobilized 122 billion birr. Of this 80 billion birr is mobilized by CBE. Regarding forex generation CBE’s performance is not bad either.

We planned 100 billion birr in loans this fiscal year. But the NPL is surging since clients are not servicing their loans due to the war in northern Ethiopia. This in turn is affecting CBE’s asset quality. The pandemic has also affected our international activities. Businesses were not performing well. So our NPLs are surging. And yet CBE is performing well on all other variables.

How much is the NPLs?

Most of the project finances and operational capital loans that we disbursed in northern Ethiopia have turned into a loss. Clients are unable to pay. Fresh disbursement stopped in these regions. Basically a loan is a NPL if it is not paid in 90 days making almost all the loans we disbursed in Tigray to be categorized under NPLs now.

Afar and Amhara are also partially similar. Some 234 branches in the three regional states are closed due to the war. Only a few branches in Amhara are working. CBE had 98 branches in Tigray. Currently we are compiling the NPL data.

The industry is facing liquidity problems even though loans were banned until recently. Is CBE also in a liquidity problem?

Liquidity concept is wrongly expressed in Ethiopia. If a bank executes its short term duties but fails to disburse fresh loans this is not a liquidity problem. Plus banks always have to meet the liquidity requirement of the regulatory body. Ethiopian banks have to maintain 15 percent liquidity. The problem is in the demand-supply gap. Savings could not meet the huge loan demands. But not all banks are facing shortages.

CBE’s liquidity position as of December 2021 was 29 percent twice the threshold of the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). In the industry there is no bank that failed to pay money whenever a depositor wanted to make a withdrawal. So there is no liquidity problem.

In cases of loanable money banks have to work on deposit mobilization. As the last resort banks can take capital from the central bank with interest if they face liquidity problems.

Regarding deposit mobilization industry aggregate showed a significant decline from last year. Of course deposits were at a historic high in the last year due to the currency redemption cash withdrawal and holding limits a cap on weekly transaction volume and a ban on fresh loans.

But this year deposits dropped substantially and forex inflow has also been affected. Apart from drop in banks’ resource mobilization informal transaction is also surging significantly.

During this time last year currency outside banks was around 70 billion birr. But currently it has doubled to 140 billion birr. More people are withdrawing deposits and using their money for informal cash-based transactions outside banks. It is a major obstacle to banks’ effort to mobilize resources.

The northern part of Ethiopia has been out of picture as there is no currency circulation there. So the money multiplier effect was low which indicates to banks not collecting money. As a result disbursement in fresh loans also dropped since last year.

Lately the central bank ordered commercial banks to provide two percent of their loans for coffee traders. Does not this indicate that the liquidity problem is serious this time?

This year the NBE introduced two directives. One limits banks’ lending capacity. This directive orders banks to allocate one percent of their loans to buy NBE bond. The second directive increased banks’ reserve ratio from five to 10 percent. Banks are ordered to give the two percent to coffee suppliers from the 10 percent of their reserve at the central bank. So it is not an additional pressure on banks.

The central banks also allowed banks to invest in Treasury bills. The new directive also allowed banks to invest in secondary markets.

Does the one percent mandatory rule to invest in NBE bonds include CBE?

We objected it should not apply to CBE since the CBE is a state bank and basically invests in government priority sectors. The CBE finances government’s policy and public projects more than the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE). So there is no reason to channel the one percent into DBE bonds. The central bank is discussing our case and soon we will know the decision. We are expecting the final directive.

The government established a Liability Asset Management Corporation (LAMC) to soak-up the half a trillion birr in loans the CBE extended to SOEs but not returned. How much room did the debt restructuring give to CBE?

SOEs loans are one of CBE’s risk areas. The problem is not the loan but SOEs inability to pay back the loan. Some SOEs abused the loans while others failed to materialize the projects after a long time.

The CBE is a state bank and it was forced to give those loans by the previous government. The bank gave those loans not willingly but under-pressure. Therefore the board of CBE has been pushing the government to solve the problem and restructure the loans.

The LAMC is absorbing the accumulated SOEs’ loans making the SOEs viable. Now the SOEs carry only the amount of loan they can pay making them productive. Accumulated loans of six SOEs is now shouldered by LAMC. The EEP EEU METEC ESC ERC are among the SOEs whose loan has been soaked by the Corporation easing the burden on CBE.

The corporation has already paid us around 35 billion birr. This improved CBE’s liquidity significantly. It is a big relief. SOEs’ viability to take additional loans has also improved. LAMC soaks the loan principal and also the interests.

The half a trillion birr loan was shifted from the SOEs to the LAMC. But basically the loan is not fully paid back to the CBE. So the burden on CBE is still there.

True the loan is not paid back to CBE but was shifted to the corporation. But the loan was shifted from SOEs that could not pay the loan to LAMC that can pay the loans. But in actual the LAMC paid us 35 billion birr in the first phase and all the rest of the loan will be paid gradually to CBE.

When we say the corporation has soaked up the loans it does not mean the loan is written-off from CBE’s loan account. The LAMC cannot pay the huge loan at once but gradually.

Some experts say the CBE has contributed to the growing inflation in Ethiopia especially since it increased its interest rates since last year.

CBE’s increments on interest rates and service charges are not that big compared to the industry rate. So the claims are baseless due to two reasons. First CBE’s loan to the private sector is much lower than the loan extended by private banks to the private sector. CBE’s market share in private lending is small and stands at 17 percent. Our rates increased mainly on the 17 percent which is small enough to inflict inflation. Corporate bond is given at nine percent.

Secondly the CBE revised its rates to cop-up with the industry average not more than the industry rates. Similarly the CBE usually provides forex for government’s priority imports like fuel medicine sugar fertilizer and others. So the increment on the forex commission rate is very insignificant to cause inflation.

The amount of forex we provide for the private sector is not that big. For a long time CBE had the lowest interest rates in the industry and some of our services were also free. But CBE’s operating cost has been skyrocketing as our branch expansion grows. Cost grew faster than revenue affecting profit.

Usually commercial banks take capital from the central bank with a lower interest and give the loan to clients with a higher interest rate. Why?

The NBE provides soft loans for commercial banks at times of liquidity. Commercial banks extend the money under whole lending scheme. But since COVID-19 the government made such loans to be provided at rates lower than saving interest rates.

The government is also rescheduling such loans for many times until industries and businesses improve. Still businesses are using the loans as operational capital but not paying to banks. This is good for the economy. But now businesses must pay their loans since the economy is improving.

Lately the number of branches opened by commercial banks is reducing. Is the Bank shifting from bricks and mortars to digital? If so how can it meet NBE’s annual 25 percent mandatory branch expansion rule?

The CBE did not fully shift from bricks and mortars to digital banking since banking penetration in Ethiopia is still very low. There are still many parts of the country where branches are more feasible than technology.

We planned to open 100 branches this year and achieved 90. This is low compared to our past trends of opening up to 300 branches per year. We have stopped that trend but did not stop opening new branches. We only reduced the pace. The CBE has reached most parts of the country. We will open branches only in new woredas and business areas.

Our major direction now is digitally financing products. This will cut CBE’s operational cost reduce the congestion at our branches enable faster services for clients and also modernize the economy.

Currently 50 percent of CBE’s total banking service is being provided through digital financial services. Branch based service constitutes less than two percent in Kenya. That is CBE’s plan. The government is also taking the lead by digitizing payments and the CBE is now focusing on digital financial services.

Yet branches remain important to mobilize deposits and handle customers and we will continue the branch expansion at a slower pace.

What are the new products planned? How much does CBE birr constitute out of the total transactions?

Most bank services in Ethiopia remain free of charge. A client is charged while withdrawing from ATMs but not at branches. The cost of serving at branches is high. But serving with ATM machine is much less costly. So I personally believe small services at branches should be charged more and if we want such small services we have to go digital. Branches should serve only big transactions.

We are preparing to introduce an Omnichannel. Internet banking mobile and wallet services will be provided on a single application. The bank is progressing in agent banking. And the future of CBE is simply in digital banking.

How much does an Omnichannel cost?

It is a new product application. It will consolidate previous applications into a single platform. Customers can access mobile internet wallet and card on a single application.

Is CBE planning to approve LCs soon?

We will approve LCs when the bank has sufficient forex. The forex reserve fluctuates. So we will wait for the good times.

Is the devaluation encouraging export performances bridging the wide exchange difference with the parallel market?

The government’s action is more decisive to end the black market. As long as there is forex demand-supply gap it is difficult to weaken the black market. Devaluation alone cannot solve the problem. Opening the forex market is also recommended to cut out the black market.

If the government begins to license illegal forex traders they will have no option but sell the forex to banks. The forex issue cannot be solved at once but policy measures are critical besides capitalizing on import substitutions and boosting exports.

How do you see the importance of the new Know Your Customer rule applied by the central bank?

The directive orders banks to re-profile all customers within six months. It is a big initiative that should have been done long ago. In Ethiopia it is number of accounts counted not number of clients. But the new directive states each customer must have a single unique identity despite having a number of accounts. So it will help us know the exact figures of financial inclusion cutting out the redundancies. We are working day and night to meet the deadline.

CBE is a giant in Ethiopia but in terms of USD it remains young among African banks. How do you evaluate the CBE?

All rating companies have different measurement methodologies. Last year the CBE ranked 17th from 100 African banks based on capital asset profit and other variables. They convert birr to dollar. But because our birr against the dollar has been appreciating our value in dollar remains smaller even though we are growing leaps and bounds.

There are rumors that foreign bank accounts owned by the Ethiopian government are closed in some countries due to the sanctions. Did it affect the bank?

I do not know Ethiopia’s foreign bank accounts are closed. Regarding CBE no account is affected due to the sanctions. No foreign bank has stopped correspondent relationship with the bank. Our biggest transactions are still with the US and Europe. Our dollar transaction is mainly with Citi bank. Our Euro and other currencies transaction is with Commerze Bank. We have a strong relation with all the others.

Is there a special plan regarding the 80th year anniversary?

Nothing special but we are set to launch a new strategy designed by a foreign firm. Secondly we will launch a new headquarter with all the headquarter works moving to the new building. But there are a lot of initiatives in the pipeline. We will introduce more services to become internationally competitive.

CBE is celebrating its 80th year while at the same moment; it is inaugurating the tallest building in east Africa with the biggest investment in Ethiopia. The CBE has passed through different stages in different regimes but has been the sole contributor to Ethiopia’s economy. The CBE was the only bank during the Derg regime.

The bank is an industry leader and influential in the economy. Its loans constitute 60 percent of the industry’s portfolio and managed to collect 56 percent of the total deposits mobilized. Though recently dropping 24 percent of the total bank branches is owned by the CBE and is the sole financer of mega projects in Ethiopia.

The building took seven billion birr. It has 53 floors including four basements. It is 203 meters tall. The China state construction company built it but the pandemic slowed down the pace of construction. Other buildings will generate additional revenue through rent. But since the CBE has eight banking districts in Addis Ababa we need even more buildings. Currently all the district offices are in rented buildings.

Studies show Ethiopian banks take around 230 percent in collateral to disburse loans. How can NPLs pile-up if banks always hold more than sufficient collaterals?

First the problem in Ethiopia is not in collaterals but in loan supply. There are many clients who have collateral but could not access loans. A few people are accessing loans because banks are facing high resource limitations.

Secondly collateral should not be the only requirement to give loans. If the business idea is viable financially and economically banks must provide the loans and banks need special schemes to replace collaterals. For instance government NGOs donors and the entrepreneurs can share the risks.

The NBE raised the paid-up capital to five billion birr. What do you think the impact is on new entrants? Do you see mergers happening? Is the competition getting stiffer?

Ethiopia’s banking industry is not stiff but there are times and conditions when it gets stiff. Existing banks barely scratched Ethiopia’s potential. There is a big resource limitation in banks. The competition is only in urban and on corporate clients. Still the masses do not access banks.

Competition is tough only because all the banks have similar products. There is no new business design and operating models. Every bank wants to give mortgage bank but there is no specialized mortgage bank. There is no SME corporate or agriculture bank. Many people say all the private banks look like CBE branches. And because all the banks have similar products it looks like there is a stiff competition.

Did the CBE stop providing loans for condo projects?

We are still providing the loan. The risk is low for CBE. Basically the loan shifts from the city administration to the housing beneficiaries. The loan defaults if the city fails to deliver the houses.",,,,,,,,,

TRI data are reported to EPA annually by facilities in certain industry sectors including federal facilities that manufacture process or otherwise use TRI-listed chemicals above certain quantities. The data include quantities of such chemicals that were released into the environment or otherwise managed as waste. Information collected through the TRI allows communities to learn how facilities in their area are managing listed chemicals. The data collected also help inform EPA’s efforts to better understand the listed substances.

“We will use every tool in our toolbox to protect our communities from PFAS pollution” said Assistant Administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention Michal Freedhoff. “Requiring companies to report on how these PFAS are being managed recycled or released is an important part of EPA’s comprehensive plan to fill critical data gaps for these chemicals and take meaningful action to safeguard communities from PFAS.”

The Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) provides the framework for adding additional PFAS to the TRI each year. For TRI Reporting Year 2022 (reporting forms due by July 1 2023) reporting is required for four additional PFAS.

Among other provisions section 7321(c) of the NDAA identifies certain regulatory activities that automatically add PFAS or classes of PFAS to the TRI beginning January 1 the following year and the agency’s finalization of a toxicity value is one of the triggering actions.

In April 2021 EPA finalized a toxicity value for perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) (Chemical Abstracts Service registry number (CASRN) 375-73-5) and potassium perfluorobutane sulfonate (CASRN 29420-49-3); therefore these substances have been added to TRI. PFBS-based compounds are replacement chemicals for PFOS a chemical that was voluntarily phased out by the primary U.S. manufacturer by 2002. PFBS has been identified in the environment and consumer products including surface water wastewater drinking water dust carpeting and carpet cleaners and floor wax.

EPA previously updated the Code of Federal Regulations with PFAS that were added to the TRI on January 1 2021 pursuant to section 7321(c) of the NDAA and their being regulated by an existing significant new use rule (SNUR) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (see 40 CFR 721.10536). EPA has since determined that one additional PFAS CASRN 65104-45-2 is designated as “active” on the TSCA Inventory and is covered by the SNUR. Therefore this substance has also been added to the TRI pursuant to the NDAA.

Additionally under NDAA section 7321(e) EPA must review CBI claims before adding any PFAS to the TRI list whose identity is subject to a claim of protection from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(a). EPA previously identified one PFAS CASRN 203743-03-7 for addition to the TRI list based on the NDAA’s provision to include certain PFAS upon the NDAA’s enactment (section 7321(b)(1)); however due to a confidential business information (CBI) claim related to its identity this PFAS was not included on the TRI list until EPA completed its review of the CBI claim. This PFAS was included in updates to the confidential status of chemicals on the TSCA Inventory published by EPA in October 2021 and thus was added to the TRI list due to the CBI declassification.

As of January 1 2022 facilities which are subject to reporting requirements for these chemicals should start tracking their activities involving these PFAS as required by Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. Reporting forms for these PFAS will be due to EPA by July 1 2023 for calendar year 2022 data.

EPA continues to act on Administrator Regan’s PFAS Strategic Roadmap announced in October 2021 a plan that delivers on the agency ’s mission to protect public health and the environment and answers the call for action on these persistent and dangerous chemicals. In addition to continuing to add PFAS to the TRI EPA also will soon announce a series of PFAS test orders that will require PFAS manufacturers to provide the agency with toxicity data and information on PFAS.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW1waW9ubmV3c3BhcGVycy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlX2M2ZjhiMTE2LTgwOGMtMTFlYy1hOGViLTA3Y2NkOTQ5ZjNjZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste Management wins Chino Hills trash contract | News | championnewspapers.com,"×

Department is the newest STARS award recipient. Mayor Shane McFarland recognized

Gossett Jan. 27 before the regular City Council meeting.

Gossett joined the City team as director of Solid Waste on Sept. 28 2020 after serving in the private sector for FedEx Freight and Republic Services. Recently when inclement weather closed Middle Point Landfill Jan. 6-7 Gossett and his department operated collection services on Saturday Jan. 8 to efficiently complete garbage service for the week.

The following STARS award nomination was submitted by Jennifer Smith an employee in Solid Waste:

“Russell since being hired as the director of Solid Waste has increased moral in our department. He has made a lot of positive changes. He exhibits fairness and stability with all employees. He doesn’t openly display favoritism toward anyone. He does not ask anything of us that he himself is not willing to do. He leads by example not by rule and do as I say. He has earned the respect of the department by this display. He treats us all as adults and expects us to act like it. He is honest and truthful. If we ask a question and he does not have an answer immediately he will tell you and will get the answer and get back to you regardless of the amount of time it takes to get the answer. He doesn’t just tell us something to satisfy us so that we will go away. He has integrity and expects the same from those of us he supervises. If has been a very difficult adjustment for some and for others it is the change we have been waiting and wanting. . . .He doesn’t say one thing to one employee and something different to another. He is the same with everyone including vendors other City departments’ employees and most importantly citizens.”

STARS stands for “Succeeding Through Attitudes Reflecting Service Excellence.” They’re examples of representing the City in a positive light exhibiting the core values and creating a better quality of life for citizens.

The STARS Service Excellence program is intended to recognize outstanding employees who embody the city’s standards for service excellence and exemplify the city’s core service values.

“BIGWU also notes with serious concern that many of the jobs and services done by the workers will now be outsourced to the Dominican Republic and this is tantamount to “job trafficking”. This action by Scotiabank will put these 149 workers on the breadline in the midst of a global pandemic and economic hardship.

“The families of these workers will also be adversely affected and there will be severe social dislocation by the unconscionable actions of this Canadian multinational bank” the union said in a statement.

Scotiabank said that the decision to send home the workers was ‘not taken lightly and we will ensure all employees are treated fairly and with respect as they transition employment”.

In a letter sent to staff Scotiabank said that it plans to close its collections department which would result in the retrenchment of all front line members of staff and support including managers.

It said that those departments would now be rerouted through Scotiabank’s offices in the Dominican Republic from May 31.

“As we work towards continuous improvement of client offerings and service standards we will continue to invest in automation leverage centres of excellence and size and scale throughout our global footprint. These advances will drive changes in our back-office support functions / centralised operations hubs. More specifically there will be changes at The Operations and Shared Services Company Ltd (OSSCL).

“Upcoming changes will result in the consolidation of certain support services and back end functions including the consolidation of a part of our Collections Unit into our Global Business Services Hub in the Dominican Republic – which also currently services our Canadian operation.

“Over the next few months OSSCL will also be impacted by the expiry of some operations functions that support the divested Eastern Caribbean territories” the bank added.

But in its statement the BIWU said that the action by Scotiabank in closing several of its branches will also cause hardship and inconvenience to its customers many of whom are senior citizens and pensioners “still grappling with the concept of this “digital transformation” being forced upon them when what they desire is simply personal and humane service in their senior years.”.

The union said that it is calling on the bank “to review this decision and stands ready to assist the affected workers and others in the bank who predictably will be targeted for similar treatment by the bank before year end”

It also called on Labour Minister Stephen Mc Clashie to “act now and intervene to avert this unjust action of the employer and to ensure that the full provisions of the relevant Labour legislation are complied with”.

On November 27 2018 the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) announced that it would sell its businesses in nine Caribbean markets including Guyana St. Maarten Anguilla Antigua and Barbuda Dominica Grenada St. Kitts and Nevis St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to the Trinidad-based Republic Financial Holdings Ltd. (RFHL).

One year later the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) announced that effective November1 2019 the Bank of Nova Scotia operations in Anguilla Dominica Grenada St. Lucia St Kitts and Nevis and St Vincent and the Grenadines would cease and the RBTT operations would commence in these countries.

The Scotiabank operations in Antigua and Barbuda were taken over by the Eastern Caribbean Amalgamated Bank (ECAB’s) last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcmVsaWVmd2ViLmludC9yZXBvcnQvdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWJvbGl2YXJpYW4tcmVwdWJsaWMvdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWhlYWx0aC1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktZmluYWwtcmVwb3J0LW1kcnZlMDA00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Venezuela: Health Emergency - Final Report (MDRVE004) - Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of),"A. SITUATION ANALYSIS

Description of the context

Venezuela continues to face a complex situation in which access to essential services especially health services remains critical. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 the Venezuelan health system has been overwhelmed focusing its limited resources on addressing the emergency. In this regard the impact of COVID-19 has increased concerns about the population’s access to essential health services. In addition the outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria measles and malaria remain latent in the country. Essential health care is still needed for the most vulnerable population to reduce the spread of diseases.

The frequent national power cuts entail an additional burden on the health system especially on the emergency services and medical equipment such as dialysis machines refrigeration and ventilators among others. These have also affected the water supply as it depends entirely on pumps that work with electricity. Moreover due to the shortage of petrol and diesel fuel water pumping and supplies at urban and rural levels have been affected; quality and quantity are inadequate due to the lack of treatment supplies. In this context it is common for communities to receive water only once a week which increases the risks faced by the most vulnerable populations. This situation was aggravated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also failures have been registered in the distribution of domestic gas in several states. Therefore many people use biomass and firewood for cooking despite the risk of respiratory diseases.

In March 2020 the Government of Venezuela established restrictions to contain the spread of COVID19. From June 2020 until October 2021 a 7x7 flexibility scheme has been in place (7 days of strict quarantine followed by 7 days of flexibility). As a result of the increase in COVID-19 cases and the restrictions the number of community activities had to be reduced or suspended depending on the incidence of cases at the local level."

Lisa Barlow exploded in a hot mic tirade against her fellow Real Housewives of Salt Lake City co-star Meredith Marks in this week’s episode and Andy Cohen had Marks on to dissect Barlow’s rant line by line. Here’s an abridged quote of the hell Barlow unleashed on Marks.

Meredith can go fuck herself. I’m done with her cause I’m not a fucking whore and I don’t cheat on my husband. Her and her dumb fucking family that poses. Why don’t you own a house? Wait you can’t. ‘Cause your husband changes jobs every five minutes… She’s a whore. She’s fucked half of New York! She can go fuck herself! Here you can have my mic back.

Marks tells Cohen (and a completely rapt Bridget Everett) that she suspects much of Barlow’s rage is projection. Meaning “Lisa’s calling me a whore because she’s really the one slutting it up at the ol’ slut house.” And that she accused Meredith of being fake because she’s always posting staged shots on Instagram. Meredith says she’s slept with less than 10 people that her husband changes jobs a lot because that’s the nature of his profession and that they are currently renting because they are empty nesters who haven’t settled on a new forever home yet. And according to Marks the whole tirade was prompted by someone telling Barlow that Meredith didn’t like Lisa’s house.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZG9sbHktcGFydG9uLWF3a3dhcmQtc3RyYW5nZS1yZWxhdGlvbnNoaXAtaGFsZi1icm90aGVyLmh0bWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dolly Parton Had an 'Awkward and Strange' Relationship With Her Half-Brother,"Dolly Parton went to school with her half-brother but he didn't know they were related. She explained what their relationship was like.

Dolly Parton grew up with a large family who she frequently welcomed into her world of performance. As it turns out however Parton’s family was more expansive than it initially seemed. She explained that her father had several children outside of his marriage. Parton said that her relationship with one of her half-brothers was slightly uncomfortable.

Dolly Parton | Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images

Dolly Parton was one of twelve children

Parton was the fourth of twelve children born to her mother Avie Lee Owens and father Lee Parton. Both parents were extremely busy with Lee working as a farmer and Avie Lee consistently pregnant and raising infants. Because of this the Parton children had to care for one another.

“Mom and Dad loved us but didn’t have time for all of us” Parton said per the book Smart Blonde: The Life of Dolly Parton by Stephen Miller. “We only got picked up when we were being nursed or to have our butts whipped.”

Avie Lee was primarily occupied with the youngest child so the older Parton children cared for their younger siblings.

“There were so many of us that we each older one had to take care of the others” Parton said on Home & Family. “Mom was just having one baby. There was only 18 months to two years difference in our ages. So as the kids started multiplying mom would say ‘Well this one’s going to be your baby.’”

She described her relationship with her half-brother as awkward

As a way to “blow off his own steam” as Parton’s sister Stella put it Lee Parton would often go to town to drink on the weekends. In town he sometimes met with other women.

“Daddy he often ran around and he had some children outside of us but he was a good father and a good husband” Parton told Interview Magazine. “He always came home. He was just a little wild and I can certainly understand that because I’m a combination of both of them. But he always loved Mama and always treated us good.”

According to Miller one of these children was a boy roughly Parton’s age and the two went to the same school. He reportedly had no idea that he was her half-brother.

“He had a thing for me he had this feeling for me” she explained.

While she found this “awkward and strange” Parton did not feel that it was her place to tell him they were related.

Dolly Parton reportedly wrote the song ‘Robert’ about her half-brother

Years later Parton wrote the song “Robert” about a similar situation. In it the narrator describes a rich man who is interested in her without knowing that they share the same father.

“Robert oh Robert if you only knew/ The same blood is flowing in both me and you/ That rich boy’s your father but he’s also mine/ And my mamma is the poor girl that he left behind.”

While the roles are reversed with the narrator living with the mother instead of the father it tells a similar story to Parton’s real life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZ2hhbmFmdW8uY29tL3doYXQtZG9lcy1qb2Utcm9nYW5zLXdpZmUtamVzc2ljYS1kaXR6ZWwtZG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What does Joe Rogan's wife Jessica Ditzel do?,"Joe Rogan is one of the top American podcasters Ultimate Fighting and Championship color commentator.

I recently had my first solo cruise experience with a 4-night sailing on Independence of the Seas and a 7-night sailing on Harmony of the Seas.

Before my cruises I was feeling nervous about what it would be like to go on a cruise alone.

While I have done travel days alone here and there I had never done a full vacation solo. In the end though I had a wonderful experience and came back with a few tips and tricks that can really enhance a solo cruise experience.

Initial Concerns

I am an extrovert and get a lot of energy from being around and experiencing things with other people. Feeling lonely was my main concern going into my solo cruises. Would I not talk to anyone for 7 days? Would I be doing everything alone? Will I dislike not having someone there with whom I could share my experience?

Another concern I had was with dining. I don’t normally eat alone at restaurants at home so I was not sure what my dining experience would be like onboard. Going into my cruises I planned to eat most meals at the buffet and spend my days in port or at sea exploring solo.

In the end my solo cruise experiences could not have been more different than I initially imagined. I ended the two cruises with new friends and memories made throughout the Caribbean. Most importantly though I learned a few key lessons that may help alleviate a few concerns if you are planning a solo cruise vacation.

Meeting other passengers is easy

As soon as I boarded Independence of the Seas for my first solo cruise I quickly realized that you are never truly alone on a cruise ship. There are thousands of passengers and crew members all around you so it’s never too hard to strike up a conversation.

During my time on Independence of the Seas I would go to events onboard that skewed more social such as trivia and also chat with the bartenders and crew throughout the ship.

After my cruise on Independence I felt extra confident as a solo cruiser for my next sailing on Harmony of the Seas. My solo cruise on Harmony ended up not being very “solo” at all!

As soon as I got onboard I met two guests Zach and Collin at the embarkation day lunch with The Key. We ended up spending a lot of time together throughout the cruise whether at the Windjammer Aquatheater or Solarium.

As the week went on we slowly introduced more people into our “cruise squad”. One place that proved to be a fantastic social environment onboard were the hot tubs! Hanging out in the hot tub always led to interesting conversations with fellow passengers several of which I connected with throughout the rest of the cruise.

By the end of the week I had a group of five other passengers to hang out with onboard. From evenings in the Promenade to sunny afternoons on the pool deck it was a blast. I certainly did not expect to meet such a fun group of people so easily as a solo cruiser.

On the last night we shared a dinner at Jamie’s Italian and it was a wonderful way to close out a “solo” cruise experience that ended up being one of my most social cruises yet.

Dining “alone” can be fun!

Dining is one of the biggest concerns for solo cruisers but on my cruise I learned that dining alone does not have to seem so intimidating. I found that if I was eating alone crew members would often stop by my table to get to know me. One morning at breakfast in the Main Dining Room I was seated at a table next to another solo cruiser and we ended up chatting for around an hour! I rarely had a completely “solo” meal.

The best decision I made though was booking dinner at Izumi Hibachi on Independence of the Seas. Izumi Hibachi tables seat eight people. If your group is not a party of 8 multiple parties will be seated together at the same table.

My hibachi table had four separate parties and as usual the hibachi experience created an environment of conversation and laughter with plenty of mouth-watering food. I think Izumi Hibachi is the best choice for a solo cruiser looking to enjoy a more social dining experience onboard.

Time in port is really flexible when you’re solo

I thoroughly enjoyed my solo days in port too. One benefit of cruising solo is that you can choose to do whatever you want while in port. You don’t have to plan around anyone else’s preferences interests and schedule.

I spent my days solo exploring Nassau cycling around St. Maarten and chilling out at Perfect Day at CocoCay and had an amazing time even if I did not share the experience with anyone else.

I also learned that booking excursions can also be an easy way to mingle with fellow passengers. In St. Thomas I reserved the Discover Scuba excursion which took ten guests to an island off the coast of St. Thomas to learn the basics of scuba diving. The exploratory nature of the excursion fostered a social environment for everyone in the group leading to a fun afternoon of conversation diving and snorkeling.

I spent my days relaxing solo at Perfect Day at CocoCay. If you’re looking to meet guests at Cococay though I’d say the best spot to meet people there is Oasis Lagoon. This always turns into a big party in the afternoon and can be a fun way to mingle with other guests (or just people watch as the party gets wild!).

Post-cruise thoughts

Cruising solo is not nearly as “scary” as I thought it would be and I actually enjoyed the independence and freedom it gave me to plan my cruise vacation. As an extrovert I did not feel lonely once although I did enjoy having an internet package so I could still chat with friends and family back home.

Do I prefer cruising solo or with friends and family? I think I still prefer to cruise with friends or family because a huge part of traveling for me is making memories with those close to me. I feel that some things in life whether discovering a new island or enjoying a fancy dinner are better shared with friends and family.

However I would definitely cruise solo again. Making friends onboard proved to be extremely easy and having a group to hang out with certainly enhanced my experience.

It’s also nice though that if I did not want to be social I could have stayed to myself. There is no requirement to go on a solo cruise with the intention of making new friends or always chatting with other guests and crew. I however found the way that works best for me and I am already looking forward to my next solo cruise.

Royal Caribbean is set to launch the world's largest cruise ship in March. The biggest name in the cruise industry took delivery of the world's largest ship that will see the record-breaking vessel take set sail on cruises around both the Caribbean and Europe later this year. The ship aptly named Wonder of the Seas had been under construction in France since April 2019.

This latest development comes at a time when cruise enthusiasts have been crying out for something to celebrate following a number of setbacks and cancellations that have afflicted the beleaguered cruise industry over the past few weeks. Here's a closer look at the Wonder of the Seas including where it will be heading first and what guests can look forward to experiencing on board.

Wonder of the Seas – Information For Travelers

Royal Caribbean aren't strangers to big boats having previously held the record with their 228081 gross registered tonne (grt) ship Symphony of the Seas – but their latest shop Wonder of the Seas is set to take things to another level. Weighing in at a staggering 236857 grt and 1118 feet in length the boat is set to take the crown from its sister ship when it gets out onto the open seas for its premiere voyages in just a few weeks time.

Wonder of the Seas will launch with passengers for the first time on March 4th. From Fort Lauderdale in Florida the ship will leave for both the Eastern and Western Caribbean on 7-night cruises. Not only will Wonder of the Seas be calling at Caribbean cruising favorites Nassau Roatan and San Juan it will also be heading the cruise line's private island destination Perfect Day at CocoCay – the perfect way to start it's life on the water.

Following this Wonder will move on to both Barcelona and Rome in May of this year from which it will depart on summer cruises around the Mediterranean. These 7 night offerings will see Wonder of the Seas take in some of the Mediterranean's most picturesque cruise destinations such as Naples and Florence in Italy Palma de Mallorca in Spain and Provence in France.

After it's journeys around the Mediterranean Wonder of the Seas will return to North America in November. From Port Canaveral in Florida Wonder of the Seas will be taking passengers to some much-needed warm weather destinations around the Caribbean once more with destinations ranging from Perfect Day at CocoCay and Philipsburg St. Maarten to Charlotte Amalie St. Thomas; and Cozumel Mexico.

However it's not just the destinations that passengers aboard Wonder of the Seas have to get excited about but the ship itself. The state of the art cruise ship will feature eight distinct neighborhoods on board for passengers to explore as well as a cantilevered pool bar activities such as slides and arcades plus the typical high quality food and drink establishments that passengers have come to expect from Royal Caribbean.

Those missing terra firma can take advantage of Central Park the neighborhood filled with real plants or choose to engage in either a luxury spa treatment or a spot of retail therapy on board. Wonder of the Seas is capable of holding 6988 guests in total along with 2300 crew and has 18 decks and 2867 state rooms on board.

Talking up the new ship Jason Liberty president and CEO of the Royal Caribbean Group said:

“Wonder of the Seas will energize cruising in a bolder and bigger way. Adding this ship to our already best-in-class fleet elevates the company in continuing to lead the industry with new features and innovation. This is one more way that we’re delivering world-class and memorable vacations responsibly to guests around the world.”

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so."

However speaking at Calcalist’s Innovation Week conference its Strategic Advisor EMEA Bar Israeli is ready to set the record straight about what the company can do to help the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Startup Nation.

“Salesforce is a massive technology platform however it is also a platform for success. When entrepreneurs join they get an integrated offering that includes the same platform that Salesforces uses for its own development and growth therefore they can grow at the same rate” Israeli explained. One of the ways entrepreneurs can benefit from Salesforce is through its Business Builder Program designed for early-stage B2B innovators.

She continued: “The revenue share model that we are offering the entrepreneur actually helps them within a few days develop their prototype faster and for free and with the resources we provide they can accelerate learning and more than that they can focus on business objectives.” She cited OwnBackup and Xotigo as some success stories.

This round of funding was led by New York-based global venture capital and private equity firm Insight Partners along with participation from existing investors True Ventures and MoreVC.

Vanti Analytics was founded by Smadar David and Nir Osiroff in 2019. David and Osiroff both have engineering backgrounds and come from manufacturing organizations giving them a deep understanding of AI challenges that can arise for manufacturers.

60% of manufacturing companies that adopt AI are seeing cost reductions of more than 10% and revenue increases that can exceed 10%"" according to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI.

However many companies struggle to implement AI at scale because they don't have the ""right practices to sustain models in dynamic production environments as well as explainability for those models."" An employee of Seagate Technology is enlarged by a magnifying glass as she concentrates on assembling hard disk drives in a ''clean room'' at one of their Singapore plants May 5. (credit: REUTERS)

Vanti's AI platform ""provides a first of its kind end-to-end offering overseeing the entire AI lifecycle – from raw data to development and maintenance of models.""

The company provides automated machine-learning products created to help manufacturers without data science backgrounds enable production line optimization while simultaneously maintaining high-quality standards.

Vanti's technology has been adopted by major manufacturers such as Seagate and Flex and they plan to use the new funding to ""fuel growth expand globally and invest in the company’s next generation of AI technology"".

La empresa Sempra Energy propietaria del Parque Eólico Energía Sierra Juárez donó más de 140 mil pesos en equipos para el combate de incendios a la brigada forestal de voluntarios del ejido Jacumé ya que en el área sólo en el 2020 se perdieron más de 80 mil hectáreas de bosque por el fuego. Con este equipo se mitigarán los siniestros que salen de control por la falta de equipo adecuado para los brigadistas lo que periódicamente representa pérdidas económicas la afectación de la flora y fauna local así como la contaminación del aire y la propagación del fuego.

El representante de la Comisión Nacional Forestal (Conafor) Jesús Alfredo Espinoza Méndez dio la bienvenida a esta inversión que viene a cerrar la pinza después del convenio firmado entre ejido y gobierno federal para la formación de una brigada especial en La Rumorosa que será la primer respondiente en caso de cualquier siniestro.

Desde el 16 de enero pasado y hasta el 15 de junio en forma conjunta operarán dos brigadas de Conafor en todo el municipio de Tecate con base en esa ciudad para atender emergencias anunció el funcionario federal.

Durante el evento Mario López Gerente de Asuntos Externos de Sempra Infraestructura entregó el equipo al presidente del Comisariado Ejidal de Jacumé Felícitas Cortez López quien destacó la importancia de contar con este equipo que no es solo para la protección de la flora y fauna endémica de la zona sino de la salud e integridad de los voluntarios

Step-by-step guide,"Advertisement

Snapchat is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. Last year the platform crosses the milestone of 300 million daily active users who are sending millions of photographs or short videos (called Snap) to each other on the application. Another very popular feature of the application is Snapstreaks. The users who regularly Snap each other form a Snapstreak which reflects as a number alongside the user’s name on the home screen.

However the Snapstreak can go away if the users forget to send a Snap for 24 hours. For users who have sent photographs regularly to their friends for hundreds of days losing the Snapstreak can be very frustrating. Thankfully users can get their lost Snapstreaks back. Apparently Snapchat allows users to report to the team if they are facing any issue with the application. Using the feature Snapchat users can report about the lost Snapstreak and they might get it back within 24 hours. While this method does not guarantee the restoring of Snapstreak it is the best shot a user has.

How to get back Snapstreak on Snapchat?

Open Snapchat

Click on your avatar on the top left corner of the screen

In the menu that opens click on the top right corner of the screen to open Settings

Scroll down to locate the Support section can tap on “I need help”

In the support page that opens tap on “Snapstreaks”

Locate the hyperlink that reads “If you feel there was an error please let us know” and tap on it

In the section that opens select “I’ve lost my Snapstreak”

Thereafter Snapchat will open a form that requires basic detail like username email address mobile number device (on which Snapchat is installed) friend’s username and more

Fill out all the details correctly and stay extra cautious while filling out the spaces for user names

In the question that asks “Did you see the (hour-glass) icon?” – answer “No”

After filling out the form click on the send button that appears below it

To be on the safer side ask the friend with whom you had a Snapstreak to report as well

Wait for a period of 24 hours to check if the streak has been restored",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDQ1NTA1My9UYW1hcmEtRWNjbGVzdG9uZS1zaGFyZXMtaGVhcnR3YXJtaW5nLXRocm93YmFjay1zbmFwLXNpc3Rlci1QZXRyYS5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDQ1NTA1My9hbXAvVGFtYXJhLUVjY2xlc3RvbmUtc2hhcmVzLWhlYXJ0d2FybWluZy10aHJvd2JhY2stc25hcC1zaXN0ZXItUGV0cmEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tamara Ecclestone shares heartwarming throwback snap of her and sister Petra,"Tamara Ecclestone shared a sweet throwback snap of her and her younger sister Petra 33 on Saturday.

YE GOT TO BE KIDDING Piers Morgan slams Kanye West as ‘cringe’ after tongue kiss snap with girlfriend Julia Fox

PIERS Morgan branded Kanye West and new girlfriend Julia Fox ""cringe"" after they were snapped tongue kissing at Paris Fashion Week.

The smitten couple have been inseparable in recent weeks with a series of loved-up displays and celebrity parties.

These two are so cringe. 🤮 pic.twitter.com/qxt0mDe3He — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 29 2022

2 Piers Morgan wasn't a fan of Kanye West and Julia Fox's public snog

2 The couple are in Paris for the city's Fashion Week

But their latest amorous snog proved too much for Piers and made him feel nauseous.

Sharing the kiss snap on Twitter he added: ""These two are so cringe. [vomit emoji]""

It came after Piers slammed food critic Jay Rayner for being a ""pompous a**e"" on the platform.

High-profile couple Kanye and Julia were in a gothic mood in the French capital with the 44-year-old wearing spooky contact lenses and lots of black leather.

While actress Julia 31 went heavy on the black eye makeup and wore a red PVC dress with thigh-high split huge silver boots and matching gloves.

Uncut Gems actress Julia is said to be a fan of Kanye's latest track Eazy despite him hitting out at ex Kim Kardashian and her new man Pete Davidson.

The diss track in which Kanye refers to Julia as a ""bad b***h"" sees the controversial artist take aim at Kim's mothering skills as well as stating he'll beat comedian Pete's ""ass"".

Kanye was recently left fuming when Kim kissed Pete in front of him while filming SNL.

While he still seems hung up on his ex Ye spared no expense on his new girlfriend in the short time they've been together. He showered her with new clothes on their second date and it worked a charm.

Mum-of-one Julia told Interview Magazine: ""For someone like me who's such a control freak and always so used to taking care of myself to just let go and be taken care of is foreign at this point in life.

""I've been the primary caretaker of everyone for so long so it's a new sensation but honestly I think I deserve it.""

Kim filed for divorce from Kanye in February 2021 after a string of public outbursts and bizarre behaviour.

Paul R. Dixon ’83

As a postdoctoral researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico Paul Dixon delved into a range of projects in physical chemistry nuclear chemistry and nuclear geochemistry. Dixon’s wide-ranging expertise prompted LANL to invite him to lead the geochemistry research for and ultimately their entire contribution to the ambitious vision for a permanent nuclear waste storage facility for the United States at Yucca Mountain Nevada.

The Yucca Mountain project was intended to address the nation’s growing stockpile of nuclear waste. Dixon and his colleagues were tasked with designing a leak-proof disaster-proof storage facility that would contain tons of dangerous materials for at least 25000 years. As the LANL team program manager Dixon oversaw an annual $12-million budget devoted to creating and studying geological and geochemical tests that Los Alamos was conducting. Under two different Department of Energy (DOE) contractors Dixon was the deputy science manager for the Yucca Mountain project and managed an annual budget of approximately $85 million and support from seven national laboratories twelve subcontractors and four universities. He also briefed congressional committees and officials from four states. During the final year Dixon worked on the Yucca Mountain project he also became the technical manager of the post-closure criticality group.

Since the federal government’s abandonment of the Yucca Mountain project Dixon has applied his unparalleled understanding of hazardous waste management to a career involving safe and cost-effective cleanup of environmental contamination at former DOE weapons production sites.

2013 Distinguished Alumni Awards Recipients

Douglas R. Armstrong ’88

At the age of 13 Doug Armstrong had an unpaid job filing x-rays at Albion Community Hospital because he was too young to join the hospital’s “red vest” volunteers. Since then he has continued to follow his passions for medicine and service saving and enriching the lives of thousands of seriously ill people.

Armstrong became a licensed emergency medical technician (EMT) even before he graduated from Albion High School and during his student days at Albion College he volunteered for the Albion Area Ambulance Service. While earning his bachelor’s degree in nursing at Wayne State University he worked for the University of Michigan as a transplant organ perfusionist flying with surgical teams to collect and transport organs. He helped initiate U-M’s clinical transplant research program and served as the assistant director of transplant clinical research and clinical trials manager a position he held for 13 years.

As a volunteer during this time Armstrong helped create Camp Michitanki (Michigan Transplant Kids) but quickly realized that complete success of such a program required a custom-designed facility. In 2007 he left transplant research to found and serve as chief executive officer for North Star Reach a nonprofit now affiliated with Paul Newman’s SeriousFun Children’s Network. Next year thanks to his leadership and energetic fundraising North Star Reach will begin construction of a 105-acre camp near Pinckney for campers ages 7-15 with chronic and life-threatening health challenges.

Formerly the assistant fire chief for Scio Township Fire Department and a firefighter/paramedic with the Dexter Area Fire Department he has been honored with a Police and Firefighters Insurance Association Heroes Hall of Fame Award and Washtenaw Area Mutual Aid Association Life Saving Award.

He is the son of Roberta Armstrong and Robert Armstrong professor emeritus of chemistry. Armstrong and his wife Joan Marie live in Dexter Michigan with their son Jackson Douglas.

Martin H. Nesbitt ’85

He may have grown up in Ohio but Marty Nesbitt is a true Chicagoan. Beyond meeting his wife and befriending a future U.S. president there Nesbitt has distinguished himself as both a professional success and an engaged community servant in the Windy City.

Nesbitt moved to Chicago as a General Motors Fellow to complete an M.B.A. at the University of Chicago. After earning his degree he joined the real estate investment company LaSalle Partners where he became an equity vice president within five years.

At LaSalle Nesbitt recognized the resilience of parking as a real estate asset class even during tough economic cycles and the investment opportunities associated with the way the parking industry was structured. This insight led Nesbitt to develop The Parking Spot an airport parking company which today has nearly million in annual revenue and 2000 employees. Earlier this year Nesbitt launched a new private equity firm The Vistria Group which focuses on investing in middle market companies that operate at the nexus of the public and private sectors in the education health care and financial services industries.

A friend of Barack Obama for nearly 20 years Nesbitt served as finance chair for Obama’s Congressional race and served on the Finance Committee for his U.S. Senate campaign before becoming treasurer of Obama’s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. These presidential campaigns birthed innovative Web-based efforts that combined with traditional fundraising tactics to break all previous fundraising and citizen-engagement records. Ultimately they helped elect Nesbitt’s close friend and basketball buddy the first African-American president of the United States.

Despite the professional and political demands on his time Nesbitt has been devoted to community service. Mayor Richard M. Daley appointed him to the board of the Chicago Housing Authority where he eventually served as chair. Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed him to an advisory committee weighing the privatization of Midway Airport. Nesbitt is a current trustee of Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art. He also serves on two corporate boards Jones Lang LaSalle and Norfolk Southern Corporation.

At Albion Nesbitt served as co-captain of the Briton basketball team and was also a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity Mortar Board Omicron Delta Kappa and the Professional Management Program. In 2009 he delivered the Stoffer Lecture at Albion’s Opening Convocation and was awarded an honorary doctorate at that time.

2012 Distinguished Alumni Awards Recipients

Josh A. Cassada ’95

The sky’s the limit for all Albion alumni but in Josh Cassada’s case that might not be quite high enough. He has spent much of the past decade flying combat and rescue missions training pilots and testing out new wings for the U.S. Navy.

Then two years ago at the ripe old age of 37 Cassada began helping the Navy purchase planes directing nearly $28 billion in contracts with Boeing. In this role he is responsible for overseeing production of the P-8A (anti-submarine) and KC-46 (refueling) aircraft airborne early warning and control systems and unmanned aerial vehicles.

April DuVal ’65

This past July April DuVal retired as executive director of the Jefferson County Kentucky Council on Developmental Disabilities (CDD). During her 43-year tenure there April provided leadership for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act helped develop educational vocational and residential programs for persons with intellectual disabilities and established the Parent Outreach and Citizen Advocacy programs in Louisville.

Even more admirably while April helped change society’s view and treatment of the developmentally disabled she served hundreds of clients with individual personal care. “Almost every parent who is active in the CDD could tell a story about how April personally helped them through a trying time” says Natalie Semaria a “CCD parent” for nearly 40 years. Semaria further notes that April has been “the guardian and/or payee for several disabled adults who have no one else to stand up for them. She personally accompanied me to Guardian Court understanding that it was a difficult step for me. April has retired from her leadership role but I know that she will never “retire” from caring for disabled people and acting as an advocate.

DuVal was among the first in her field to recognize the potential for computers to transform learning and employment for people with disabilities. She won grants from Apple to establish an enabling technology center and is a past president of the National Alliance of Technology Access. She has taught classes for the School of Social Work at Spalding University. She is also a past president of the Kentucky Association on Mental Retardation.

April has received numerous awards including the University of Louisville Outstanding Social Work Field Supervisor the Louisville Courier Journal Phenomenal Woman Award and the Kentucky Colonel Award presented by Governor John Y. Brown. She has been honored officially by the mayor of Louisville the 3rd Kentucky Congressional District the Kentucky House of Representatives and the Kentucky Senate.

Childhood friend and Albion classmate Sharon Thorne Vydick ’65 notes that April was also their sixth-grade class president and organizer of their 50-year high school reunion. “She’s been my friend for life” said Vydick who notes that she and classmate Teresa Trostmiller ’65 regularly enjoy being with their friend. “April is very driven and that’s gotten her where she is. She is a friendly happy smiley person and that’s why everyone loves her.”

“April and I benefitted from the Kresges and Putnams the people who love Albion and support it in very tangible ways” says April’s sister Marcia Lile ’67. “It’s great that Albion acknowledges people like April who never made a lot of money but who also loved Albion and were also impacted in the same way. When we were students in the 1960s Albion brought us speakers like Martin Luther King Jr. who encouraged us to act in daring ways. Those were inspiring times and April’s life is a response to that.”

After graduating Phi Beta Kapp with honors from Albion April earned her MSW from the University of Michgian. In 1994 she was inducted into Albion’s Athletic Hall of Fame for her prowess on the field hockey team. She has two children and six grandchildren and lives in Louisville.

Lori Latowski Grover ’85

Richard B. Jones ’71

For 24 of his 38 years in education Richard Jones was employed as a teacher coach and principal at North Farmington High School in suburban Detroit—but what he did there reached far beyond any of those job expectations. An innovative and out-of-the-box thinker Jones implemented programs that energized and inspired not only his own students and teachers but the Farmington community and other educators across the country. Upon his retirement in 2011 North Farmington High School’s main building was renamed the Richard B. Jones Academic Center. The school’s athletic campus is also named in his honor.

Jones’ legacy includes his implementation of school year “themes” that involved students teachers parents and the community in exploration of social justice issues through numerous interdisciplinary activities. Environmentalism and sustainability civil rights and the revitalization of Detroit were among the topics studied with the goal of moving the students “from awareness to activism.” During the school’s yearlong examination of genocide Jones was co-recipient of the Anne Frank Center USA’s Spirit of Anne Frank Outstanding Educator Award. Jones and North Farmington joined forces with a high school in Danbury Connecticut together raising over $135000 to build “Promise School” in Sudan as an activism project for the genocide study.

Not surprisingly Jones has earned many awards for excellence including four Teacher-of-the-Year honors; he is also a recipient of the Great Seal of Michigan for his school’s efforts to pass a state divestiture bill regarding Sudan. He is Michigan’s 2008-09 High School Principal of the Year. Jones has been on the board of the Michigan Chapter of the National Football Foundation since 1995 and since 2004 has traveled to Mali in West Africa three times as a member of a medical team.

A Detroit native Jones spent 14 years as a teacher and coach in Bay County Florida before moving to Farmington Hills. He earned a master’s degree in movement science and sports psychology from Florida State University where he also studied school administration.

As a student at Albion Jones played varsity baseball was a member of Alpha Tau Omega and founded Albion’s chapter of Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

He and his wife Kathy are the parents of Keely and Lauren and live in Farmington Hills.

Duane Nelles ’66

Like many good economics and mathematics students Duane Nelles was attracted to the world of accounting where he quickly built a very successful career. So it may have surprised some when he turned to venture capitalism but the move proved to be beneficial both for Nelles and the little startup that caught his eye. Partially thanks to his investment and his presence on its board for nearly a quarter century the “little startup” Qualcomm has become a global leader in telecommunications supporting most wireless technologies including cell phones with all their numerous applications.

Nelles’s accounting career began in 1968 in the Detroit office of what was then Coopers & Lybrand (now PricewaterhouseCoopers). After just four years he opened Coopers & Lybrand’s San Diego office and became a partner in 1974. Over the next 14 years Nelles worked with the firm’s California-based clients while directing several administrative operations in the San Diego office.

In 1988 Nelles left public accounting to become president of a private venture capital firm in La Jolla. In that role he made many venture capital investments including Qualcomm now one of the largest companies in the world. He had further success in venture capital having served on numerous boards of directors including Price/Costco Wescorp and WFSI Financial. In addition to his position on Qualcomm’s board he is currently a board member for American Assets Trust (a NYSE-listed real estate investment trust). Over the years Nelles has served on many boards of not- for-profit organizations chairing the Salvation Army board in San Diego.

Despite the distance between San Diego and southern Michigan Nelles continues to have an active interest in Albion College. He has underwritten several alumni events in the southern California region and is an informal adviser to President Donna Randall and a leading donor to the President’s Discretionary Fund. In spring 2010 Nelles and his wife Gail returned to Albion where he divided his time between executive planning sessions and meetings with Gerstacker Institute students.

Nelles received an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan. He and Gail live in La Jolla California and Sun Valley Idaho and have two sons and four grandchildren.

2011 Distinguished Alumni Awards Recipients

William H. Dobbins ’74

Bill Dobbins loves Albion. Simply stated yet running incredibly deep there truly is no better way to describe the feeling he has for his hometown and alma mater.

A premedical student who played football basketball and baseball (and was part of the 1971 Athletic Hall of Fame baseball team) Dobbins gained admission to the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine after just three years at Albion. His medical training completed he began practicing in Marshall with his brother James Dobbins ’69. Younger brother Thomas Dobbins ’79 later joined the family medical practice that continues to serve patients today in Marshall and Albion. For a quarter-century Dr. Bill’s care and compassion for his patients were well known throughout the community–and beyond as he regularly made trips to Jackson to administer care to incarcerated individuals.

Throughout those 25 years Dobbins helped a number of Albion premedical students gain firsthand knowledge of the practice of medicine–which sometimes included picking them up at their dorms for a late-night baby delivery at the hospital. Those students are practicing physicians and physician assistants today.

In 2003 Dr. Bill changed gears taking a leadership role in the family business. Since his father Richard started Caster Concepts in 1986 Dobbins had helped grow the business and handle the financials. But becoming president and CEO meant going back to school: he received his Executive M.B.A. from the University of Michigan in 2004.

While Dobbins has successfully expanded Caster Concepts into new technologically focused areas receiving Manufacturer of the Year Awards in Jackson and Albion he has continued to give back to the community and Albion College. In 2004 he initiated the Swingin’ at the Shell summer concert series. His other community efforts include the Victory for Kids playground project and the Manufacturing Education Fund at the Albion Community Foundation. His close ties to the College’s Gerstacker Institute mean that Albion students will often be found hard at work as Caster Concepts interns.

In his leisure time Dobbins enjoys golf cycling and collecting amberina art glass. He and his wife Karen Knudson Dobbins ’74 have three children: Andrew Emily ’03 and Caroline ’12.

Bill Dobbins continues to live in the place that he loves–Albion Michigan.

Deborah Wyatt Fellows ’78

Deb Fellows promptly began contemplating the life of a writer upon graduating from Albion with Phi Beta Kappa honors and majors in English and sociology. After many months of traveling she found a magazine job in the big city … working on such inspiring titles as Industrial Waste and Water and Sewage Works.

After two years in Chicago’s trade publishing scene she moved to Northern Michigan to figure out how to wed her now-true passion for magazines with her desire to live in the beautiful northern reaches of the Great Lakes State. Not long afterward–in June 1981–with a pledged $20000 Fellows at the age of 24 launched Traverse Northern Michigan’s Magazine. From day one its mission was to share stories that celebrate and protect the natural resources small communities and unique lifestyle of Northern Michigan.

Today Fellows’ Traverse City-based company MyNorth Media employs 26 people. Thirty years after its first issue Traverse has a circulation of 30000. It has won Magazine of the Year honors from the International Regional Magazine Association as well as First Place General Excellence awards from the City and Regional Magazine Association. Traverse is also the flagship of a group of eight magazines that includes Northern Home & Cottage. There’s a book division too: published titles include Fellows’ own Reflections of a Life Up North The Cottage Cookbook and others.

Three years ago MyNorth Media launched MyNorth.com; in 2010 the Web site received nearly a half-million visitors. Earlier this year MyNorth Media was chosen as part of Folio magazine’s Folio 40 for its innovative and successful use of multimedia.

Fellows has led national webinars for Folio and she speaks at conferences around the country on such topics as blending new and traditional media. A member of Alpha Chi Omega who wrote for The Pleiad Fellows has never forgotten Albion–regularly hiring students as interns. She’s a former board member of the Leelanau Conservancy and also belongs to the smart growth-focused Elm Street Writers Guild.

Deb is married to psychiatrist Neal Fellows; they live on the shores of Lake Leelanau in Leelanau County and have four children: sons Ben Peter and Austin and daughter Olivia.

Kathryn Koegel ’78

With an unrelenting focus on other individuals as well as the community at large Kathryn Koegel continues to make an impact on the lives of many Flint Michigan residents.

She received her bachelor’s degree from Albion in 1978 and immediately became a financial assistant at her family’s company Koegel Meats which by then was already a Michigan institution having been launched by her grandfather Albert in 1916. It wasn’t her first job at the place that was already a second home of sorts: during the summer months of her Albion career she gained experience in the packaging department.

It wasn’t long before she found her true niche with the company as its No. 1 people person. Today as vice president she oversees operations which includes a particular focus on employee relations. Over the course of three decades she has also led efforts in consumer relations and community outreach executing projects on behalf of the company. Koegel’s day-to-day leadership has kept the company thriving to the tune of 250000 pounds of frankfurters and lunch meats produced and distributed every week.

Kathryn Koegel’s commitment to Flint extends well outside the factory. She is an active supporter of both the Flint Institute of Music and the Flint Institute of Arts and has served in leadership roles with the Junior League of Flint the Genesee County Historical Society and the McLaren Regional Medical Center Foundation. Koegel also played a key role in building and managing Penny Whistle Place a beloved children’s playground.

The YWCA of Flint recognized Koegel’s efforts by presenting her its Women of Achievement award.

In the time she does set aside for herself Koegel enjoys travel reading sewing and skiing. She resides in Flint Michigan.

John C. Koegel ’85

Koegel. It’s a household name in Michigan especially during summer evenings around the grill. John Koegel and his sister Kathryn Koegel ’78 are keeping it that way as third-generation leaders at Koegel Meats.

Fresh out of Albion with an economics and management degree John Koegel started working on special projects for the 95-year-old family-run Flint company started by his German-born grandfather Albert. A major assignment for the recent graduate involved setting up bar coding and scanning for inventory purposes. Before long Koegel rose into a sales manager position and in 1994 became the company’s president taking over for his father Albert Jr.

From bockwurst to Whole-E-Smokes Koegel’s nearly 60 products today account for over $28 million in annual sales at 1200-plus locations in Michigan Ohio and Indiana. The Flint factory employs 115 people. And while business practices have evolved over the course of a century Koegel has not touched the company’s commitment to delivering to individual stores thereby ensuring a fresher product.

Before settling into the family business Koegel made sure not to just settle during his time at Albion. A member of the Professional Management Program (now the Gerstacker Institute for Business and Management) he attained Albion College Fellow distinction and graduated magna cum laude. He also laced up his skates as a member of Albion’s club-level ice hockey team. Today Koegel’s free time is less grounded–he’s a private pilot and owns his own plane. He’s not always whizzing about though; he also finds enjoyment in calmer activities such as fly fishing and playing the guitar.

Koegel serves as vice president and board member of Sunset Hills Cemetery in Flint and is also a leading trustee for the city’s First Presbyterian Church. He has a particular love for the Tall Pine Council’s Boy Scouts of America. His active involvement with Scouting has included time as a den leader and on the executive board and he has received the Silver Beaver Award for his distinguished service to youth.

Along with John the Koegel household includes his wife Lisa and their four children: Katlyn Chloe Carson and Cameron. They live in Flint Michigan.

Joel K. Manby ’81

A natural: That’s an accurate phrase to describe Joel Manby. A brilliant mind and a strong business sense–atop an even stronger foundation of family and faith–have carried him to many successes in life. And more than a decade in a CEO’s corner office has done nothing to dull those qualities.

Born and raised in Battle Creek Manby went on to shine 25 miles to the east at Albion College: class valedictorian; a Rhodes Scholar finalist; Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Nu fraternity; an All-MIAA selection and member of Albion Athletic Hall of Fame teams in football and baseball; and an NCAA Postgraduate Scholar (one of only four in Division III in 1981).

Manby went to work at General Motors and two years later he was in Harvard’s M.B.A. program on a GM scholarship. Upon completion in 1985 he was back at GM helping to launch the Saturn brand. After seven years with Saturn and a two-year term with GM’s International Division he was promoted to CEO of Saab Automobile USA. After a brief dot-com calling to start the 21st century he has been on a nearly 10-year ride as president and CEO of Herschend Family Entertainment the largest family-owned theme park corporation with 10000 employees and 26 properties in 10 states.

Beyond his career commitments Manby maintains an unwavering devotion to his family as well as his Christian faith. He serves as board chairman of reThink a nonprofit dedicated to values education. Other volunteer work includes the Salvation Army’s National Advisory Board; he is also a former trustee of Albion College.

In short Manby is not your everyday boss. Millions saw that for themselves when CBS featured him on an episode of Undercover Boss in spring 2010. While learning the ropes of several customer-service jobs incognito he got to know several of his employees as well as some of their obstacles in life. By show’s end he was able to make a difference for each of them–something that has always come naturally to Joel Manby.

He and his wife Marki are the parents of four daughters: Lauryn Erin Jesse and Anna. They live in Alpharetta Georgia.

David C. Sennema ’56

Grand Rapids native David Sennema came to Albion nearly 60 years ago with a gifted singing voice and an eagerness to participate. Naturally he joined the College choir and sang in the Sigma Nu fraternity’s quartet. He graduated from the College with a deep appreciation for the arts and an amazing capacity not only to achieve but to create.

Drafted into the Army one year after graduation and stationed in Fort Jackson South Carolina he concluded that the Palmetto State was the place he would eventually make his mark. In 1964 he became the first full-time executive director of the Columbia Music Festival Association where he helped to start the South Carolina Philharmonic. And the hits kept coming: in 1967 the first executive director of the South Carolina Arts Commission; in 1970 a move to the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington D.C. to help lead state arts grants; in 1973 a stop in Springfield Illinois to create a master’s program in arts administration at Sangamon State University.

He saved arguably his best success for his return to South Carolina in 1976 when he became director of the state’s Museum Commission. There was one thing missing however: a museum. Starting with a staff of four and virtually no collections let alone a building Sennema over more than a decade of effort led the way in creating a state museum of history natural history and science and technology as well as art. The South Carolina State Museum opened in 1988 in a historic mill building in downtown Columbia.

In the 1980s Sennema launched his own arts management consulting firm. Now retired he has put his magical voice to paper as well–to date he has written 25 short stories and a one-act play.

Twenty-five years ago South Carolina awarded its highest citizen honor the Order of the Palmetto to David Sennema. It’s wholly appropriate that Albion College act similarly through this Distinguished Alumni Award.

In 2006 Sennema received the Elizabeth O’Neill Verner Lifetime Achievement in the Arts Award. Presented by the South Carolina legislature the award honors a South Carolinian who has demonstrated exceptional achievement and statewide impact through his leadership support and advancement of the arts.

David and his wife Martha live in Columbia South Carolina and are the parents of son Daniel and daughters Julia and Alice.

Forrest W. Heaton ’60

Forrest Heaton or “Wally” as he is called by his Albion classmates was known early on for his compassion leadership and love of music. An economics and political science major and Dean’s List student he was also active in Delta Tau Delta fraternity and helped to organize the Charlie Brown Orchestra on campus.

After graduation Heaton went on to a management career with Olivetti Corporation. That culminated in his leadership of the company’s management and sales education/training programs. He then founded two publishing/educational marketing subsidiaries for Prentice Hall Inc. serving as president through 1984. After joining American Express in 1985 he was appointed vice president providing leadership to American Express’ worldwide strategic account management program before his retirement in 1998.

Heaton has many passions which include writing poetry and music. Playing guitar singing and writing music led him to release a self-published DVD entitled Sweet Mary on the St. Croix and later a CD entitled Delts in Duet featuring tenors Tom Leavy and Dick Morse. He also wrote and published Heaton’s Hit Parade Songbook followed by Aunt Mary & Uncle Wally & Friends with the Young at Heart Songbook.

He married his college sweetheart Sally Ann MacArthur ’60 and together they raised three children Matthew Sara and Amanda. Sally died of cancer in 1997. Following her death he established the Heaton Endowment at Albion College which provides scholarship assistance to first-year and/or sophomore females with special interest in literature. The Heaton Endowment also provides motivation for senior women and/or men via the Heaton Prize for top honors in English. Heaton also co-chaired his 50th class reunion at Albion this year.

While living in Summit New Jersey Heaton volunteered with Stephen Ministries at the Central Presbyterian Church where he assisted pastors in one-to-one confidential ministry to members experiencing life difficulties. Through his work in this ministry Heaton met and married his current wife Mary.

He and Mary reside in Pittsboro North Carolina.

Michael A. Jurasek ’81

Mike Jurasek is an everyday hero: a community leader selfless provider of time and financial support and a family man. His story of local boy (Concord High School) becoming a star athlete at Albion College (cross country and track) and then staying to give back to the community makes him a positive role model. Jurasek’s achievements as a teacher coach and member of the community are proof that he is one of the “best of best.”

For more than 25 years he has touched lives in a meaningful way each day as an educator and coach. The academic success of his student athletes consistently exceeds the school’s norm. Through Jurasek’s skillful coaching Albion High School cross country and track teams have set school records won numerous conference titles in both the Twin Valley and Southern Michigan Athletic Conference and garnered multiple state championships.

Jurasek continues to demonstrate genuine leadership dedication and service to others in many ways. With reductions in the local manufacturing sector a majority of the students who attend Albion High School are challenged both socially and economically. He provides guidance and holds the students accountable to do their best. And he has provided the encouragement for young men and women who would not normally consider advanced education or military service to successfully pursue these opportunities. As head coach he has helped his students become collegiate athletic competitors at more than 25 different institutions.

A five-time recipient of Coach of the Year honors within the Albion Public Schools Jurasek is the director of Michigan’s Indoor Track Series and is the current selection chairperson for Team Michigan in the Midwest Meet of Champions. He is an eight-time recipient of the Kellogg Distinguished Educator Award. Jurasek remains active with Albion College cross country and track and field programs in his spare time.

He and his wife Cheryl reside in Concord Michigan. They have two children Lesley and Christopher.

Walter L. Pomeroy ’70

It is incredibly appropriate that during the Albion College Year of Sustainability Walt Pomeroy is being honored by his alma mater. On April 22 1970 just weeks before his graduation from Albion College he was a pioneer in creating and celebrating our nation’s first Earth Day. The geology major appeared on a CBS-TV prime-time special hosted by Walter Cronkite that day Earth Day: A Question of Survival. That was only the beginning of his lifelong dedication to environmental causes. He contacted activists on other college campuses who agreed that the next logical step was the formation of a student lobby for the environment. Described as “lobbyists in blue jeans” by one newspaper the new Michigan Student Environmental Confederation took its message to the state capitol in Lansing.

In 1981 Pomeroy joined the Mid-Atlantic Division of the National Audubon Society and served there as regional vice president. He remained with the society for 17 years. He was later appointed the executive director of the Pennsylvania Organization for Watersheds and Rivers Inc. where he assisted in watershed and river planning environmental clean-up activities and public education programs throughout Pennsylvania. During his professional career Pomeroy helped write and lobby for numerous state and federal environmental laws relating to water and air pollution wildlife habitat preservation and wilderness protection.

His service to his alma mater includes many visits to campus to meet with faculty staff and students. He has also participated in the Geology Department Colloquia and conducted a workshop that focused on environmental activism.

His local community service includes serving as an assistant master for his local Boy Scout troop in Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania. Pomeroy has traveled as a scoutmaster leader at the World Boy Scout Jamboree in Thailand and the Andes foothills in Chile. In 2004 he received the Boy Scout District Award of Merit for his service and leadership in the community. He continues to assist with National Audubon Society field trips as well as consulting to help watershed associations with planning and management concerns.

He and his wife Lin live in Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania. They have two sons Brian and Brent.

Bill Richardson ’62

Bill Richardson’s love of learning and humanity that began and blossomed at Albion College have influenced countless lives throughout Michigan and around the globe.

After college he taught Latin and English in the Pontiac School District at the time one of the finest school systems in Michigan. As the socioeconomic composition of the district evolved Richardson reworked his courses to address the needs of his students and provide them with the communication and research skills that would serve them well after high school. While at Pontiac Central High School Richardson also was the facilitator for Japanese and Russian language instruction as well as the coordinator of programs for the talented and gifted. During his 33 years at Pontiac Central he taught or coached more than 10000 young people.

In 1988 he was recognized by students and the superintendent of schools as a “Prominent Pontiac Teacher” for the high expectations he always held for his students. Richardson was also honored by the Oakland Community College/Detroit Edison Foundation Summer Program designed for at-risk urban students in 1993. The following year he was presented the Comcast Cablevision Educator Award for his unique use of cable television programming in the classroom. He was one of only 28 teachers nationwide selected to participate in the Satellite Educational Resources Consortium (SERC) Japanese Project Facilitators’ Conference in Omaha Nebraska.

Richardson currently works at Oakland University as the director of the summer English Language Institute in Guizhou Province China educating Chinese English teachers in China’s poorest province. Over the past 24 years he has trained more than 4000 English teachers from primary schools to university level most of whom continue to reside in the rural Guizhou province. And he has advanced international understanding through the common medium of literature as well as his open and accepting manner.

Richardson’s wife Lynne passed away in 1977. He currently resides in Waterford Michigan. He has four children—Michael William Jennifer and David ’93.

Jess Womack ’65

Jess Womack is the epitome of a liberal arts education that has lasted a lifetime. A biology major and Dean’s List student Womack discovered diverse interests that included the Albion College Players the Black Student Alliance and student government. He was elected vice president of the Student Senate and was later president of his class. His passion for humanitarian service has spanned decades and continues to benefit society.

Womack proudly served his country as a Peace Corps volunteer in Kenya and as a platoon sergeant with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam. After earning his law degree from the University of Michigan he began his career with the Ford Motor Company and later was appointed senior corporate counsel in environmental affairs for the Atlantic Richfield Company. With a lifelong interest in education Womack later accepted a role as deputy general counsel for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). Currently he is an interim inspector general for LAUSD.

Womack’s volunteer leadership has benefited countless organizations including the Los Angeles Conservancy where he served as vice president the Environmental Law Institute board and the California Lawyer legal journal as an advisory board member. His love for Albion College resulted in his longtime service to his alma mater first on the Alumni Association Board of Directors which ultimately led to his appointment to the Board of Trustees at Albion College. His passion for Albion continues today as he spearheads volunteer College enrollment efforts with Southern California alumni. His personal visits to more than 25 private high schools in Southern California last fall alone only underscores his unqualified commitment to Albion College.

His career is filled with awards and accolades. As president for the ACCA Southern California Chapter he was recognized as an ACCA Diversity Award winner. Womack also received the Distinguished Service Award from the Los Angeles Conservancy and received a similar award as president of the John M. Langston Bar Association.

He and his wife Beverley reside in Sherman Oaks California.

William R. Goudie ’63 and Janet Matilo Goudie ’64

Considered to be the quintessential Albion College couple Bill and Janet Goudie have continued to be active in College affairs. Their love for one another that began on the Albion campus has extended to include a lasting love for Albion. For over 25 years their individual and dual responses have been “yes” to virtually any volunteer request from their alma mater. They are an inspiration for students and alumni alike as the consummate volunteer couple giving freely of their time talent and treasure for the sake of Albion. Through the years the Goudies have promoted and served Albion as regional event volunteers as enrollment volunteers and as campaign committee members and annual giving volunteers in addition to serving on reunion committees. They both attend every reunion Homecoming or alumni event that their schedules allow.

The Goudies have not only been loyal volunteers; they have assumed significant leadership roles in their service to Albion. Janet has served on the Albion College Board of Trustees and is currently an honorary trustee. Bill is a past president of the Alumni Association Board of Directors and served on both the Gerstacker Institute Visiting Committee and on the Planned Giving Advisory Council. Bill and Janet’s tireless dedication to Albion is a continuation of their involvement on campus as students when Bill was active in Delta Tau Delta fraternity and served as editor-in-chief for The Pleiad while Janet was president of Alpha Xi Delta and an honors student.

After he earned his M.B.A. in finance from the University of Michigan Bill Goudie’s career led him to leadership roles in the banking industry in metropolitan Detroit. He recently retired as first vice president of the financial institutions group with Comerica Bank and was formerly president of Manufacturers Bank of Southfield. Janet Goudie currently works for Doncaster a women’s clothing company as a fashion consultant. She has also been active with P.E.O. and was a founding member and president of the Paint Creek Center for the Arts.

They live in Rochester Michigan and are the parents of two sons Doug ’92 and Ted. Doug Goudie was inducted into Albion’s Athletic Hall of Fame this weekend.

The Goudies’ dual service to their alma mater makes them most deserving of being the second couple to be jointly honored as distinguished alumni.

Wilbur S. Hurst ’61

When Wilbur Hurst was a student at Albion College he earned a reputation as a serious scholar in the classroom and a successful runner on both the men’s track and field team and on the men’s cross country team. Since then he has earned a reputation as a humanitarian and a scientist receiving recognition as a community leader for the Presidential Conversation on Race and the prestigious Edward Bennett Rosa Award from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Commerce Bronze Medal.

A member of Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa at Albion Hurst went on to earn his master’s degree from the University of Pennsylvania before being awarded his Ph.D. from Pennsylvania State University. These accomplishments led to a 40-year career as a physicist with the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. Department of Commerce.

James D. Rogers ’69

James Rogers came to Albion knowing he would pursue a career in medicine. How expansive this career would become and how many lives he would touch in the years that followed his graduation were beyond his imagination.

Rogers earned his medical degree from Wake Forest University where he received the Mosby Award for Scholastic Excellence from the Bowman Gray School of Medicine. He completed surgical residencies at Yale University and New York University. A cardiovascular surgeon he began his career as an associate professor of surgery for Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and later was an attending surgeon for the St. John’s and Cox Medical Centers in Springfield Missouri.

Molly Ann Swart ’82

Molly Swart credits her Albion experience as a member of the Ford Institute’s first class in 1978 for having a significant role in shaping her world view her career and her life. A SOAR leader and Lomas Project 250 Award winner while a student she says Albion helped provide her with the confidence to pursue and win a $25000 Rotary Foundation Ambassadorial Scholarship for study abroad after graduation. That led to two years in Toulouse France where she learned more than just the language and culture. That experience set her on her career path in international business.

Swart’s life has personified the phrase “think globally.” After a brief stint as a technical interpreter for French foreign trade expositions Swart joined the French Embassy Trade Office/Ubifrance. Now senior trade advisor there she serves as the liaison for French industries doing business in the U.S. assisting the companies in attracting and retaining U.S. customers marketing their products and organizing banking tax accounting immigration and legal affairs.

Craig Conover flat-out accused co-star Madison LeCroy of sleeping around with an (unnamed) famous MLB player who turned out afterwards to be Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod denied the allegations at the time but his longtime engagement with Jennifer Lopez would come to an end a few months later. Of late another co-star claimed to believe that LeCroy’s alleged fling with A-Rod did happen – and LeCroy is seemingly having none of it.

Specifically it was Leva Bonaparte that affirmed on S’More Date’s Instagram Live that she thinks the A-Rod hookup accusations involving Madison LeCroy were legitimate. Bonaparte a relatively new castmate on Southern Charm didn't explain her conviction further but her “yeah” response was apparently heard by LeCroy herself. The notoriously shady and longtime Bravo alum supposedly clapped back at the insinuation in the clip per Page Six by saying:

Stuck in 2019 & still doesn’t know the facts [laughing emoji].

So far as we know the supposed real facts according to Madison LeCroy are such that she did have communication with A-Rod but that no physical contact hookup fling or otherwise took place. In the wake of the bombshell reunion LeCroy claimed that the two of them were only “acquaintances.” Yet the Southern Charm alum would joke later on about JLo's reignited romance with ex Ben Affleck with a “You’re welcome.”

It's believed that the Bravo star will have to speak more on the A-Rod issue in the upcoming season of Southern Charm. However her relationship with new fiancé Brett Randle will apparently be off limits – because he doesn't want to be part of the show. And who can blame him? His arrival on the scene follows much controversy... The starlet would also add that their future wedding doesn't include any of her castmates on the guest list either.

If it wasn't already clear by Lena Bonaparte’s casual commentary or Madison LeCroy’s blacklisted wedding list there is reportedly discord amongst the cast in Season 8. As reported by Us Weekly in December Bonaparte unfollowed several co-stars including LeCroy Kathryn Dennis LeCroy’s ex-boyfriend Austen Kroll and Craig Conover. She then posted a vague statement on her Instagram Stories that said:

I can’t be around people who think my accomplishments successes and future opportunities are competition. If we can’t be happy for one another we have nothing in common.

Clearly there's more drama brewing in Charleston. Whether it's A-Rod related old drama with exes or Kathryn Dennis' custody issues Southern Charm fans should be in for a doozy. Season 8 will have the previous lineup of stars with Naomie Olindo returning after a brief absence from the divisive seventh season. The new season is expected to premiere on Bravo in the spring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb3JvZGVvLmNvbS9yZXN1bHQvMjAyMi9zb3V0aGVybi1taXNzLWNvY2EtY29sYS1yb2Rlby8xMTY1NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern Miss Coca-Cola Rodeo,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVzb3V0aGVybi9uYW1lL2RhbGUtaGFycmlzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyNTIxNzYy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dale Harris Obituary (1937 - 2022) - Denver CO - The Southern Illinoisan,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/thesouthern/name/dale-harris-obituary?id=32521762 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVzb3V0aGVybi9uYW1lL2RhbGUtaGFycmlzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyNTIxNzYy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

While the low-fare airline giant rapidly expanded its route network to new cities to capture incremental demand that it could not serve previously it didn't see the financial benefits that bullish investors had expected.

For the full year Southwest lost about $1.3 billion excluding grants received from the federal airline payroll support programs. And whereas Southwest Airlines stock rallied to a multiyear high of nearly $65 last April the shares have since shed about a third of their value ending last week at $42.93.

Fortunately Southwest Airlines finally returned to profitability last quarter. Furthermore the company's results should improve significantly over the next few years as air travel patterns normalize.

A solid end to the year

In October Southwest projected that its fourth-quarter revenue would fall 15% to 25% compared to 2019. Combined with rising fuel prices and nonfuel unit cost inflation this implied that it would post yet another quarterly loss.

However at the carrier's investor day in early December management revealed that demand had recovered rapidly in the preceding weeks with particular strength around the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally Southwest Airlines signed a new co-branded credit card agreement with Chase in early December featuring improved economic terms. That put the company on track to record a profit in the fourth quarter.

Ultimately Southwest booked $5.05 billion of revenue for the fourth quarter: down 11.8% from 2019 on an 8.3% capacity reduction. This allowed the company to withstand higher fuel prices and a 10.6% increase in adjusted nonfuel unit costs compared to two years earlier and earn a profit of $0.14 per share. That beat the analyst consensus of $0.07.

Expecting a quick rebound from the omicron variant

At the time of Southwest Airlines' investor day management anticipated that the company would earn a profit in every quarter of 2022. Unfortunately the severe impact of the omicron variant on demand and staffing has thrown a wrench into those plans.

Southwest estimates that it will miss out on $330 million of revenue in January and February combined because of this short-term drop in demand. As a result first quarter revenue is set to decline 10% to 15% compared to Q1 2019 on approximately 9% less capacity.

Meanwhile the impact of capacity cuts and an incentive program to keep planes flying despite a surge in sick calls will drive a 20% to 24% increase in nonfuel unit costs over the same period. Fuel costs have moved higher too. This will cause Southwest to book a loss for the first quarter.

However with COVID-19 case counts starting to decline again in the U.S. demand is already recovering. By the month of March Southwest expects to be back in the black and profitability should continue to strengthen over the course of 2022 as demand improves and cost pressures ease.

Finally worth a look again

For most of 2021 investor euphoria about the potential post-pandemic recovery had Southwest Airlines stock trading at levels that didn't leave much room for error. Not surprisingly that led to poor share price performance as the airline experienced various setbacks in the second half of the year.

By contrast Southwest Airlines stock now trades at an attractive valuation of 10 times its 2019 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.27. Southwest has numerous initiatives to boost EPS beyond that level including fleet upgrades and efforts to boost fares by appealing to more business travelers. Additionally the company has a substantial amount of excess cash that it will likely return to shareholders once restrictions on dividends and buybacks expire later this year.

To be fair I remain concerned about Southwest's rising costs. Management projects that adjusted nonfuel unit costs will rise 12% to 16% this year compared to 2019 before easing somewhat in 2023. Other airlines did a better job of finding permanent cost savings over the past two years. Higher costs could offset much of the benefit from Southwest's revenue initiatives.

Yet the risk of rising costs pressuring profitability appears to be baked into Southwest Airlines' stock price today. That makes this stock worth a look for investors who want to bet on an airline industry recovery.

U.S. carriers on Friday canceled thousands of flights through the weekend in anticipation of a winter storm forecast to bring high winds and heavy snow across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.

The National Weather Service said in an advisory that the Nor’easter would result in dangerous blizzards and make travel “nearly impossible.” Flight-tracking service FlightAware reported about 4900 U.S. flights were canceled between Friday and Sunday.

Delta Air Lines said it would suspend operations at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports in New York Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey and Logan airport in Boston from Saturday through Sunday morning.

The Atlanta-based carrier canceled 1290 flights from Friday to Sunday. Customers who would have traveled then were allowed to reschedule to different flights without extra cost.

“Delta teams are focused on a safe and orderly restart of operations at these airports and others in the Northeast Sunday afternoon depending on conditions” the company said in a statement.

Similarly American Airlines canceled about 1160 flights as it expects “significant” impact from the storm on its Northeast operations especially at Logan airport. Affected passengers can rebook flights without change fees.

New York-based JetBlue canceled about 500 flights through Sunday including half of its scheduled flights on Saturday.

United Airlines has cut 21% of its Saturday flights according to FlightAware.

The storm has added to the challenges facing the airline industry which is trying to recover from turbulence caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant. An increase in COVID-19 infections among employees has left carriers short staffed forcing them to cancel flights.

Southwest Airlines Co on Thursday said about 5000 employees or roughly 10% of its workforce had contracted the virus in the first three weeks of January. The company has canceled more than 5600 flights thus far this month which is estimated to cost it $50 million in revenue.

Flights through Boston Logan Airport continue to be affected by Saturday’s snowstorm with more than 200 flights cancelled Sunday alone.

However this is an improvement upon Saturday’s air travel status. According to FlightAware.com Boston Logan has only cancelled around 50 percent of the anticipated flights departing from the airport. And only 24 percent of flights landing in Boston were cancelled as opposed to the 100 percent cancellation rate Saturday.

The airlines affected include Delta American Airlines JetBlue and others. Ahead of the storm Boston Logan released a statement on Twitter asking passengers to check their flight status for Saturday and Sunday in anticipation of cancellations and delays.

Due to the expected storm Boston Logan and airports along the east coast may experience delays and cancellations in operations Sat 1/29 and Sun 1/30.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWNvZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtMDUxNDExOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Stanley Black & Decker Inc's latest SEC 10-Q filing.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

2 Footprint Rationalization costs in 2024 primarily relate to accelerated depreciation of production equipment of $4.9 million and other

facility exit and re-configuration costs of $10.0 million. In 2023 transfers and closures of targeted manufacturing sites including Fort Worth Texas

and Cheraw South Carolina as previously announced in March 2023 resulted in accelerated depreciation of production equipment of $17.0 million

and non-cash asset write-downs of $42.2 million (predominantly tooling raw materials and WIP).











3 Strategic Sourcing & Operational Excellence costs in 2023 primarily relate to third-party consultant fees to provide expertise in identifying and

quantifying opportunities to source in a more integrated manner and re-design in-plant operations following footprint rationalization developing

a detailed program and related governance and assisting the Company with the implementation of actions necessary to achieve the related objectives.











4 Acquisition & integration-related costs primarily relate to the MTD and Excel acquisitions including costs to integrate the organizations and

shared processes as well as harmonize key IT applications and infrastructure.











5 Includes deal-related costs net of income related to providing transition services to previously divested businesses.











6 The $25.5 million pre-tax asset impairment charge in 2024 related to the Infrastructure business.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

This year two clear favorites are emerging among Starbucks' newest collection — Pink Lemonade soft-touch jelly cups as well as a rare domed kaleidoscope cold cup in a pearlescent white.

Collectors are heading to retailers to find these limited-edition cups now and Starbucks may continue to release new items throughout the season.

Love is definitely in the air for Starbucks fans this week as diehard coffee aficionados are discovering that new Valentine's Day-themed merchandise has landed in cafés across the country.

If you're a fan of this beloved February holiday be sure to keep an eye out for a slew of new pink-hued coffee tumblers water bottles and ceramic mugs that are landing in retail locations now (they make for great gifts!). A huge fan favorite so far seems to be a new soft-touch studded opaline tumbler in rose pink which has been released in two sizes including the 16 ounce Grande and the more popular 24 ounce Venti. Social media users including popular account @starbucksnsunshine have referred to these cheery hues as ""pink lemonade"" in their descriptions.

Like other seasonal releases social media users have noticed these new cups are retailing between $19.95 and $24.95 with prices and availability fluctuating in Canada and other international markets.

But Starbucks isn't releasing just a single new Valentine's Day cup — earlier this winter eagle-eyed coffee lovers noticed a slow trickle of new domed heart tumblers in a blazing red featuring a print heart motif. The heart motif carries over into a new water bottle option as well as a few ceramic mugs for those who enjoy hot coffee instead. Plus we're seeing evidence of new reusable lidded coffee cups for folks who can't enough of their color-changing prowess.

On top of all that there's also a good chance you'll be able to get your hands on a heart-themed cup of your own. There could be as many as five different items to shop this season.

Starbucks hasn't officially confirmed the extent of its forthcoming Valentine's Day collection but evidence collected by social media users suggests that there are even more new cups and mugs to grab. It seems the coffee giant is also releasing winter 2022 items that Starbucks fans haven't seen before. Among them are an emerald green grid cold cup and a dark hunter green soft-touch studded cup — both in Venti sizes.

A new pearlescent dome cup is indeed turning heads thanks to its design which is reminiscent of the wildly popular early summer 2021 collection that Starbucks fans quickly bought out. It seems this may be the toughest cup to source this season though fans have been already on the hunt for this seasonal find that only comes in a large Venti size.

If you're out searching for one of these new Starbucks cups your best bet is to start at your local Target. Odds are it most likely hosts a Starbucks retail location. Starbucks' merchandise collectors have long established that these retail locations in malls airports and big-box superstores (as opposed to standalone cafés) often receive first shipments of new merchandise collections in bulk. There's also a possibility that more winter 2022 merchandise will be released in the upcoming weeks — we'll update this post with more information as it becomes available. Happy shopping!

We all have preferences when it comes to what goes in our coffee. But in a world where you can order a cup of joe on an app and have a server customize it to your exact taste it might be too easy to go overboard with those preferences. At least that seems to be the case with a recent Starbucks order that has the Reddit community and other social media users chatting up a storm.

A Starbucks worker originally shared their concern along with a photo of the order on Twitter tweeting the following message as part of a multi-part post: ""Partners brought forth concerns about mobile ordering practices & how additional staff is needed to address orders like this which only took 50 stars to order with a price ticket of over 24$. 5 minute wait time from the app which is longer than it would take to pull shots alone.""

The photo reveals the order was for a Venti Decaffeinated Pike Place coffee and a grocery list of add-ons which included 12 pumps of Mocha 12 sugars 12 raw sugars whipped cream and every type of creamer and milk alternative. And the list goes on. The post was liked over 5000 times and retweeted more than 460 times. If you think this is an excessive order you are not alone. Reddit threads resharing this order have popped up with the community expressing support for the poor coffee shop employee expected to create this drink.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWNha2UtcG9wcy10aWt0b2sv0gE8aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlkb3QuY29tL2lybC9zdGFyYnVja3MtY2FrZS1wb3BzLXRpa3Rvay8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘We close in ten minutes’: Customer tries ordering over 100 cake pops from Starbucks in viral TikTok,"An alleged Starbucks barista recently claimed that a woman wanted to place an order at her location for over 100 cake pops within an hour of the store closing.

A video showing all of the receipts for the woman’s order was uploaded to TikTok by Liv (@livvie3304). The short video shows printed receipts for 93 items all for a woman named Kim.

Text overlay on the video which has over 824000 views reads: “We close in 10 minutes …”

In a follow-up post Liv explained that the woman actually requested 160 cake pops in Starbucks’s chocolate and earth cake flavors.

“In all honesty the cookie dough ones were the best but we don’t have those anymore” Liv said in her video. “She’s about to get booty ass cake pops for whatever function she’s going to.”

She continued: “We’re not a catering company. You can literally make them at home and they’ll come out 10 times better.”

The woman Kim eventually came into the store and bought 93 items including 59 cake pops. The rest of the order comprised frosted snowman cookies. In the comments of her original video Liv said the total for the order was $293.12 and the workers gave Kim “what we had.”

The customer needed the pastries for a winter-themed “sweet 17” birthday party. Liv said that Kim was “nice” and that the two talked about where Liv wanted to go to college.

Still Liv suggested Kim’s large order lengthened the amount of time needed to close the store. As a minor Liv said she can’t stay after the store closes but she’s tasked with helping the store prepare for closing. The cake pop order gave her less time to help her co-workers shut the store down and they ended up staying an hour after the 10 pm closing time.

In response to questions about whether Kim tipped Liv said she wasn’t sure.

“Another question was did she tip and she paid with the app so she might have tipped on the app. But I don’t think she gave a cash tip” Liv said.

As a result several commenters were shocked that the woman was able to place such a large order. Many people said it was inconsiderate of her to do so—especially so close to the store closing.

“People like this have never worked food service and it shows” reads one comment.

“Nah that’s a catering order and needs to be placed 24 hours in advance” said another viewer.

“As a Starbucks barista I would have told her to leave” commented another TikToker.

The Daily Dot has reached out to Liv via TikTok comment and Starbucks via email.

“When does sakura season start?” is a difficult question to answer since Japan’s cherry blossom trees are notoriously fickle. The even trickier question though is “When does sakura sweets season start?”

You might expect sakura sweets season to coincide with when the cherry blossoms bloom in late March/early April. However the most traditional sakura-related confectionary sakura mochi (which uses the leaves of the sakura tree) is customarily eaten as part of the Hinamatsuri celebration (also known as the Doll Festival or Girl’s Day) which is held on March 3. You could also apply the logic that by the old Japanese calendar spring started the day after Setsubun (the bean-throwing festival) which takes place on Feb 3 and so even early February is an appropriate time for sakura sweets.

That third way of thinking seems to be the one Starbucks Japan is going by in the timing of the release of its newest dessert drink the Sakura White Chocolate with Milk Pudding.

The drink is the latest addition to Starbucks Japan’s Chilled Cup line which is offered exclusively at Japanese convenience stores. While many of the Chilled Cup varieties are coffee or coffee-based this pure dessert beverage is all about creamy indulgence not caffeine fixes. Starbucks partner Suntory promises a fragrant cherry blossom aroma sweet white milk chocolate and a satisfyingly substantial pudding-like texture. If you’ve never had the pleasure of tasting sakura sweets they usually have a trace of palate-cleansing saltiness to this aftertaste as well.

▼ If you were disappointed by Starbucks’ previous fascination with adding strawberry flavor to its sakura drinks you’ll be happy to know that there’s no such fruity interference here.

Special to The Dispatch

St. John Arena has been a fixture on the Ohio State University campus since it opened in 1956. It was built specifically for basketball and was home to the men’s and women’s teams until 1998 when games were moved to the new Value City Arena.

Thousands of high school athletes competed amid great fanfare in state tournaments at St. John over the decades and Ohio State's wrestling gymnastics and volleyball teams called it home until 2019 when they moved to the new Covelli Center. The arena also hosted rock concerts from 1968 to 1980 – Elton Elvis and more.

St. John still holds big events but different ones. Last year it hosted a pop-up mass COVID-19 vaccination clinic. It is also used for student events such as technology pickup.

The traditional “Skull Session” pep rally held prior to OSU’s home football games for almost a century is still held at the arena and very occasionally a home basketball game is scheduled there.

The venue was named after Lynn St. John known as “Saint” who coached Ohio State baseball and basketball and was later the university’s athletic director for several decades until he retired in 1947. He was instrumental in the construction of Ohio Stadium as well as the arena which was still in the planning stages when he died in 1950.

St. John Arena is remembered fondly in part for its architecture which had an intimate design (13276 capacity) and put fans close to the action. It also helped to bring honor and prestige to campus. After it was built within just a few seasons the Buckeyes were national basketball champions and earned five straight Big Ten titles.

The plan to demolish the arena once the Covelli Center opened has been delayed. It is unclear what the future holds for the building which is so fondly remembered.

CONCERT TICKETS

Columbus concertgoers flocked to the arena before bigger venues in the city were built. Upper-balcony seating at concerts was banned there in the mid-’70s after an engineering report indicated that rhythmic stomping and clapping could sway the structure beyond allowable stresses. The last rock concert there was a Black Sabbath show more than 40 years ago.

Search process

The last three chancellors of the UA System were appointed unanimously by the board of trustees and no other candidates were interviewed during the hiring process. UA System spokesperson Lynn Cole confirmed a similar process for most chancellors before that.

The chancellor reports directly to the UA System board of trustees and is hired by the board. Duties of the chancellor include implementing board policies establishing financial procedures for the University and working with the governor’s office and any state or federal agencies according to Article 5 of the UA System Board Manual.

“The Board of Trustees conducts the search process and identifies individuals who possess the attributes and qualifications necessary to perform the duties established by the Board and Board Bylaws and Rules” Cole said in a statement. “The most recent Chancellor search was consistent with this process.”

Frank LoMonte director of the Brechner Center for Freedom of Information at the University of Florida and former director of the Student Press Law Center said a private search process without interviewing other candidates only serves board members.

LoMonte said it’s becoming increasingly common to do these searches “entirely behind closed doors” which is a “terrible management practice and it’s definitely no way to run a government agency.”

“The takeaway when you have a closed search is that the only people who matter are the trustees and the trustees are always unrepresentative of the general public. The trustees are always disproportionately wealthy business people. The choice is never going to be representative of all of the campus community stakeholders” LoMonte said.

A common legal trend

Cole said the majority of the eight chancellor searches have been conducted without interviews.

“When the Board of Trustees conducts the search for the UA System’s top leadership position the process is tailored to the needs and strategic priorities of our three campuses and the UAB Health System” Cole said. “Due to the targeted nature of Chancellor searches oftentimes only the final candidate is formally interviewed by the Board. This was the approach for most of our eight Chancellor searches.”

Cole said in an email in December that while the board “advertised the position online and considered several candidates” there was no interview process before appointing St. John.

“Because the board came to this unanimous decision there was no need to conduct formal interviews with the other candidates under consideration” Cole said. “This is not unusual for chancellor searches and is entirely at the Board’s discretion.”

LoMonte said this is a common legal trend.

“The law is typically not on the public’s side and it’s only getting worse” he said. “The general trend everywhere across America is to take these executive searches behind closed doors. There are a small handful of states where the public is clearly entitled by law to see at least the finalists but there is an ongoing battle to close the process even in those states. It’s always the trustees and their private executive search firms pushing for less and less disclosure.”

Alabama state law

LoMonte said he believes Alabama state law does not lend itself to accessibility within executive searches.

“The law is so bad in most states including Alabama about access to anything that looks like it’s a sensitive executive personnel decision” he said. “There are broad exemptions in many states for executive personnel decisions so that neither the records nor the meetings happen have to be open to the public. That’s just an unfortunate reality of the law that powerful people write these laws and they write them to suit themselves.”

Sid Trant UA System general counsel and senior vice chancellor requested an opinion in 2019 from the Alabama attorney general’s office on whether the board of trustees has “exclusive authority” to appoint individuals to chief administrative roles including president and chancellor. Attorney General Steve Marshall wrote that the board does hold that authority.

LoMonte said the decision to request a legal opinion “suggests there was at least some uncertainty about the legality.”

The opinion was released March 20 2019 less than a month before St. John was appointed.

Chancellor St. John

St. John served on the board of trustees for 17 years before being selected as the UA System’s interim chancellor in August 2018. The board of trustees removed the “interim” label from St. John’s title and unanimously appointed him as chancellor on April 12 2019.

St. John’s annual base salary is $730361 and he can receive an annual performance incentive of $105000. He also receives a $12000 annual car allowance and a $6250 monthly housing allowance. St. John was paid over $1 million including the car and housing allowances in 2021.

LoMonte said transitioning from a long-held board position directly to the chancellor position is a “very unusual route.”

“It’s not unheard of but it’s certainly not the primary method or the preferred method” he said. “The downside risks are obvious. You’re at risk of getting somebody who is a political crony rather than somebody who is the best qualified. Also you’re not going to allow for the possibility that an outsider with a broader perspective might want the job. When you make an insider choice without doing a nationwide search then you foreclose the possibility of bringing in new thinking.”

Chancellor Ray Hayes

Former UA System Chancellor Ray Hayes was also selected by a unanimous board decision in 2015 without a search process. Hayes served for three years as the UA System’s executive vice chancellor for finance and operations before becoming chancellor. Hayes’ salary was more than $653000 not including the yearly performance incentive.

“I want to say this publicly” former trustee John England Jr. said at a 2015 board of trustees meeting where Hayes was appointed. “I am aware as others are aware that we received some concerns from faculty about having input about the chancellor. We had in our midst an outstanding candidate and so we did not have that national search but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t considered.”

The Crimson White contacted 15 current and former members of the Faculty Senate. The majority did not respond with one member declining an on-the-record interview due to concerns about retaliation from the University.

Chancellor Robert Witt

Former chancellor Robert Witt was also appointed unanimously to replace Malcolm Portera by the board of trustees in 2012. Witt served as president of The University of Alabama for nine years before being appointed chancellor. No other candidates were considered for the position after members of the board approached Witt. Witt’s annual base salary was $660000.

Cole said “several individuals” were considered during the search before St. John was appointed. Cole did not share the identities of those individuals due to privacy concerns.

“The pool of individuals was a diverse group representing a broad range of professional experiences from leading institutions of higher education to leaders in government and business” she said.

UGA’s chancellor search

The University of Georgia publicized its 2021 chancellor search with a website that included contact information for public feedback dates for listening sessions discussing the chancellor search and regular timeline updates.

“The Regents Search Advisory Group has scheduled listening sessions to receive input from students faculty staff and the public on its search for the next chancellor of the University System of Georgia” a statement on the website said.

UGA students protested the board’s consideration of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue as chancellor. Perdue was also the United States secretary of agriculture under President Donald Trump. The current UGA chancellor Steve Wrigley served as chief of staff to Georgia Gov. Zell Miller. The previous chancellor Hank Huckaby was Zell’s budget director.

Students within the University of Georgia system started a public campaign Students Against Sonny in an attempt to delay Perdue’s appointment as chancellor. LoMonte said public access is the reason the board is placing a hold on the search.

LoMonte said this highlights the political nature of closed-door executive search decisions.

“It’s not at all uncommon that you put people into the chancellorship because they know how to work at the highest levels of state government” LoMonte said. “There’s nothing wrong with taking that into account but when you do it secretly behind closed doors there’s every risk that the job will be given to somebody in a political deal rather than based on merit.”

Empty offices and closed storefronts have put the vibrancy of downtown Chicago at stake. Almost 18% of downtown office space was vacant at the end of 2021 according to commercial real estate firm CBRE. The closure of major retailers along the Magnificent Mile such as Macy’s and Gap left massive holes in the city’s best-known shopping district.

Office use and shopping habits were changing long before the pandemic but were exacerbated by COVID-19 shutdowns. As the city tries to emerge from the pandemic downtown faces myriad challenges: a changing office landscape in the Loop a decline in retail activity along the Magnificent Mile concerns about crime.

Meeting those challenges could mean changes that reshape the face of downtown according to real estate experts researchers and neighborhood groups. Old office buildings could be converted into housing. Michigan Avenue is looking beyond retail to more experiential options. Local businesses might have more chances to expand downtown.

In one sign of that change Hubbard Street Dance Chicago recently moved into an old Adidas store on the fourth floor of Water Tower Place. Adidas is now located elsewhere in the mall.

Hubbard Street Executive Director David McDermott sees the neighborhood’s boutiques universities hospitals cultural institutions and nearby beach as anchors that will keep it durable.

“I think we’ll continue to see a diversification of tenants along North Michigan Avenue” he said. “And we’re happy to be kind of at the leading edge of that.”

Getting there will require bringing people downtown. There were upticks in pedestrian traffic before the omicron wave but with fewer office workers around and amid rising worries about crime employers store owners and landlords are eyeing creative options.

A makeover for old offices

Real estate experts and landlords aren’t worried about companies deserting the urban core but as the need for office space changes so does the outlook for downtown. Fulton Market which at one point seemed overbuilt is now in demand thanks to its newer amenity-heavy buildings said CBRE Vice Chairman Todd Lippman. Dated buildings in the heart of the Loop however are struggling.

“I see a lot of pressure on those buildings and I don’t know that all will come out in good shape” he said. “I do think there will be repurposing.”

Office vacancy at the end of 2021 in the central business district which includes the Loop Fulton Market and River North areas ticked slightly down for the first time during the pandemic according to CBRE. More space was available to sublease than in either of the two prior years but growth in sublease space was slowing the firm said.

Companies want space in new office buildings with plenty of amenities to entice workers back such as cafes entertainment spaces or fitness centers said Jack O’Brien principal of Chicago-based real estate services firm The Telos Group. While many renovations were underway before the pandemic some were adjusted to emphasize outdoor environments. That includes the Old Post Office where a roof deck got additional seating.

For older less desirable office buildings conversions to housing could be a path forward.

That is one option under consideration for a historic office building at 36 W. Randolph St.. With little space to add amenities and working around the building’s landmarked status a conversion to small apartments shared living or a hotel would be most efficient said Steven DeGraff who is part of the group that owns the building.

The building at 36 W. Randolph St. might be converted from second-tier office space to small apartments.

The rent the building could generate from an office tenant wouldn’t justify the construction costs of retrofitting it he said.

“There is a lot of need for housing and that continues” DeGraff said. “And location-wise you’re right in the central business district (where) you don’t have a tremendous amount of apartments yet. So it’s really the market that dictates that.”

A shift toward housing had started before the pandemic. The share of space in Chicago’s central business district devoted to offices shrank from 79% in 2011 to just under 75% earlier in 2021 while multifamily housing grew from 9% to 16% according to CoStar data.

Meanwhile Chicago’s downtown grew faster than any of the country’s other large metro areas between 1980 and 2018 swelling from just over 18000 residents to more than 110000 according to a 2020 report by the Brookings Institution.

With new housing comes demand for services for residents such as day cares schools and gyms. Those can also serve as new uses for old office buildings said Tracy Loh a fellow at the Brookings Institution who co-authored a report on downtowns’ recovery from the pandemic last year.

The conversions come with caveats. Residential buildings are likely to generate less tax revenue than a commercial space would Loh said. And construction could be challenging — for example some old buildings lack bathrooms on each floor said Michael Edwards president and CEO of the Chicago Loop Alliance.

Still Edwards sees conversions as one viable option for downtown. The Loop Alliance is championing alternative funding such as tax credits to help make them successful.

Opportunities for local shops

As office tenants seek buildings with amenities landlords have a big incentive to fill retail and restaurant vacancies left by the pandemic especially when they’re trying to get workers excited about returning said John Vance principal at Stone Real Estate.

There were 208 more empty storefronts in the Loop in mid-2021 than in 2019 a Stone Real Estate report found. Restaurants accounted for 44% of the newly empty space and apparel stores made up 16%.

That could give local businesses an opportunity to expand just as small businesses expanded in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis when big chains were more cautious said Greg Kirsch executive managing director and Midwest retail leader for Cushman & Wakefield.

“Money’s cheap it’s easy to get a loan and there are entrepreneurs who want to get out there” he said.

Willis Tower where about 85% of office space is leased was already planning to focus on “uniquely Chicago” businesses with a redevelopment that started in 2017 and added 300000 square feet of retail space along with other new amenities said David Moore senior vice president and portfolio director of building owner EQ Office.

That included national brands such as Shake Shack Sweetgreen and Starbucks but also local names such as Rick Bayless’ Tortazo Lettuce Entertain You’s Sushi-san Do-Rite Donuts & Chicken and soon Kindling a new restaurant from the Fifty/50 Restaurant Group. Much of the leasing took place pre-pandemic but interest has remained throughout he said.

Fifty/50 had been in talks with Willis Tower’s owners about opening a breakfast spot in the skyscraper before the pandemic but conversations stalled until the fall of 2020 when the building owners reached back out with an opportunity for a full-service restaurant with an outdoor terrace said co-owner Scott Weiner.

Weiner thinks downtown building owners’ interest in local concepts predates the pandemic pointing to food halls such as Revival and said he thinks the neighborhood has “amazing opportunities” even with uncertainty about how the pandemic will affect foot traffic.

“Even when Willis is 20% occupied it still has more people than most buildings in Chicago and there’s a weekend crowd” he said.

Still landlords and prospective retail or restaurant tenants may need to get creative as long as hybrid and remote work could affect the customer base Vance said. That could mean basing rents on a percentage of a retailer’s sales instead of a flat rate he said.

Elsewhere in the Loop Edwards thinks there is a future for retail that is heavy on the experience for shoppers. That could go hand in hand with a shift toward more residential buildings because a growing population downtown would mean more residents nearby to patronize different kinds of stores he said.

“When we all used to work downtown we’d all stay in our neighborhood because we were tired of going downtown” Edwards said. “Well now everyone is in their neighborhood in their house around their street so downtown is becoming much more of a destination on a weekend.”

One damper though has been the perception of crime downtown.

In the first three weeks of the year 600 complaints of crimes including burglaries motor vehicle thefts and violent crimes were reported in the police districts that include downtown and other surrounding neighborhoods according to preliminary Chicago police data. That was up from 412 in the first weeks of 2020.

The Loop Alliance has long had safety patrols on State Street during the day and in recent months hired unarmed security to walk the area after 11 p.m. That was partly in response to complaints that restaurants and bars were having a hard time hiring employees who didn’t feel comfortable walking to or from work late at night Edwards said.

“Downtown cannot be successful until we can restore customer confidence in their experience when they come downtown it can be predictable” he said. “And right now it’s not as predictable as we’d like it to be both on the pandemic side and on the consumer confidence side feeling safe” he said.

A few blocks north along Michigan Avenue addressing crime such as smash-and-grab robberies and carjackings are a key priority for the Magnificent Mile Association said President and CEO Kimberly Bares. Many retailers in the area have hired private security she said.

A new special taxing district on properties in the area will send about 70% of the funds raised toward safety and security measures such as “ambassadors” walking the avenue and surveillance cameras she said.

The association is also urging tougher prosecution and sentencing for repeat offenders Bares said.

Changes on the Mag Mile

There were positive signs for North Michigan Avenue in December. Traffic counters in the 400 block recorded more pedestrians than in the same month pre-pandemic according to the Magnificent Mile Association.

But the high-end retail district is grappling with a shift in how people shop that was exacerbated by the pandemic and has left large vacancies at the Water Tower Place mall and elsewhere along the street. A panel organized by the Urban Land Institute working with the city and the Magnificent Mile Association set out to study solutions for the corridor.

“Shopping and retail has changed” said Swasti Shah director of community engagement for ULI Chicago. “It cannot be just relying on big retail brands and flagship stores.”

Among the panel’s recommendations were to create more places for people to gather and a focus on experiences such as the Dr. Seuss Experience at Water Tower Place or The Office Experience at the Shops at North Bridge. Walkability to tourist destinations such as Navy Pier could be improved. Focusing on local retailers could give people a reason to visit Shah said.

ULI is also convening a panel to study LaSalle Street in the Loop.

Retail will likely always have some presence on Michigan Avenue Bares said but experiences could also be part of the avenue’s future. In addition to pop-ups including The Office and Dr. Seuss experiences she pointed to existing stores such as Eataly or the Starbucks Roastery that feature dining.

The Magnificent Mile Association is also looking at more festivals and events such as the Meet Me On the Mile events in 2021 that closed parts of the street to vehicle traffic.

“In an era where we can buy almost anything we want online what we can’t buy online is experience” Bares said. “And to the extent that anyone can match the best product or service with experience they will be the winner in this new market.”

That shift in focus is in line with Hubbard Street Dance’s recent move to Water Tower.

McDermott said he approached Water Tower’s owner about moving into the space after the dance studio sold its building in 2019. He was drawn to the site after seeing other “experiential” and arts-focused tenants nearby and to the mall’s accessibility to the public he said.

“How can we share Hubbard Street with more people share world-class art with more people?” he said. “I don’t think about it really as a mall. I just think about it as a place to showcase our art.”

But others particularly with office jobs did and many companies generally found it worked well.

Repeated COVID-19 surges delayed return-to-work plans and some companies including Synchrony Financial which employed 1900 at its former Kettering office decided to go remote permanently.

Explore Pandemic tempers optimism about Dayton region economic prospects in 2022

No one knows how many work from home. That will become more clear once people file tax returns for 2021 and refund requests start rolling in from those whose employers withheld taxes at the company’s location but they actually worked from home or some other remote location.

The big winners will be people who paid local taxes where their companies were located but actually worked from home in townships or municipalities with no or lower income taxes. They can apply for refunds but if they do they must pay what is due to their home city.

It gets complicated for hybrid workers who split their time between the office and home in 2021. Those hours need to have been tracked and certified by the company to get a refund from the workplace city and the refund would be only for the portion of time worked at home.

“The law basically says the tax is due where the work is done” said Amy Arrighi chief legal counsel for the Regional Income Tax Agency which administers income taxes for about 356 cities and villages in Ohio.

More than 600 of the state’s 940 cities and villages levy a municipal tax with workers paying an income tax and businesses a net profits tax. The state’s 1300 townships cannot levy income taxes.

About $6 billion in municipal taxes are collected annually Scarrett said and that tax covers 70% to 80% of municipalities’ general operating revenues for services like police and fire public works trash and recreation.

“Municipalities of all sizes are concerned about how this might shake out” said Arrighi. “If you think about a small municipality with one large employer that drives their tax dollars and suddenly sends everyone home or has them at home part of the time that could have an impact. It’s not just a big city issue.”

Where you owe taxes

Under Ohio law a company withholds local income taxes from employees’ paychecks for the city where it’s located. If the employee lives somewhere else the employee must also pay that income tax unless their home city offers a credit for taxes paid to another city.

Many local jurisdictions offer those credits typically for half or all of the taxes paid where the employee works.

For example Dayton has a 2.5% income tax rate and Kettering a 2.25%. A person who lives in Kettering and works in Dayton gets 100% credit from Kettering for taxes paid to Dayton and does not owe anything to Kettering.

The workplace cities do not share any of the money with the home city.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic companies whose employees worked off site for more than 20 days were required to also withhold taxes for those locations.

Companies with annual revenues of less than $500000 were allowed to simply withhold in the company’s city and employees who worked off-site were responsible for applying for refunds and paying taxes where they actually worked.

Companies with a remote workforce knew the rules and had systems set up to comply said John Parks shareholder and certified public accountant at Clark Schaefer Hackett in Miami Twp. and a member of the Dayton Daily News Community Advisory Board.

After the pandemic shutdown in March 2020 Ohio passed emergency rules allowing companies who sent employees home to work to continue withholding income taxes where the company was located allowing the cities to continue getting that revenue.

Last summer before that emergency rule expired the legislature passed a law permitting companies to continue that withholding practice through Dec. 31 but said pre-pandemic rules would return in 2022. Businesses must now track where employees work and withhold taxes and pay net profits taxes in those locations.

“A lot of people think this is a new law. But it’s been around for years” said Greg Saul director of tax policy for the Ohio Society of CPAs. “A lot of people in an office setting are seeing it for the first time.”

The legislature left it up to the employee who worked from home in 2021 to apply for a refund from the work city and then to pay the home city any taxes owed Arrighi said.

“Nothing in the law says that a taxpayer has to request that refund” she said.

And the home city also is not allowed to force the taxpayer to get a refund and then pay their home city tax for 2021 Arrighi added.

Work-from-home employees are not eligible for refunds for 2020 but Arrighi said RITA has about 1700 refund requests that are being held pending court challenges.

What will be the impact on cities?

The state’s tax withholding emergency rule for 2020 was upheld in a 10th District Court of Appeals ruling last year. But the Buckeye Institute the Columbus-based conservative think tank that filed the lawsuit recently appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court in an effort to overturn the law and force cities to refund money to taxpayers who worked from home.

“It would be catastrophic not just for Dayton but for all of the large cities because of the shutdown period and the extent of work from home that occurred in 2020” Dayton City Manager Shelley Dickstein said.

Dayton already anticipates losing $35 million in income tax revenue over the next three years due to people working from home. Looking just at employment in the office-heavy downtown district Dickstein estimated the city would pay out an additional $40 million to those workers if forced to do refunds for 2020.

“In 2022 we’d essentially have all of our (COVID) rescue funds go to people who generally increased their wealth during this pandemic and we would not be able to do the kind of investments into our neighborhoods and address the true impact of COVID on our poor and disenfranchised communities” Dickstein said.

A study of 10 Ohio cities including Dayton Kettering and Springfield projects that about one-third of the workforce could continue to work from home either full-time or on a hybrid basis said Keary McCarthy executive director of the Ohio Mayors Alliance which commissioned the study.

The study projects a possible loss of annual municipal tax revenue as high as $21.9 million for Dayton $6.4 million for Kettering and $4 million for Springfield according to the October report.

“The concern is about the long-term impacts on municipal budgets as a result of a big shift to remote working” McCarthy said.

Projected loss municipal tax revenue - Annual in millions of dollars Impact of people working from home instead of employer city. City High Medium Low Akron $20.0 $11.8 $7.8 Cincinnati $43.0 $24.5 $15.7 Columbus $110.3 $62.9 $40.2 Dayton $21.9 $12.6 $8.2 Elyria $4.8 $3.0 $2.0 Fairfield $1.6 $1.0 $0.6 Kettering $6.4 $3.9 $2.7 Springfield $4.0 $2.3 $1.5 Strongsville $2.2 $1.4 $1.0 Toledo $15.8 $9.2 $6.1 Source: Ohio Mayors Alliance study conducted by PFM Group Consulting LLC

Some cities like Kettering will see revenues increase as residents who formerly commuted now work from home. But Kettering has a lot of businesses as well and will lose revenue from nonresidents who no longer come to work there.

“At this point we have estimated as much as $2 million to $3 million negative impact due to the work from home” Kettering City Manager Mark Schwieterman said. “However we will have a better idea of the actual impact after we receive and process the refunds from 2021 related to the work from home.”

Scarrett said the decline in income tax revenue caused by work-from-home already has some cities renegotiating incentive packages they gave companies to locate there. Those packages are typically based on anticipation of income tax revenue.

“There will definitely be an impact on future incentive programs and economic development agreements with businesses” he said. “And I think there will be an impact on existing agreements.”

Businesses have concerns

The Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce held municipal income tax roundtables with members and heard concerns about implementing new withholding and tracking systems for remote workers said Stephanie Keinath chamber vice president of strategic initiatives.

Employers wanted information on how to verify where a remote employee was actually located she said because some might choose to work somewhere other than their home and to minimize the companies’ liability in that verification process.

“The municipal income tax system in Ohio is extremely complex and employers who operated (pre-pandemic) in multiple jurisdictions shared how complicated the tracking and withholding processes could be even for those with smaller teams” Keinath said.

Many employers have not made permanent workforce shifts she said but “there may indeed be long-term shifts to where and how employees are working.”

“Flexibility for employers and minimizing the administrative burden has been key to the debate around municipal income tax reform” Keinath said.

The Buckeye Institute opposes the municipal income tax as outmoded. It says those taxes “discourage work and productivity” and are susceptible to a volatile labor market and broader use of telecommuting according to the group’s new report on funding cities.

“Moving away from local income taxes and toward a property or sales tax regime will take time and planning and will not be easy” according to the report which also recommends cities reduce spending.

Some caution that any change should be carefully thought out because it remains unknown how much remote work will continue when the pandemic ends.

Zach Schiller research director at Policy Matters Ohio a Columbus-based liberal think tank said lawmakers should start by restoring cuts to the local government fund they made a decade ago.

“We should also broaden the municipal income tax to cover unearned income — dividends capital gains from stock etc.” Schiller said. “We should not take steps that will heighten inequality and put more of a load on those who are least able to pay.”

Tips for taxpayers

Look at city websites for tax refund applications and apply early.

Taxes are due April 18. Apply for an extension if you need to have your refund in hand before you can pay your home city.

Applying for a refund is voluntary in 2021 but if you get one you must pay your home city.

The municipalities share information about who has received refunds.

Instead of using different apps to order food message a friend pay your phone bill transfer money and order up a car superapps allow users to do all that from one single platform.

When they get traction superapps can be huge — if the experience in Asia is generalizable to the rest of the world. The specific services offered differ from one superapp to the next but the mix can be powerful when companies get it right. Popular global examples include China’s WeChat with 1.2 bn users Nasdaq-listed Grab with 670 mn users and Indonesia’s Gojek with 125 mn downloads.

Today we look into why superapps are on the rise what they have to do with financial inclusion and why MEA and Egypt specifically are fertile grounds for them. Superapps pitch themselves as a convenience play to large groups of potential users but they’re really all about fintech — an Egypt (and the wider region) is very fertile ground for that.

Superapps are actually really big hairy fintech plays. Globally superapps have a very fintech-focused foundation. Need proof? Paypal launched its own superapp back in September offering a digital wallet direct deposit bill payments peer-to-peer payments shopping tools cash-back rewards and crypto capabilities according to a press statement. It also includes PayPal Savings a high yield savings account provided by Synchrony Bank.

For users this means peace of mind. For founders it means data: While it is easier for users to have access to services via one single window (or screen) superapps can be “super-hoovers” for data collection and behavior tracking which could also result in more earning power for the app. Superapps use their data to “improve operational processes — like using social media and transactional data to risk-assess loan applicants and […] to better target financial products to customers at the exact time they need them” one of the global big four accounting organizations KPMG writes. WeChat for instance is used by over 1.2 bn people majorly in China through its Weixin brand according to a statement which results in a massive amount of data. The app allows users to do everything from messaging paying their restaurant bills and transferring money to booking transportation tickets.

(SOUND SMART- Weixin is WeChat’s domestic version in China while the brand WeChat is the international version.)

While the idea of superapps originated in Asia MEA has seen its own fair share of them over the past years. Dubai-based Careem which was acquired by Uber in 2020 went from being a ride-hailing app to offering grocery delivery and payment services. UAE-based Rizek which launched in Egypt last year offers housekeeping men’s grooming packing and moving pet care beauty and wellness healthcare (yes that includes PCR tests) automotive and maintenance services. You get the idea.

MEA in general is a “fertile land” for the emergence of more superapps. “The prevalence of low-end mobile phones as well as high internet costs in the MEA make superapps an attractive product” a report on the rise of superapps in the region by Economist Impact and Mastercard states. Further reasons include the massive MEA population count which is expected to reach 3.4 bn by 2050 and the need for financial inclusion.

In Egypt all of the above applies. Smartphone penetration stands at over 53% amongst 15-74-year-olds according to the ICT Ministry’s annual report from September 2021. And with a 100+ mn population about 67% remain unbanked we reported last year with 45% of payments being cashless making us the world’s second most banknote-reliant country.

Egypt is already home to three superapps: MNT-Halan MyFawry and Yalla Super App. Let’s meet them before we dive deeper next week into the domestic market:

MNT-Halan- MNT-Halan which started out as a tuk-tuk and motorcycle ride-hailing app has morphed into an epicenter of all things fintech and services. Today it offers BNPL services a digital wallet loan applications bill payments and requesting delivery or a ride. The company is also planning to launch its own payment card soon founder and CEO Mounir Nakhla tells us. MNT-Halan had raised USD 120 mn last September from global investors including Apis Growth Fund II Development Partners International (DPI) and Lorax Capital Partners in what we believe is the largest fintech investment round in the region thus far.

#2 MyFawry- E-payments giant Fawry is turning MyFawry into a superapp. This includes being able to issue MyFawry pre-paid cards and host digital accounts. The aim is to expand the superapp to allow customers to pay invest save manage borrow and shop CMO of Fawry Wael Wahby tells us. So far MyFawry offers hundreds of payments and subscription services discount privileges and the ability to buy gift cards from the different brands in Egypt.

#3 Yalla Super App- A collaboration between fintech startup PaySky Egypt Post and Visa Yalla Super App launched in December PaySky founder Walid Sadek tells us. PaySky is a payment solutions provider for financial institutions merchants enterprises and consumers founded in 2017. Its newly-launched app aims to provide its services to 1 bn consumers and 1 mn companies and merchants over the next 10 years according to a previous press statement.

NEXT WEEK we’ll dive deeper into the apps how investors view them and the challenges they face as they look to grow the market.

Retail workers and those with approved or pending religious or medical exemptions are not subject to the deadline the company said in the companywide memo Friday morning a copy of which was first published by The T-Mo Report.

T-Mobile confirmed the details of its policy in response to GeekWire’s inquiry.

“We understand that this is a deeply personal decision for some employees but we believe that taking this step will put us in the best position to protect our T-Mobile community” the company said in a statement.

The move adds to a broader national discussion over vaccine mandates in corporate settings. The Biden administration last week said it would abandon a regulation imposing a vaccine mandate at companies with more than 100 employees after the regulation was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Like many other tech companies T-Mobile is currently requiring anyone who accesses its offices to be vaccinated. The new policy goes further in applying the requirement to any office worker who is employed by the company and not subject to an exception under the policy.

Some other companies have longer timetables for termination under their vaccine mandates. Google for example plans to put employees on unpaid leave for up to six months before letting them go under its policy.

“We have weighed this issue carefully with the benefit of input from our medical advisors and insights from many other large companies with similar polices and it’s clear that this is the right thing to do to help save lives and prevent serious illness” T-Mobile said in the memo to employees as published by The T-Mo Report.

As an interim step those who do not receive a first dose by Feb. 21 will be placed on unpaid leave according to the memo. For both deadlines the company requires employees to upload proof of vaccination to an internal database. After their second dose they need to get a digital “Magenta Pass” indicating full vaccination.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAxLTI5L3QtbW9iaWxlLXRvLWZpcmUtY29ycG9yYXRlLXN0YWZmLXdoby1kb24tdC1nZXQtdmFjY2luZS1ieS1hcHJpbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile to Fire Corporate Staff Who Don't Get Vaccine by April,"Why did this happen?

T-Mobile’s head of human resources Deeanne King reportedly says employees who’ve only received one dose as of February 21st will be put on unpaid leave.

There will be “limited” exceptions for certain employees

“T-Mobile’s badge-controlled offices continue to be accessible only to those who are vaccinated against COVID-19” T-Mobile said in a statement to The Verge referencing the digital pass system the company uses to keep track of employees’ vaccination status. “We have shared with employees that we are requiring office workers to be fully vaccinated by April 2.” The mobile carrier also stated there will be “limited” exceptions “for certain roles locations and legally mandated accommodations and exemptions.”

As pointed out by Bloomberg the policy applies to corporate employees who regularly or occasionally work in the office. Customer service employees will reportedly need to show proof they received the first dose of a vaccine by February 21st but won’t be put on unpaid leave for failing to do so. Bloomberg also notes technicians and store employees won’t be subject to the mandate although the company still encourages vaccination and frequent testing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vOXRvNW1hYy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8zMC9hdHQtbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LXVubGltaXRlZC1tYXgtcHJlcGFpZC1wbGFuLWZvci00NS1tb250aC13aXRoLTVnLXN1cHBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AT&T launches new 'Unlimited Max' prepaid plan for $45/month with 5G support,"Update: AT&T also sells an Unlimited Plus plan directly through its website for $50 per month with autopay.

AT&T is ramping up its efforts to compete with lower-cost prepaid carriers. The company has announced a new unlimited prepaid plan that costs just $45 in the United States and it includes unlimited 5G data talk and text along with 10GB of data for hotspot use and HD streaming. There is however one catch…

As reported by The Verge the caveat here is that this new unlimited plan is only available through Walmart. Outside of Walmart AT&T’s most affordable unlimited plan is $65 per month and doesn’t include HD streaming.

As long as you can overlook the Walmart exclusivity this is actually a pretty enticing deal for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 users looking for affordable 5G connectivity. In comparison T-Mobile Metro’s prepaid 5G plan costs $50 per month Mint Mobile’s plan costs $40 per month Cricket’s costs $55 per month and Verizon’s Visible plan costs $40 per month. What sets AT&T’s apart is that it supports HD streaming unlike the other options mentioned here.

AT&T is also discounting its previously-available prepaid plans exclusively through Walmart:

AT&T is also offering its other prepaid plans at a discount if activated at Walmart. This includes its 15GB plan for $35 / month instead of $40 as well as its 5GB plan for $25 / month instead of $30. The company notes that customers who qualify for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) can use up to $30 of their subsidy to pay for AT&T’s prepaid plan making the 5GB plan free if the subsidy is applied.

You can learn more about AT&T’s latest pre-paid offering on its website right here. In addition to the new plan AT&T is also discounting some of its prepaid smartphones (but they don’t feature 5G connectivity). You can get the iPhone 11 for $299 or the iPhone SE for $149."
TROW,T Rowe Price,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2FhMzU1MGVhLTE3NWEtNDY2ZC1hYTA5LWYxNmE5MTVlMmJkNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trinny Woodall: from fashion guru to beauty empire founder,"Print this page

The woman once notorious for her tendency to grab the breasts of TV fashion makeover candidates is standing in her office describing the significance of her company’s new enterprise resource planning software or ERP.

Putting local distribution into important markets such as Australia is one plank of the growth plans this year for Trinny London the brand founded by Trinny Woodall. Her longtime partnership with Susannah Constantine on the BBC makeover show What Not to Wear which aired between 2001-2007 became a TV phenomenon.

The exacting eye and very hands-on style that Woodall 57 once brought to the fashion choices and bra fit of thousands of women is now deployed on the premium make-up brand that she founded in 2017. The range is sold almost exclusively online direct to consumer by the company.

Frankly you would forgive Trinny the chief executive for being rather “over” everyone talking about Trinny the boob-grabbing TV presenter.

But she takes it in her stride: “I think careers go in cycles apart from when you finally find your entrepreneurship . . . I had 10 years 10 years 10 years . . . and then I had I’m ready . . . and that was when I was 50. So all of the things I’ve done before in a way have given me this sense of what I can bring to the table when I started Trinny London.”

Sarah-Jane Woodall — Trinny was a childhood nickname that stuck — has always had an entrepreneurial streak. From washing and ironing shirts for £1 a go during her A-levels to selling socks during an unhappy spell as an assistant in the City after following her father into finance: “I didn’t love it. And it was very male dominated . . .[it] went downhill really quickly.”

There was a spell in rehab for alcohol and cocaine addiction before a newspaper column with Constantine led to TV shows and makeovers around the globe. The pair’s Ready2Shop.com fashion advice business launched in the last frenzied months of the first dotcom boom before folding in 2001. Monetising their idea — to collect data from tens of thousands of women that was of interest to big companies — took longer than the market stayed hot.

Still there were leadership lessons from that flop. “Trusting your instincts more” she says. “Raising too much money too quickly because it was unbelievably easy to raise money. It was two meetings and you had it.”

When it came to Trinny London which uses Match2Me an online tool to assemble stackable pots of face eye and lip colour to suit a customer’s complexion Woodall stuck by both the things she learnt during her first stint as an entrepreneur. First to trust herself: “The principle was very firm in my mind from the get-go: That I wanted to do personalised make up for women and I wanted the target market to be 35-plus. I wanted to do cream-based products and I wanted it to be premium.”

On the finance side the business started with two interns brainstorming and money raised from Woodall’s daughter’s godfather and a mum from the school gates who worked in the cosmetics industry. The original storyboards about product evolution or personalisation first created around the kitchen table are mirrored in the “bank of cupboards” in her home where Woodall has sheets of information to keep track of things today: “I have every figure up on the board of this business . . . month by month what we launched what the figures are and then for the current year what we’re going to be doing . . . I really like visualisation.”

I am quite long in the tooth and I’m used to the skin I’m in . . . the Instagram Trinny you see is the person I am in the office

Woodall was still experimenting with colours and making over women in her bathroom as research for her Match2Me algorithm when the money ran out. “I literally thought ‘what have I got in my house?’” says Woodall. “So I just sold all the clothes I had.”

After decades of compulsive clothes buying (her version of dry January is “no spend January”) two sales yielded about £60000.

“And I have a shitload of clothes now. You’re probably thinking ‘Jesus Christ I saw her culling’.”

Wardrobe culling is just one thing you can see Woodall do on the internet. At a Trinny London pop-up event in New York such is her draw that two women flew from Chicago to meet the woman they had first seen on Instagram using a dog nappy in lockdown to dye her eyelashes. A recent (tasteful) post had her mid bikini wax while others wrapped presents in the background.

The energetic content on her personal and corporate social media channels with millions of followers is integral to the brand’s success. And what you see is what you get: “I’m pretty consistent” says Woodall. “I am quite long in the tooth and I’m used to the skin I’m in . . . the Instagram Trinny you see is the person I am in the office.”

There are impromptu Trinny moments. But most of her output about health beauty and fashion is carefully co-ordinated and filmed on one day each week. “It’s about how you make that feel ultimately organic. And I think that takes a tremendous amount of work” says Woodall. “On social media we do a plan which is two months in advance . . . we have the stories for all the days. The amount of content we produce as a company is probably 10 times any other beauty brand’s.”

For Woodall “it’s actually daily market research”. The brand gets thousands of comments and direct messages a day. “Every day I’ll sit on the loo at lunch [and read the feedback] and I’ll do some in the morning when I wake up . . . what are they thinking? How are they feeling? It tells me so much and they know so much.”

None more so than the Trinny Tribe — dedicated fans of the brand who now number 100000 women in 16 countries; a social media network that is carefully nurtured.

So much for the doubts expressed by some potential investors in the notoriously male-dominated world of venture capital when Woodall was fundraising before being backed by Unilever Ventures.

“I remember one particular VC said ‘you’ve got the demographic totally wrong you need to be millennial otherwise it won’t work.’ And I said ‘you don’t have faith that there are women online who are the women I’m talking to. They just don’t have anything that addresses their needs right now and that’s why they’re not buying’.”

Woodall has raised just £7m in funding including a small round as pandemic panic set in and the world locked down. In fact that supercharged the business. It redeployed staff to do virtual appointments online. “We had 3000 booked in the first day . . . what I call our sleeping customer came to buy.”

Sales more than tripled to £44m in the year to March 2021. The brand has now achieved more than £100m in revenues since it launched is growing quickly and has gross margins of 60-65 per cent.

Woodall won’t talk valuation but eschews comparisons with other make-up brands such as millennials-focused Glossier. “If we were just that [make-up and beauty] as a business I’d say yes. But we won’t be just that as a business” she says.

Trinny London will next month launch in a new area with fevered online speculation suggesting it might be haircare and skincare clothes lingerie handbags or even physical stores.

Three questions for Trinny Woodall Who is your leadership hero? Chrissie Rucker the founder of The White Company. She’s a truly inspiring businesswoman. Having grown the family-owned business into a global leader and household name for all things “home” she beautifully combines leadership motherhood femininity and strength. If you were not a CEO/leader what would you be? A makeover expert or therapist. What was the first leadership lesson you learnt? That I don’t have all the answers and now have people in the team that know more than I do in an area and realise what a relief and support it actually is as opposed to giving myself a hard time that I don’t know everything!

“I knew I wanted to have five verticals” says Woodall who is already working on the third launch. “I told the VCs that . . . we’re going to launch with this but we are going to be a personalised platform for women to find what they need and get emotional support in how they get it.”

This year’s plans include a push into the US — and more hiring. Headcount doubled during the first UK lockdown and is approaching 200. As it grows Woodall is concerned about keeping everyone connected to the brand — which in effect means to her.

She spent an hour remotely with each new joiner in lockdown. When Covid allows she roams the office directed by her assistant Louise to find those she hasn’t met in person. “I do a lot of big Zoom calls but I want them to feel I really know who they are.”

It’s too early to be thinking about an exit from a business says Woodall where she still has “the majority by quite a long way”. But the prospect of a future payday is one marker for success: “It’s money to an extent because I don’t own my home and I’m 57. And I want to own my own home” says Woodall. “Then it’s about for myself that I’ve done it. That is a big motivation. I spent a long time growing into myself.”

Woodall who struggled in the stiff male environment of the City clearly relishes her young predominantly female team and her symbiotic relationship with the Trinny Tribe. “The buzz I got from what I did before [in makeovers] was shifting a woman in how she felt . . . there is nothing that gives me greater pleasure . . . having women say ‘because of Trinny London’ or ‘because of this thing I watched I feel this about myself’ . . . that is profoundly fulfilling.”

Her next development as an entrepreneur and boss “is to not be so much in the weeds because when you are bootstrapping a company for those first few years you are on every single detail.”

Still you get the impression that relinquishing control of the detail just isn’t a terribly Trinny thing to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two huge acquisitions have already taken place: Take-Two Interactive's acquisition of Zynga for $12.7 billion and Microsoft's takeover of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. These events have set the stage for a year full of exciting business deals that will bring forth new possibilities for the gaming industry.

Sony could be looking at a possible acquisition of EA

According to the Hollywood Reporter there is a chance that the Japanese company could be looking into a possible acquisition of Electronic Arts (EA). They took a major hit after Microsoft's acquisition which took off $20 billion of its market cap.

Buying out EA which has a market cap of $37 billion could be a viable business strategy for Sony to expand more into the game industry.

These megadeals may be a way for tech giants to consolidate more of the gaming industry. The Microsoft megadeal will severely boost the Xbox Game Pass which costs $10 to $15 a month making it the 'Netflix' of gaming. Additionally it could also mean a future where the Call of Duty Overwatch and Diablo series will be exclusive titles.

It's also worth speculating what Sony's actions would be which also has a rumored untitled service on the PlayStation to compete in the same vein. Their exclusive intellectual property has popular titles such as God of War Horizon Forbidden West and Spider-Man but the Microsoft Activision Blizzard merger severely increases competition.

Other options that multinational conglomerate corporation could look into

The tech giant could also look for more affordable options such as buying Ubisoft valued at $6.9 billion or Take-Two Interactive valued at $18.33 billion. The former Ubisoft has several fan-favorite franchises such as Assassin's Creed Far Cry and Watch Dogs while Take-Two is the Grand Theft Auto series publisher.

Although EA looks to be the favorite Ubisoft or Take-Two would be far cheaper options that they could buy out.

Disney could also be looking into EA as reported by Handler a research company. This would be an excellent decision to spread the legendary company's horizons.

A merger between ESPN and EA would spell innumerable possibilities for the sports industry in the age of the metaverse.

The future only holds innovation for gaming with the big tech companies making huge strides into the gaming industry. 2022 is proving to be an exciting year as fans are looking at giants such as Sony for their next move.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbW9zdC12aXN1YWxseS1zdHVubmluZy1ub24tZXhjbHVzaXZlLWdhbWVzLXJlbGVhc2luZy0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 10 Most Visually Stunning Non-Exclusive Games Releasing In 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbW9zdC12aXN1YWxseS1zdHVubmluZy1ub24tZXhjbHVzaXZlLWdhbWVzLXJlbGVhc2luZy0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JlZC1kZWFkLXJlZGVtcHRpb24tMi1ldmVyeS1ncmF2ZS1tZWFuaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Red Dead Redemption 2: Every Grave You Can Visit and The Symbolism Behind Them,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JlZC1kZWFkLXJlZGVtcHRpb24tMi1ldmVyeS1ncmF2ZS1tZWFuaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

See also “Russia’s demands challenge NATO’s threats” Workers World Jan. 5.

The corporate media’s constant use of Cold War terminology to describe the meeting of the U.S. and Russian presidents as a meeting of the “two superpowers” masks the present relationship of forces.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin met at the Group of 20 Summit on July 7 2017 in Hamburg Germany.

Old preconceptions and terms must be challenged in order to have an accurate view of the present international situation. Russia today as a capitalist country is not even a fifth-rate economic power.

The Russian economy is smaller than the economies of Brazil South Korea or Canada. According to World Bank and International Monetary Fund measurements Russia now ranks 12th globally in its gross domestic product. This measurement is the market value of goods and services.

Today’s Russian Federation is a vastly different state — socially politically economically and militarily — from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of even 27 years ago.

It is important to understand what Russia is today in order to understand the real intent of the constant Russia-baiting in the media.

In stockpiled nuclear weapons from the Cold War the U.S. and the Russian Federation may have somewhat even nuclear firepower — more than enough to incinerate the world in one launch.

But U.S. military expenditures are estimated at 36% to almost 50% of total global military expenditures. Russia’s expenditures are 4% to 5% of the global total.

The Pentagon maintains more than 800 military bases around the world and 300000 troops stationed outside the U.S. Russia has a naval base in Syria and a few communication centers in former Soviet Republics.

The U.S. Navy has 19 aircraft carriers each of which includes jet aircraft helicopters destroyers and nuclear subs. Russia has one 27-year-old carrier propelled with oil-fired boilers rather than a nuclear reactor.

Russia’s resources a target

Russia is a target of U.S. imperialism because of its vast resources. Eighty percent of Russian exports abroad are now in raw materials primarily gas and oil. The petroleum industry in Russia is one of the largest in the world. It is the largest exporter of natural gas. Coal iron aluminum precious metals lumber and cereals are other major exports.

This makes Russia’s economy especially vulnerable to global commodity swings and drastic downturns.

There is an insatiable drive to control Russia’s great wealth by the largest banks and corporations. All currents of the U.S. and Western imperialist ruling class are desperate to have unlimited access to this great stream of profits which they had finally laid their hands on just a few years ago. Remember: Imperialism’s very survival depends on expansion and profit.

Photo ops handshakes and reports of cooperation at the G20 meeting do not change or lessen U.S. imperialism’s desperation to hammer down any form of resistance to its global domination. Any country attempting independent development is immediately targeted.

There is an irresolvable contradiction between the need of the majority of countries in the world to develop their productive forces and the need of Wall Street to maintain its place at the center of the world economy. However Washington’s position is clearly slipping despite daily military threats that assert its global dominance.

New Russian capitalists

Privatization campaigns of the 1990s facilitated the transfer of significant Soviet-era wealth to a relatively small group of Russian business oligarchs. These pirates were willing to make the most corrupt deals with the West to maintain their stolen wealth.

As long as Russian politicians and privateers were totally compliant with the devastating looting of the country they were showered with glowing media coverage. The Group of 7 the largest imperialist countries invited Russia to join.

The problem for the new capitalist oligarchs is that when the Soviet state was overthrown there was no room for a new capitalist power in the global economy. All the banks and multinational corporations aggressively moved in to take advantage of the chaos.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union U.S. imperialism and the Western imperialist powers expected to have totally free rein to loot Russia at will. For almost 15 years they did have a free hand. The results in Russia were devastating.

Cost of capitalist restoration

Seumas Milne a British journalist with the Guardian News summarized Stephen F. Cohen’s book “The Failed Crusade” on this transition to a capitalist economy. Cohen is professor emeritus of Russian studies at New York University and Princeton University.

“In the most cataclysmic peacetime economic collapse of an industrial country in history . . . [u]nder the banner of reform and the guidance of American-prescribed shock therapy perestroika became catastroika.

“Capitalist restoration brought in its wake mass pauperization and unemployment wild extremes of inequality rampant crime virulent anti-Semitism and ethnic violence combined with legalized gangsterism on a heroic scale and precipitous looting of public assets. . . .

“By the late 1990s national income had fallen by more than 50%. . . . The market experiment has produced more orphans than Russia’s [20 million-plus WWII] wartime casualties while epidemics of cholera and typhus have re-emerged millions of children suffer from malnutrition and adult life expectancy has plunged.”

The 1990s was a downhill slide from “a centralized publicly owned economy to . . . robber-baron capitalism. . . .

“For developing countries in particular the destruction of the second superpower — which had championed the anti-colonial movement and later the third-world cause — largely closed off the scope for different alliances and sources of aid and sharply increased their dependence on the West.”

NGOs as Western missionaries

Into the economic chaos and social dislocation came not only Western bankers stockbrokers real estate schemers and speculators. Every major corporation including Rockefeller Ford and the Soros foundations religious groups and the U.S. Agency for International Development lavishly funded nongovernmental organizations.

These NGOs set up staffs and funded schools religious organizations and publications to promote capitalist values Western “democracy” and civil society and to glorify competition and private property. They wrote property laws and textbooks and were thoroughly enamored with Western capitalism.

The Yale Center for the Study of Globalization reported: “There are at least 600000 registered nongovernmental noncommercial organizations operating in Russia” in 2005.

Forces in the Russian Duma the elected assembly began a nationwide government campaign against foreign-funded NGOs. In 2012 USAID was kicked out of Russia. The “foreign agent” law put 33% of Russia’s NGOs out of business in 2013.

NATO expansion

The bankers’ policy was about subjugating and recolonizing not only Russia but all the countries of the former socialist bloc including the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Republics.

In order to lock this violent and chaotic transformation in place the U.S.-commanded military alliance NATO was expanded to include every East European country and former Soviet Republic right up to the borders of Russia. In 2013-14 this untenable absorption came to a crisis over U.S. and German attempts to totally seize Ukraine.

During the years of violent transition to a capitalist economy the Ukraine had still maintained deep economic ties and extensive trade with Russia but it also had increasing ties to the European Union. The EU however would not settle for sharing Ukraine with Russia. A total break was demanded by the bankers.

U.S. and EU seizure of Ukraine

When Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych was negotiating about Ukraine’s entrance into the EU the EU refused to allow Ukraine to continue trading with Russia. It demanded that Ukraine join NATO. This meant that the Crimea the home of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and only warm-water port would be handed over to NATO.

To carry out a coup against the elected Ukrainian government the Euromaidan movement led by neoliberals and fascists received enormous Western support and funding. The reactionary movement seized the center of the capital Kiev and held it for three months. U.S. and West European media and politicians poured into the encampment with unanimous support.

Despite Russian and Ukrainian government efforts to negotiate and a Russian pledge of debt cancellation and new funds the elected Ukraine government was labeled “corrupt” and overthrown by a fascist gang which seized government buildings on Feb. 22 2014.

Faced with the loss of its only warm-water port Russia took control of the small peninsula and the Russian port in Crimea.

Fearing a wave of privatizations and quick industrial shutdowns that have come with every step of capitalist restructuring the workers’ movement in Eastern Ukraine the industrial heartland seized factories and communication centers in self-defense against the fascist coup in Kiev.

The result was that Russia lost a major trading partner. Its sphere of economic relations became much smaller and it faced an all-out effort at economic ­strangulation.

Banks and sanctions

Economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and EU at this time were specifically designed to hit Russia in its energy sector where the country is most vulnerable.

Suddenly no U.S. oil company could do business with Russia nor could any companies sell drilling technology to access oil and gas reserves. The sanctions restrict access to Western financial markets. U.S. banks cannot issue long-term loans to Russian businesses for energy-focused projects.

Russian state banks are now excluded from raising long-term loans in the EU. The U.S. also put sanctions on Russian banks banning U.S. companies from receiving or loaning money to them.

All this was intended to force the new capitalists around Putin to break with his policies and to submit to a total takeover to protect their own profits.

Russia is now on the defensive and since 2014 it’s been clear that the imperialists’ plan is total dismemberment. Strengthening the state sector under Putin and tightening controls on foreign-funded NGOs and on capital flight out of the country were a matter of economic survival.

Defense of Syria

The U.S.-led effort to overturn the government in Syria threatens to take another major trading partner away from Russia. Russia’s only naval facility on the Mediterranean is in Syria.

The appeal of the Syrian government to Russia for assistance after four years of war tens of thousands of mercenaries and funded extremist forces and a year of U.S. and 10 other countries bombing Syria has now led to daily confrontations.

There is a broad agreement that if U.S. plans succeed in overturning the government in Syria following the overturns that have occurred in Iraq and Libya then Russia and Iran are undeniably next on the list.

Russia’s assistance to Syria is of a defensive character. Self-defense is a critical link in the global axis of resistance based not on ideology but necessity. Without Russian help Syria would have fallen.

But with significant Western funding for development blocked new avenues have opened. Russia is increasingly relying on China for loans is now providing 60000 tons of wheat per month to Venezuela and has canceled Cuba’s $30 billion Soviet-era debt.

The growing web of trade and economic relations among economic formations like BRICS (Brazil Russia India China and South Africa) Shanghai Cooperation Organization the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) and the Chinese One Belt One Road proposal are all signs of growing efforts among many targeted countries to fight isolation and resist imperialist dismemberment.

During discussion about global warming at the G20 meeting it was the U.S. colossus that appeared increasingly isolated.

Sole superpower status has not benefited population

Military expenditures continually drain every needed social program in the U.S. But they are extremely profitable for the largest corporations such as DynCorp International Boeing Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.

According to the World Health Organization U.S. life expectancy ranked 31st globally is one of the lowest in developed countries. It is the same for basic education; at 38th the United States ranks behind every major industrialized country.

After a flurry of acquisitions in the gaming industry investors looking to get ahead of future deals may be wondering which industry faces consolidation next. The answer could lie in movie theaters.

Decree decreased

In 1948 the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Paramount Pictures Inc. that studios cannot own theaters due to antitrust laws. However a federal judge granted The Department of Justice's motion to lift the ""Paramount Decree"" on August 7 2020 starting a two-year sunset termination period.

After the decree ends in August 2022 movie studios like Disney (DIS 2.47%) may look to enter the theatrical distribution business the quickest way possible: acquiring movie theater operators.

But why would studios acquire cineplexes when streaming is on the rise and brick-and-mortar movie exhibitors are struggling? For starters blockbusters like Spider-Man: No Way Home are still making money at the box office -- raking in $1.69 billion worldwide to date. And instead of making 55% to 60% of the gross ticket sales a studio could take the full 100%. Just 1% extra on a billion-dollar blockbuster would earn a studio an extra $10 million.

Alternatively streaming services could get creative with their subscriptions by releasing blockbusters early or including tickets as part of its value proposition. Notably Amazon.com and Netflix (NFLX 3.04%) don't have to comply with the ""Paramount Decree"" because ""they didn't exist when the decrees were signed."" In fact Netflix already purchased Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in 2020. Disney purchased the El Capitan Theatre in the 1980s but that required court proceedings at the time of purchase -- which will no longer be the case come August.

Potential targets

AMC Entertainment (AMC -0.30%) is the world's largest cinema chain owning roughly 950 theatres and its enterprise value -- deserved or not -- reflects that at roughly $16.7 billion. AMC gains some competitive advantage from its broader reach in international markets compared to its competitors with approximately a third of its theatres in Europe and the Middle East. Since most blockbusters gross more money internationally -- Spider Man: No Way Home has made roughly 57% of its box office returns outside of the U.S. -- AMC may be a more attractive target than its domestically concentrated competitors.

Outside of AMC publicly traded movie theater companies like Cinemark (CNK -4.01%) and The Marcus Corporation (MCS -5.37%) have been struggling over the past couple of years -- largely because of the pandemic.

Cinemark at a $5.1 billion enterprise value is a pure movie theater play owning 524 theatres in the U.S. and Latin America. The Marcus Corporation at a $1 billion enterprise value owns or operates 85 theatres primarily in the Midwestern United States but also owns or manages 19 hotels. Unlike AMC's ""meme stock"" rise both Cinemark and The Marcus Corporation have seen their stocks cut in nearly half since the beginning of the pandemic making both attractive to potential acquirers.

Why it might not happen

The movie theater business is in decline and the top chains carry massive debt. Cinemark's total debt has ballooned from $2 billion to $3.9 billion over the past three years. And while AMC has been able to pay down some of its nearly $11 billion total debt by issuing more than 400 million new shares over the last two fiscal years it still might be a tough pill for an acquirer to swallow.

Even before the pandemic the theater industry sold 200 million fewer domestic tickets in 2019 compared to its highs in the early oughts. While movie theaters have been raising prices for years to compensate for the drop in ticket sales there are no guarantees that moviegoers will return especially as the pandemic seemingly continues into its third year. In fact when CivicScience recently polled 60000 Americans 71% responded that they preferred watching something at home over going out to a movie.

Still as streaming grows in popularity studios covet box office sales. This year HBO Max ended same-day releases for its Warner Bros. theatrical releases creating a 45-day window of theatrical exclusivity. No example may be more telling than Paramount delaying the release of Top Gun: Maverick five times -- while reportedly refusing to sell the film to AppleTV+ and Netflix -- to see that its tentpole franchise has the opportunity to have a proper box office run.

What's next

If movie theaters are able to replicate the success of Spider Man: No Way Home in the first half of 2022 with slated blockbuster releases like The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick don't be surprised if studios like Disney or the soon-to-be Warner Bros. Discovery can't resist a larger piece of their billion-dollar franchises' pie. Watch their actions closely after the ""Paramount Decree"" sunsets in August -- or even sooner if Amazon and Netflix want to take advantage of a loophole.

As far as the most likely target Cinemark appears to be the most attractive. While Cinemark doesn't offer the market penetration of AMC its presence in Latin America could be attractive as Latin influences on Hollywood grow. And each Cinemark theatre works out to $9.7 million of the company's enterprise value -- the best and lowest per-theater value among its competitors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjkvYW1hcmluLWhhcy1hLWJpZy1kZWNpc2lvbi10by1tYWtlLWhvdy1zYXJpc3NhLWNhcGl0YWwtY2FuLWhlbHAtaXQtbW92ZS1mb3J3YXJkLmh0bWzSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wMS8yOS9hbWFyaW4taGFzLWEtYmlnLWRlY2lzaW9uLXRvLW1ha2UtaG93LXNhcmlzc2EtY2FwaXRhbC1jYW4taGVscC1pdC1tb3ZlLWZvcndhcmQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pharma company Amarin has a key asset and a big decision. How Sarissa Capital can help it move forward,"Business: Amarin engages in the development and commercialization of therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in the United States. Its lead product is Vascepa a prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid product used as an adjunct to diet for reducing triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. The company sells its products principally to wholesalers and specialty pharmacy providers. It has a collaboration with Mochida Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. to develop and commercialize drug products and indications based on the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Vascepa the omega-3 acid and eicosapentaenoic acid.

Activist Commentary: Sarissa Capital Management is an activist investor focused on the health-care sector. It was founded in May 2013 by Alex Denner former senior managing director of Icahn Capital. Denner was the lead in Icahn's investments in companies like Biogen Amylin Genzyme MedImmune and ImClone and has sat on the boards of ImClone Amylin Biogen Enzon and Adventrx Pharmaceuticals. Denner has a doctoral degree in biotech. He also has a rare combination of analytical skills in this sector activist skills and experience. Sarissa has been involved with multiple health-care companies that have been acquired. Most notably there is The Medicines Company which was acquired by Novartis International AG giving Sarissa a 138.43% 13D return versus 16.40% for the S&P 500 over the same period. There is also Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. which was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical giving Sarissa a 529.39% 13D return versus 32.47% for the S&P 500 over the same period.

Amarin's lead product is Vascepa a prescription cholesterol-lowering heart medication. The Vascepa brand is extremely valuable as it is a drug that has been proven to work already has approval by the U.S. FDA and the European Union and helps to tackle the No. 1 cause of death globally making this the largest drug category globally. However in March 2020 the company lost its patents to Vascepa in the U.S. This news tanked the stock from $13.58 to $4.00 in the matter of a day and after closing as high as $24.12 per share as recently as Dec. 13 2019. In June 2021 the Supreme Court rejected the company's bid to revive the Vascepa patents ruling in favor of two generic manufacturers of the drug. The company is involved in ongoing litigation related to the patent infringement suit. The company's latest announced plan is that they are going to compete with the generics and launch the drug in Europe and accelerate growth in the U.S.

As a result of the court ruling the company scaled back the launch of Vascepa in the United States and reduced the size of its sales force. Despite this and even with generic competition it has still been able to achieve $600 million of revenue in the U.S. This revenue should decrease over the next few years as generic competition increases but the drug is not easy to manufacture due to its specialized formula and supply constraint. Further Vascepa is still a good brand so the company should be able to compete in the United States and grow that revenue back with a fuller sales team. As an example even though Lipitor's patent expired in 2011 it still generates approximately $2 billion in U.S. revenue a year for Pfizer. Moreover the company does have patent protection from generics in the EU so they can launch there with no generic competition and should be able to generate significant revenue outside of the United States. However the company's present plan would require spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a European sales team in addition to the U.S. sales team.

There are clearly more efficient ways to monetize this asset. The easiest thing for the company to do would be to sell itself to a strategic investor that already has a full sales infrastructure and team around the world. This is what The Medicines Company also with a cholesterol-lowering drug did just seven months after Sarissa filed a 13D there. The Medicines Company was acquired by Novartis for $9.7 billion despite having no revenue (versus $600 million for Amarin) and no FDA approval at the time (Amarin has FDA and EU approval). Amarin has a star drug and would be a prime takeover target for Big Pharma.

The second-best option for Amarin would be to partner with another company that could distribute the drug. This way Amarin does not have to spend money on a sales team and infrastructure. Instead it would just collect royalties similar to Innoviva where Sarissa has a 13D filing and board seats.

The last resort for the company would be to build out the sales forces in Europe and the U.S. and distribute the drug itself. This would be an incredibly expensive time consuming and risky option to be avoided at all costs.

Clearly a deal like the Novartis/MDCO acquisition would be a no-brainer here. Absent that partnering with a company that has a dedicated international sales force could quickly optimize Vascepa to billions of dollars of sales without having to spend much of the $470 million of net cash on Amarin's balance sheet.

In any event Sarissa has extensive knowledge and deep contacts in the industry. It would be a valuable resource to help the company analyze and pursue any path it chooses. As implied by the company's stock price shareholders are frustrated and a shareholder representative with the industry experience of Sarissa would be well received. However if the company resists it will be interesting to see how a proxy fight would play out for Sarissa. Amarin is incorporated in England and Wales and its principal offices are in Ireland. They have unusual provisions including that at every annual general meeting at least one-third of the directors shall retire from office. However retiring directors are eligible for re-election so despite this provision as of the last annual meeting all seven directors had been on the board for at least seven years – with a majority on for at least 11 years. Moreover the company only puts up two directors per year so it would take at least two years for Sarissa to get significant board representation if this turns confrontational.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor an institutional research service on shareholder activism and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments. Amarin is owned in the fund.",,,,,,

Some Tesla customers are frustrated after reserving a Cybertruck order for $100 over two years ago.

They told Insider they haven't heard anything from Tesla about delivery dates since they paid.

Some customers said they're prepared to wait for Cybertruck but one said he's cancelled his refund.

Elon Musk unveiled Tesla's first electric pickup truck in November 2019 and orders started piling up.

Three days after the reveal the CEO tweeted that Tesla had received 200000 orders for its Cybertruck.

More than two years later early-bird customers who reserved a Cybertruck for $100 in 2019 are still waiting to get their hands on Tesla's new electric vehicle.

Five people who forked out $100 to secure their Cybertruck order told Insider that they're feeling frustrated about the two-year wait especially because they haven't had any updates from Tesla's customer service team.

Some said it was worth the wait others requested refunds. They sent Insider email confirmations of their Cybertruck order payments made between 2019 and 2020.

Wayne Matus based in New Jersey told Insider that he made his reservation on the day of the Cybertruck's unveiling in 2019. He said he was patiently hanging on but was ""amazed"" that he hadn't received an email or phone call from a Tesla representative with more information.

""I am frustrated that Tesla has not contacted me as a customer"" Matus said. ""I am not sure how much longer I can wait.""

Meanwhile David Deschene has also been waiting nearly two years for his Cybertruck he told Insider.

Deschene said he's ""rather disappointed"" with the release date changes which he saw as ""missed opportunities"" because he could have traded his petrol truck in for other trucks that were released before Cybertruck such as Ford's F-150 Lightning.

But he said he was prepared to wait until the truck is ready.

""The futuristic style alone is intriguing enough to bide my time"" Deschene said.

Other customers thought differently about the long wait times.







In west Texas Benjamin Cost decided to request a refund after waiting more than 18 months for Cybertruck and hearing nothing from Tesla he told Insider.

Musk first predicted that production of the futuristic pickup truck made of heavy-duty stainless steel and armored glass would kick off in 2021 — that date soon got pushed back to 2022.

Now the automaker has delayed production to ""hopefully"" next year Musk said in Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The pushback was because Tesla was changing the Cybertruck's features and components a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on January 14.

Athan Poulos based in California paid a $100 deposit for the Cybertruck reservation in January 2020. He showed Insider documentation relating to this. He expected the Cybertruck to be delivered in late 2021 or early 2022.

Poulos said he was ""slightly frustrated"" but felt it was worth waiting for if the electric pickup truck lives up to the hype.

""If Tesla is using these additional months to develop a superior truck then yes I do think it's worth the wait"" he said.

Musk said in early December that the six-passenger Cybertruck will come with four motors and be able to ""drive diagonally like a crab.""

Tesla said during the truck's unveiling that the single- dual- and tri-motor variants of the Cybertruck would cost $39990 $49990 and $69990 respectively but the price for the four-motor variant is unknown.

Mark Mamedly who placed his reservation back in December 2019 told Insider that he's not been contacted by Tesla customer service for updates on the Cybertruck. He also said he's frustrated but thinks he can wait a little longer.

Some of Elon Musk's companies are known to keep some customers waiting for months without customer service. Insider recently reported that SpaceX's Starlink has left some customers waiting almost a year for the internet network.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU2Mzk5Ni90ZXNsYS1iZWF0cy1jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLXNvZnR3YXJlL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU2Mzk5Ni90ZXNsYS1iZWF0cy1jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLXNvZnR3YXJlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Vs Chip Shortage: In-House Strategies Come To The Rescue,"The auto industry has been in panic mode for months—a shortage of computer chips forced some automakers to suspend production for extended periods leading to empty dealer lots and skyrocketing prices. But one company seemed to sidestep the whole crisis—Tesla has been breaking records quarter after quarter and sold nearly twice as many vehicles in 2021 as it did in 2020.

What’s the secret? Tesla and its usually voluble CEO have said little about “how the carmaker ran circles around the rest of the auto industry” as the New York Times put it. However it’s becoming clear that Tesla’s unified computing architecture and control over its software was at the very least a major factor.

Like every other automaker Tesla wasn’t able to get the chips it had ordered in sufficient quantities. Unlike them however it was able to rewrite its software in order to take advantage of the chips that were available. “We have used alternative parts and programmed software to mitigate the challenges caused by these shortages” the company said in its earnings report.

The legacy automakers didn’t have that option because their computing software and hardware are under the control of suppliers. The Times reports that in many cases automakers also relied on these suppliers to deal with chip manufacturers so they lacked the leverage to bargain with the chipsters.

Above: A look at Tesla's FSD computer (Source: Above: A look at Tesla's FSD computer (Source: Tesla

“Tesla born in Silicon Valley never outsourced their software—they write their own code” Morris Cohen a Pprofessor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania told the Times. “They rewrote the software so they could replace chips in short supply with chips not in short supply. The other carmakers were not able to do that. Tesla controlled its destiny.”

Tesla’s unified computing architecture hasn’t gotten as many headlines as its 0-60 times and handy features like Dog Mode and Fart Mode but it’s been a considerable competitive advantage since the company’s early days as co-founder Ian Wright explained to me in a 2014 interview (see Chapter 9 of my book Tesla: How Elon Musk and Company Made Electric Cars Cool and Remade the Automotive and Energy Industries).

Now seven years later legacy automakers are realizing that they need to take yet another page from Tesla’s book and take control of their vehicles’ computer systems. The Times reports that Mercedes plans to use fewer specialized chips and more standardized semiconductors in its upcoming models and to write its own software. In the future Mercedes will “make sure we have customized standardized chips in the car” Board Member Markus Schäfer told the Times. “Not one thousand different chips.”

“Probably some others were earlier going down this road” Mr. Schäfer added.

Or follow us on Google News

Tesla makes a habit of defying conventional wisdom. For instance conventional wisdom in the auto manufacturing business says you can’t make money building electric cars. The cost of batteries is too high. The cost of creating software to control cars that are essentially computers on wheels is too high. And besides only effete snobs will buy them. There’s no way to sell enough of them for the economies of scale that drive down costs to kick in.

The proof that conventional wisdom is wrong is contained in the year-end financial report Tesla released last week. According to Zach Kirkhorn Tesla’s chief financial officer (CFO) “For Q4 specifically automotive gross margin excluding credits increased to 29.2% which is our highest yet. We do expect to continue to see stronger operating margins as we grow our volumes and improve operating leverage. Over a longer term horizon we are quite optimistic about the expansion of margins. From the hardware side we are aggressively driving manufacturing innovations and operational efficiency to reduce cost.”

Tesla Cost Per Vehicle Is $36000

InsideEVs dug into the year-end report and found this fascinating nugget. Tesla says its cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle in Q3 and again in Q4 was $36000. COGS includes all costs and expenses directly related to the production of a product. It excludes things like overhead and sales and marketing. Since Tesla doesn’t advertise like traditional auto manufacturers do so it obviously saves lots of money there as well. Tesla says “We believe our current projects including large castings structural battery pack 4680 cells and many others should help us continue to minimize our product cost.”

Keep in mind that the least expensive Tesla the Model 3 starts at around $45000 and the Model Y lists for almost $60000. It quickly becomes apparent that with a COGS of $36000 Tesla is one of the most profitable car companies in the world. So much for the “you can’t make money building electric cars” trope we have been hearing constantly for the past 10 years. Once again conventional wisdom is not all it’s cracked up to be.

Do you know how much each Tesla cars cost to produce? The average cost to make a Tesla electric car is an impressive $36000. The US-based electric car major sells its cheapest car which is the Tesla Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive at a starting price of $44990.

Among others the Tesla Model Y price starts at around $60000 while the refreshed Tesla Model S and X prices start at $95000 and $105000 respectively. In fact no other Tesla cars currently sell at a price point below $50000 while the average manufacturing cost for all the Tesla vehicles presently is $36000 per unit.

Tesla shared this information while revealing its cost per vehicle in the third quarter of 2021. The EV manufacturer aims to reduce the per-unit vehicle cost production further with the new battery technology that it is developing. Also the structural battery pack 4680 battery cells large castings are also likely to reduce Tesla's future per unit vehicle production cost. Another major cost-saving measure adopted by the EV manufacturer is that it doesn't spend money on advertising like other traditional OEMs.

""We believe our current projects including large castings structural battery pack 4680 cells and many others should help us continue to minimize our product cost"" Tesla has said. Clearly Tesla is currently one of the most profit-making car brands in the world and it is aiming to increase the ratio further by reducing vehicle production costs.

In the initial days of the company sceptics argued that Tesla could never be profitable as they said electric vehicles are structurally unprofitable because of highly expensive batteries and other reasons. In fact this is one of the reasons why traditional automakers have been sceptical about EV adoption.

How Tesla remained confident that innovations in manufacturing paired with purpose-built vehicles and factories could be a viable solution to the EV production expense problem. As it appears Tesla's strategy is perfectly working and inspiring other car brands as well.

LOCKHART Texas — Deep in the ground in a basement in Lockhart you'll find Ben and Jenn Hodges.

They bought Fiddler's Green Music Shop in February 2020. However when COVID-19 hit just a couple of weeks later they were forced to close their doors.

""It was kind of like this emotional roller coaster"" said Jenn Hodges.

They were excited to finally own their first business – a dream that quickly vanished. The Hodges tried to apply for financial relief through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan but because they recently purchased the business they didn't qualify.

""I had to lay everybody off"" said Ben Hodges. ""It was a pretty rough time.""

The Hodges had to let go of the two employees they had left.

Eventually they decided it'd be best to pack up their things in Austin and move the business to Lockhart.

""All the instruments were down here in a big pile in all their cases"" said Jenn. ""I got power tools and ladders and kind of converted the space together into what it is now.""

Despite being miles away customers don't think twice when making the drive.

""We get so many people to drive down from Austin San Antonio even from Houston and Dallas"" said Ben Hodges.

It's been a great year for them. Sales are up and the only thing holding them back is limited stock.

""The state of current affairs is just getting inventory because of the supply issues that we're seeing"" said Jenn Hodges.

They've been out of the least expensive instruments: beginners items mostly. Ben Hodges told KVUE that before the pandemic they'd get their instruments within a week. Now it's taking months.

However they remain hopeful the situation resolves itself soon. And Ben Hodges told KVUE he is grateful for how far they've come.

""I l love my job"" said Ben Hodges. ""I'm glad to be in Lockhart. I love this town.""

Most people have seen classic horror films like Psycho (1960) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991). But what many may not know is that the terrifying villains in these three movies were all based on one real-life killer: Ed Gein the so-called “Butcher of Plainfield.”

When police entered his Plainfield Wisconsin home in November 1957 following the disappearance of a local woman they walked straight into a house of horrors. Not only did they find the woman they were looking for — dead decapitated and hung from her ankles — but they also found a number of shocking grisly objects crafted by Ed Gein.

Police found skulls human organs and gruesome pieces of furniture like lampshades made of human faces and chairs upholstered with human skin. Gein’s goal as he later explained to police was to create a skin suit to quasi-resurrect his dead mother with whom he’d been obsessed for years.

Ed Gein’s Early Life And His First Murder

Born Edward Theodore Gein on August 27 1906 in La Crosse Wisconsin Ed came of age under the influence of his religious and domineering mother Augusta. She raised Ed and his brother Henry to believe that the world was full of evil that women were “vessels of sin” and that drinking and immortality were the instruments of the devil.

Frantic to protect her family from the evil which she believed lurked around every corner Augusta insisted that they move from La Crosse — a “sinkhole of filth” she thought — to Plainfield. Even there Augusta had the family settle outside of town since she believed that living in town would corrupt her two young sons.

As a result Ed Gein only ever left his family’s isolated farmhouse to go to school. But he failed to establish any meaningful connections with his classmates who remembered him as socially awkward and prone to odd unexplained fits of laughter. What’s more Ed’s lazy eye and speech impediment made him an easy victim of bullies.

Despite all this Ed adored his mother. (His father a timid alcoholic who died in 1940 cast a much smaller shadow over his life.) He absorbed her lessons about the world and seemed to embrace her harsh worldview. Though Henry sometimes stood up to Augusta Ed never did.

So it’s perhaps not a surprise that Ed Gein’s first victim was likely his older brother Henry.

In 1944 Ed and Henry set out to clear some vegetation in their fields by burning it away. But only one of the brothers would live through the night.

As they worked their fire suddenly got out of control. And when firefighters arrived to put out the blaze Ed told them that Henry had vanished. His body was found soon afterward face down in the marsh dead from asphyxiation.

At the time it seemed like a tragic accident. But accidental or not Henry’s death meant that Ed Gein and Augusta had the farmhouse to themselves. They lived there in isolation for about a year until Augusta’s death in 1945.

Then Ed Gein began his decade-long descent into depravity.

The Horrific Crimes Of The “Butcher Of Plainfield”

Following Augusta’s death Ed Gein transformed the house into something of a shrine to her memory. He boarded up rooms that she’d used keeping them in pristine condition and moved into a small bedroom off the kitchen.

Living alone far from town he began to sink into his obsessions. Ed filled his days by learning about Nazi medical experiments studying human anatomy consuming porn — though he never attempted to date any real-life women — and reading horror novels. He also began to indulge his sick fantasies but it took a long time for anyone to realize it.

Indeed for a full decade no one thought much about the Gein farm outside of town. Everything changed in November 1957 when a local hardware store owner named Bernice Worden vanished leaving nothing behind but bloodstains.

Worden a 58-year-old widow had last been seen at her store. Her last customer? None other than Ed Gein who’d gone into the store to buy a gallon of antifreeze.

Police went to Ed’s farmhouse to investigate — and found themselves in the middle of a waking nightmare. There authorities found what would later inspire horror movies such as Silence of the Lambs Psycho and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

What Investigators Found Inside Ed Gein’s House

As soon as investigators stepped into Ed Gein’s house they found Bernice Worden in the kitchen. She was dead decapitated and hung by her ankles from the rafters.

There were also countless bones both whole and fragmented skulls impaled on his bedposts and bowls and kitchen utensils made from skulls. Worse than the bones however were the household items that Ed had made from human skin.

Authorities found chairs upholstered in human skin a wastebasket made of skin leggings made from human leg skin masks made from faces a belt made of nipples a pair of lips being used as a window shade drawstring a corset made of a female torso and a lampshade made from a human face.

Along with the skin items police found various dismembered body parts including fingernails four noses and the genitals of nine different women. They also found the remains of Mary Hogan a tavern keeper who’d gone missing in 1954.

Ed Gein readily admitted that he’d collected most of the remains from three local graveyards which he’d started to visit two years after Augusta’s death. He told police he’d gone to the graveyards in a daze looking for bodies that he thought resembled his mother.

Ed also explained why. He told authorities that he had wanted to create a “woman suit” so that he could “become” his mother and crawl into her skin.

How Many People Did Ed Gein Kill?

Following the police visit to Ed Gein’s house the “Butcher of Plainfield” was arrested. He was found not guilty by reasons of insanity in 1957 and sent to the Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Then his farmhouse mysteriously burned to the ground.

Ten years later Ed was deemed fit to stand trial and was convicted of the murder of Bernice Worden — but just of Bernice Worden. He was never tried for Mary Hogan’s murder because the state allegedly saw it as a waste of money. Ed was insane they reasoned — he would spend the rest of his life in hospitals either way.

But that raises a chilling question. How many people did Ed Gein kill? Until his death in 1984 at the age of 77 he only ever admitted to murdering Worden and Hogan. The other bodies — and police found as many as 40 in his home — he claimed he’d robbed from graves.

As such we may never know how many people fell victim to the Butcher of Plainfield. But it is certain that Ed Gein stands as one of history’s most disturbing serial killers. He’s also seen as the inspiration for the mother-loving Norman Bates of Psycho The Texas Chain Saw Massacre‘s skin-wearing Leatherface and The Silence of The Lamb‘s Buffalo Bill.

Those movies have terrified generations of movie audiences. But they aren’t quite as chilling as the real-life story of Ed Gein himself.

Marine Corps of the US Army is looking for a new armored vehicle to replace the LAV-25.

The Cottonmouth vehicle was developed by Textron to cover the US needs. The prototype was revealed in 2021 and will compete against other vehicles in the selection program of the next reconnaissance vehicle of the US.

Cottonmouth's prototype featured a turret with a 12.7mm heavy machine gun and a Javelin anti-tank guided missile launcher.

As a reconnaissance vehicle Cottonmouth has advanced systems and surveillance sensors. Its main role is to watch its nearby area spot targets and attack them if it's needed.

The new vehicle is fully amphibious and that means that it can literally get out of its transport ship and sail to the nearest coach!

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

LANETT — Some dirt has been hauled in and some grading is taking place on the Lanett Mill site to head off a potential erosion problem.

Chris Busby of the Chambers County Development Authority (CCDA) said the work is routine maintenance to keep the problem from worsening. There is a culvert that cuts across the site not far from Tractor Supply. An extra layer of compacted soil between Tractor Supply and the culvert could keep this potential problem from damaging the water flow off the site.

The CCDA is continually marketing the 25-acre mill site for future development. The new Tractor Supply store opened on the site a couple of years ago. On the opposite end of the site is the AMEA/City of Lanett Solar Research Project a cooperative effort on the part of the Alabama Municipal Electric Authority and its member entities to generate solar energy that goes on the power grid.

The mill’s water tower and the nickel bus station have remained on the site as icons of the area’s textile heritage. Before Highway 29 was four-laned in the late 1940s the CV railway ran in front of Lanett Mill. A train station was built for mill workers to be sheltered on rainy days while they waited for a passenger train to take them closer to their home. At one time the CV rain two battery-powered cars that could carry more than 50 passengers at a time. People called them nickel buses because it cost a nickel to ride. In those days one could ride a train from West Point to River View for five cents.

Something that could help develop the mill site is for the city to get a Brownfields grant to clean up the broken brick concrete and rotten wood that’s been pushed to the back of the site.

“We are working with the city to apply for a grant” Busby said. “Our goal is to have this hauled to a landfill.”

This City of Valley has had several successful Brownfield projects to clean up mill sites in the city. Brownfield grants helped with cleanups at Riverdale Langdale and Fairfax mills.

Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the Brownfields program provides grants and technical assistance to communities and states to assess safely clean up and sustainably reuse properties that may have been contaminated in some way.

“We would have to test everything to see if there is any hazardous material in the debris that’s still there” Busby said. “If not the material could be taken to a nearby landfill. If there is some such material there it will have to go to a special kind of landfill like the one in Salem.”

Debris on some mill sites has been known to have minute amounts of asbestos and petroleum remnants.

The Brownfields program has been very successful in cleaning up abandoned sites and returning them to a new productive use. In the last 15 years an annual average of more than 35000 sites are enrolled in a cleanup effort. Since 2006 more than 200000 sites have been cleaned up in the U.S. and more than 3.3 million acres readied for reuse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcGJyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDEvcmFtb24tZGUtbGltYS13aW5zLXBlbmRsZXRvbi13aGlza3ktdmVsb2NpdHktdG91ci1ldmVudC1pbi1ncmFuZC1yYXBpZHMtbWljaGlnYW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lima wins Pendleton Whisky Velocity Tour event in Grand Rapids Michigan,"GRAND RAPIDS Mich. – As the only rider to be perfect inside Van Andel Arena Ramon de Lima (Rio Branco Brazil) won the PBR (Professional Bull Riders) Pendleton Whisky Velocity Tour’s Tractor Supply Co.

Lowe’s is teaming up with Petco to offer pet departments within its stores betting that customers want cans of dog food along with their cans of paint.

The first Lowe’s with a Petco is expected to open in February in Alamo Ranch Texas. Fourteen additional Lowe’s locations in Texas North Carolina and South Carolina will get Petco centers by the end of March the company said.

The Petco mini stores will offer food as well as pet services including vaccination clinics. Mobile grooming services will also be offered.

The is the first store-within-a-store pairing for both Lowe’s and San Diego-based Petco. Petco operates more than 1500 stores in the U.S. Mexico and Puerto Rico. Lowe’s has 2200 stores in the U.S. and Canada.

Mooresville North Carolina-based Lowe’s noted that more than 11 million new pets entered U.S. homes since the start of the COVID pandemic. The company said it makes sense to serve both.

“For many of our customers their pets and their homes top the list of things that matter most especially after two years spent mostly together within the same four walls” said Bill Boltz Lowe’s executive vice president of merchandising.

The move could set Lowe’s apart from rival Home Depot which doesn’t sell pet food and help it compete with stores like Menards and Tractor Supply which also sell pet food and home improvement products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMucGVubmxpdmUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcGVubmxpdmUvbmFtZS9kYWxlLWpvbmVzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyNTk5Mjk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dale Jones Obituary (1942 - 2022) - York Springs PA - Patriot-News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.pennlive.com/us/obituaries/pennlive/name/dale-jones-obituary?id=32599297 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMucGVubmxpdmUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcGVubmxpdmUvbmFtZS9kYWxlLWpvbmVzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyNTk5Mjk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

While U.S. officials say the move is needed to better align visa prices with what it costs to provide them critics worry that if the administration does not address visa wait times the cost increase could mean even fewer travelers and students coming to the United States.

According to a Federal Register notice the State Department expects the new prices to go into effect by September and it is accepting comments on the proposed increases until February 28.

“All of the fee increases are happening at a time when tourism and travel to the United States is already at an all-time low and the State Department is imposing waits of six months to a year in many places for a tourist- or business-travel visa” David Bier an immigration policy expert at the Cato Institute told VOA.

State Department figures show the visas with the highest numbers of applications are tourism business and study.

A nonimmigrant visa allows the holder to travel as a tourist or live work or study temporarily in the U.S. under certain conditions. Visa applications for tourism B1 and B2 and student visas F M J will increase from $160 to $245 a 54% increase. While employment-based visas H L O P Q and R are going from $190 to $310 a 63% increase.

“The most important thing is whether visas are issued promptly. If the administration increases costs but there’s not a vast improvement in service from the State Department then the result will be far fewer travelers” Bier added.

U.S. airport traffic has fallen in recent years counting both domestic and international travelers. According to the Transportation Security Administration it screened a total of 1.1 million people on January 26. On the same date in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic that number was more than 2 million.

Promises

Addressing America’s immigration system was one of President Joe Biden’s key campaign promises. On his first day in office he unveiled the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 sweeping immigration reform legislation that included an eight-year path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. a plan to clear employment-based visa backlogs and a plan to prevent dependents of employment-based visa holders from “aging out” of the system among other changes.

But the legislation stalled in Congress and is largely viewed as all but dead.

“Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic — as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act” Biden said.

Immigration experts say that while Biden reversed many of his predecessor's policies often described as anti-immigration a Trump administration executive order that limited legal immigration and the issuance of temporary work visas contributed to longer wait times for nonimmigrant visas.

Also the State Department temporarily suspended routine visa services at all U.S. embassies and consulates in 2020 because of COVID-19 restrictions. They are reopening under a phased resumption of visa services but about a fourth are partly or fully closed according to the Cato Institute.

U.S. consulates around the world are a major component of the immigration system processing visas ""that authorize travel to the United States but many consulates remain closed and the open ones are reporting record wait times — [more than one year] in dozens of locations” Bier wrote in a recent analysis.

A State Department official told VOA that U.S. embassies and consulates have online information on operating status and which services are currently offered.

According to Bier in January most consulates reported waits of 202 days for a visa appointment for business travelers and tourists up from 95 days in April 2021. For students and exchange visitors the wait was about 38 days up from 25 days about a year ago and 62 days for everyone else including skilled temporary workers up from 40 days in April 2021.

Effect on students workers

A State spokesperson explained that the department’s consular operations are largely funded by fees for services and the proposed fee increase is to ensure the agency is fully recovering the costs of providing these services.

“Visa fees charged by the Department are generally based on the cost of providing visa services and are determined after conducting a study of the cost of such service” the spokesperson told VOA by email. “The assessment of the actual cost of service in combination with demand projections over many years determined the fees published in the proposed fee schedule.”

Increased fees need to translate into better service especially shorter wait times which is particularly important for students said Jill Welch senior policy adviser to the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.

“We're still evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on international student flows to the United States. … It's important for [the State Department] to have adequate resources to process visa applications particularly for those students and scholars who are on tight timelines for obtaining their visas in order to arrive on time for the academic term” Welch said.

International students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed nearly $41 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 458290 jobs in the 2018-19 academic year according to a study by NAFSA: Association of International Educators. In the 2020-21 academic year international students contributed $28.4 billion to the U.S. economy a decline of nearly 27% or $10.3 billion largely because of the pandemic.

But not everyone believes higher visa costs will have a big impact.

Marcelo Barros an international student career expert in Washington told VOA that although the fee increase was “unfortunate” it wouldn't stop people from coming to the U.S.

“This is not going to have any meaningful impact on [student] enrollment or on [employment-based visas]. This will not have any meaningful impact on the desire of companies to hire talent outside the U.S.” he said adding that if travelers students or high-skill workers want to come to the United States they will pay the new fee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvamFuLzI5L2piLWJydW5zLWhhZC1iaWctcm9sZS1pbi1lYXJseS1qZWZmZXJzb24tY2l0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,J.B. Bruns had big role in early Jefferson City shoe production,"



One of Jefferson City's most successful business locations was the southwest corner of Broadway at West Main Street.

In addition to being across the street from the statehouse and state armory the corner was the major intersection for travelers coming into town from the west or headed home that way.

A brick saloon and grocery store sat on the corner beside three small homes in 1885. By 1900 John B. Bruns had moved his dry goods business started about 1873 from the middle of the block at 208 Broadway to this prominent corner where he built a larger building to house his dry goods groceries and agricultural implements plus a saloon. He built a home beside it.

Bruns immigrated to St. Louis in 1866 from Hanover where he had been trained in making wooden shoes. He found work in the brickyards to supplement his income from shoe-making. He briefly lived in Taos after in 1869 marrying Mary Yunck a widow with a sizable farm which he sold so they could move to Jefferson City. He continued to make wooden shoes and work seasonally on odd jobs.

The couple bought their first lot on Broadway in 1873 and opened a small dry goods and grocery store in their three-room home which she ran while John Bruns served as city street commissioner. They expanded in 1880 the same year he was elected to the first of two terms as county treasurer.

Bruns partnered in 1890 to form the Jefferson City Brick Company with Jacob Tanner Charles Opel and Judge Philipp Ott. In the community Bruns was a charter member of the local branch Catholic Knights of America organized in 1882 and he served on the 1884 St. Peter Cemetery Committee the St. Peter Church building committee and the St. John's Orphan Society.

In 1894 he and others -- Lidia and Charles Pearce J.H. Bruns and M.C. McGinnes -- organized the J.B. Bruns Shoe Company which took advantage of the inmate labor at the Missouri State Penitentiary. The prison at the time held 2100 inmates on 20 acres with 19 large stone and brick buildings enclosed by a stone wall.

The warden J.L. Pace contracted with the companies. The contracting companies paid the prison $11 per month plus 50-cents-per-day-per-convict. At that time the other prison contractors were J.S. Sullivan Saddle Tree company Giesecke Boot and Shoe Company Jefferson Shoe Company Standard Shoe Company A. Priesmeyer Elston Clothing Manufacturing and Jacob Straus Saddlery Company.

Jefferson City in 1900 led all Missouri cities in manufacturing with $5.5 million worth of products and employing nearly 1600 workers. And the city of about 10000 was the second largest producer of footwear west of the Allegheny mountains.

As early as 1902 he was entertaining a move outside the prison even to a new town including Sedalia Moberly and Springfield. His was the second-largest factory in the prison at the time employing 300 inmates and producing 1500 pairs of shoes daily.

""The Bruns factory would be a big thing to any city that would be so fortunate as to secure it"" the Sedalia Democrat said.

Strangely the MSP bought the inmates' shoes from a Kansas City firm despite the many shoes of the same quality being made within its walls.

In 1905 Bruns was among the first three shops to move outside the Missouri State Prison. Bruns and Giesecke-D'Oench-Hays Shoe Company left because they could not reach an agreement to raise convict wages.

Bruns' son J.H. Bruns was president of the company and president of the Jefferson City Chamber of Commerce at this pivotal economic time. J.H. Bruns had opened his own grocery and dry goods store at 701 W. Main St.

""J.H. Bruns led the chamber to make its first investments to attract and retain industry"" the News Tribune reported. The chamber bought two farms (around where Washington Park is today) which were subdivided into lots and the lots were then sold to fund construction of three shoe factories.

Bruns built a four-story 50-feet-by-200-feet factory with electric- powered machinery and its own separate power plant at 627 W. McCarty St. which still stands.

The Courtney Shoe Company of St. Louis acquired the J.B. Bruns Shoe Company in 1907. That shop was sold in 1911 to Roberts Johnson and Rand Shoe company of St. Louis which had 12 such plants. The latter company later became part of International Shoe Company which also bought the second shoe factory at 1101 E. Capitol Ave. The McCarty Street locations stopped making shoes in 1930 due to the Great Depression.

John Bruns continued to live at 200 Broadway. The store changed hands about 1920 to carry stone and agriculture products and by 1939 it was a restaurant. Next door at 202 Broadway the Capital Machine Company still in business today on Industrial Drive opened its original shop in 1933.

Michelle Brooks is a former reporter for the Jefferson City News Tribune and the author of three books on local history including ""Lost Jefferson City"" which releases Feb. 21.

It's hard to imagine though that anyone on the recruiting lists had a better senior year than the Stephenville wide receiver.

Eakin caught 93 passes for 2140 yards and 31 touchdowns leading the Yellowjackets to the Class 4A Division I state championship with a 16-0 record. Stephenville capped the perfect season with a 38-21 title-game victory over Austin LBJ during which Eakin caught nine passes for 187 yards and three touchdowns ran for a TD and caused a fumble that led directly to another.

Late Saturday Eakin announced he's committed to Texas Tech. The 6-foot-3 190-pound senior can make his pledge official during the national signing period that begins Wednesday.

Eakin has gotten scholarship offers from 15 mostly smaller programs. But Washington State via offensive coordinator Eric Morris offered him a scholarship right after Christmas and TCU and Tech did so in the past week.

A bunch of non-power-five schools in the Lone Star state were hoping Eakin would slip to them. Abilene Christian Incarnate Word North Texas Sam Houston State Tarleton State Texas A&M-Commerce and Texas State were among his suitors.

In addition to his pass-catching prowess Eakin rushed for 213 yards and four touchdowns. He finished the season with 2662 all-purpose yards.

The Red Raiders signed 16 recruits during the December early signing period.

Tech hosted a junior day on Saturday and Burleson Centennial safety Chapman Lewis subsequently announced his commitment to the Red Raiders.

Lewis 6-1 and 170 pounds helped his team go 5-7 this season and reach the area round of the Class 5A Division I playoffs where the Spartans lost to Amarillo Tascosa. He is the seventh high-school junior to commit to Tech for the 2023 class.

Lewis was named co-defensive player of the year on the all-Johnson County team published by the Cleburne Times-Review. He was credited with 138 tackles including 116 solo stops and 12 tackles for loss. He had two interceptions.

""About midway through the year we started calling ‘Chap’ our ‘eraser’” Centennial coach Kyle Geller told the Times-Review. ""Things could go bad up in front of him and he just comes down and erases things. He’s that kind of guy. We really ended up designing our entire defense around him so he’s freed up to go make plays. When we did that we became much much better as a defense.

""To me he’s the all-around player: He has good ball skills he can cover people and he’ll come up and hit you and tackle well. As a safety if you have those three qualities that’s pretty hard to beat. Not to mention that he’s extremely intelligent. People talk about football IQ and he has that.""

Tech was the first school to offer Lewis a scholarship according to recruiting services.

He made first-team all-District 4-5A Division I as a sophomore at the end of the 2020 season. At the time Geller told the Cleburne Times-Review that Lewis was ""going to be one of the best to come through here.""

""I wouldn’t say that about every kid"" Geller said ""but Chapman has my trust 100 percent. If I said that about some kids in the past they might let that get to their head and maybe not work as hard or think they’re above others. That’s not Chap. I could say those things about Chap and it won’t make a difference about him. That’s the best thing about Chapman Lewis.”

Global trade has been rocked by seismic changes to supply chains and subdued economic outputs over the course of the Covid pandemic; but increased innovation and digitalization of trade finance has ensured that businesses can still operate and provide a more sustainable future with greater transparency which bodes well for a new trade finance ecosystem.

Trade finance is playing an increasingly crucial role in supporting companies’ efforts in meeting environmental social and governance (ESG) targets and opportunities be it from paperless processes or green financing; and these are being enabled by the digital efforts of both banks and technology companies.

According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) the global trade finance gap hit an all-time high of $1.7 trillion due to Covid—with small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) hardest hit accounting for 40% of rejected trade finance requests. ADB highlights the role of digitalization in streamlining onboarding processes for SMEs and opening new sources of liquidity. Digital innovation can make the entire trade ecosystem more efficient more inclusive and less costly. The pandemic has brought additional urgency to the need to solve the hurdles hindering fragile supply chains and the financing of trade.

For banks digitalization offers a reduction in operating costs and more accurate records of transactions which can be used to provide trade insights. It also provides more reliable and instant know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks which can cut compliance costs.

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret scanned documents and check them against a set of predefined rules and regulations allows banks to focus on the anomalies highlighted by AI rather than spend their time on labor-intensive reading of documents manually and other repetitive tasks that take up much of their time. Benefits are not limited to banks. All parties across trade transactions benefit from reduced costs greater fraud mitigation and the optimization of working capital.

The use of optical character recognition (OCR) machine learning and neural language processing significantly lowers errors in trade-related documentation while the consolidation of digital trade documentation into a single electronic file brings further efficiencies to the multiple parties in various jurisdictions including trading partners financial institutions credit insurers shipping companies customs and other services providers.

The digital ledger of transactions created on a blockchain provides trade participants with all the necessary trade information in one digital document. Blockchain also creates the means to perform sustainability screening and verification which could help scale up the delivery of green trade finance and sustainability-linked trade finance deals such as the one announced between HSBC and clothing company Epic Group which ties pricing to ESG targets including greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater use intensity.

While the world was forced to close borders and become more insular interoperability between players and platforms has offered a way forward for all participants in trade finance where cooperation promises a more inclusive and less fragmented approach to trade.

Last year the World Bank said that to fully reap the benefits of new technologies the entire trade ecosystem—banks regulators border agencies trade bodies and corporates—must work together to apply digital innovation and drive efficiencies. This collaborative approach will help drive the future of trade finance and help meet substantiality objectives.

Methodology: Behind the Rankings

Global Finance editors select the winners for both the Trade Finance Awards and the Supply Chain Finance Awards with input from industry analysts corporate executives and technology experts. The editors also consider entries submitted by financial services providers as well as independent research taking into account a set of objective and subjective factors. This year’s ratings which cover 102 countries and eight regions were based on performance during the period from the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021.

It is not necessary to enter in order to win but experience shows that the additional information supplied in an entry can increase the chance of success. In many cases entrants are able to present details and insights that may not be readily available to the editors of Global Finance.

The winners are those banks and providers that best serve the specialized needs of corporations as they engage in cross-border trade. The winners are not always the biggest institutions but rather the best: those with qualities that companies should consider most carefully when choosing a provider. Global Finance uses a proprietary algorithm with criteria—such as knowledge of local conditions and customer needs financial strength and safety strategic relationships and governance competitive pricing capital investment and innovation in products and services—weighted for relative importance. Each entity is rated on each separate criterion. The algorithm incorporates those ratings into a single numeric score with 100 equivalent to perfection. In cases where more than one institution earns the same score we favor local providers over global institutions and privately-owned over government-owned institutions.

There’s no doubt that cryptocurrency is gaining broader acceptance across the globe. In 2021 El Salvador became the first country to accept cryptocurrency as legal tender and the market capitalization of all cryptocurrency broke $3 trillion in late 2021 before falling back to about $2 trillion in the early weeks of 2022.

Banks in the U.S. still don’t allow customers to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies though. Primarily this is a regulatory issue as cryptocurrencies are so volatile that they could upset the stability of the banking system. But banks also shy away from cryptocurrency because its success may devalue the very dollar-based banking that makes them profitable. Still there are ways you can use banking institutions to acquire Bitcoin and potentially other cryptos as well. Here are five of your best options.

Ally Bank

As with other banks on this list Ally Bank doesn’t allow customers to directly buy Bitcoin and keep it in their checking or savings accounts. However there is somewhat of a loophole where you can use Ally Bank to acquire Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Ally Bank allows customers to link their accounts to Coinbase a cryptocurrency exchange platform in the same fashion they would link an outside bank account. Using your Ally Bank debit card you can then purchase cryptocurrency at Coinbase. It may not be the same as buying cryptocurrency directly at the bank but it’s clear that Ally is moving in a crypto-friendly direction by allowing customers to do this.

USAA

USAA like all U.S. banks doesn’t allow customers to buy cryptocurrency. However if you have a USAA bank account you can also link it to your Coinbase cryptocurrency account. While you still can’t physically buy crypto through your USAA account you’ll be able to track your Bitcoin wallet at Coinbase once it’s linked. This will give you the ability to view your balances and monitor your transactions at Coinbase through your USAA account. This alone makes USAA one of the more crypto-friendly banks out there. Perhaps at some point it may be among the first to allow actual cryptocurrency transactions.

Simple Bank/BBVA

Simple Bank was acquired by BBVA in early 2021. Prior to that Simple allowed customers to make cryptocurrency purchases in the same manner as Ally Bank. In other words Simple customers could use the fintech’s debit card to buy cryptocurrency. BBVA no longer allows this workaround but there is some promise for the future. BBVA Switzerland has a digital investment account called New Gen that allows investments in cryptocurrencies. The account doesn’t have any net worth requirements and only requires a deposit of the Euro equivalent of about $10000. If more international accounts such as this begin to pop up they may eventually spread to the U.S. though it’s far from certain.

Morgan Stanley

In the first quarter of 2021 Morgan Stanley became the first U.S. bank to offer Bitcoin to its clients. However this doesn’t mean that any banking customer can simply buy Bitcoin with their accounts. For starters this accessibility is limited to high net worth individuals and only Bitcoin funds can be purchased not the actual cryptocurrency. However this is still a way that high net worth individuals can access an investment in cryptocurrency via a U.S.-based bank. If this “experiment” proves profitable for the bank and if clients continue to clamor for the ability to buy cryptocurrency it’s possible that access will be expanded to general banking customers someday.

Chime

Chime1 also doesn’t allow direct cryptocurrency purchases but it’s crypto-friendly because you can still use it to indirectly access crypto. You can use your Chime account to make instant transfers to friends with its Pay Friends feature. Via the Pay Friends feature you can access peer-to-peer Bitcoin network Paxful so that your payment ultimately ends up in your friend’s account as Bitcoin. This may be a far cry from Chime allowing Bitcoin transactions but the end result is that you can use your Chime account to affect a Bitcoin transaction. In today’s banking environment that’s enough to make Chime “crypto-friendly” by way of comparison.

U.S. officials vow to unleash searing economic measures if Russia invades Ukraine including sanctions on its largest banks and financial institutions in ways that would inevitably affect daily life in Russia.

But the strategy comes with political and economic risks. No nation has ever tried to enact broad sanctions against such large financial institutions and on an economy the size of Russia’s. And the “swift and severe” response that U.S. officials have promised could roil major economies particularly those in Europe and even threaten the stability of the global financial system analysts say.

Some analysts also warn of a potential escalatory spiral.

BROWERVILLE Minn. — *Editor's note: This story originally aired Jan. 16 2018 ahead of Super Bowl LII at U.S. Bank Stadium.

Paul Johnson was a bit bleary eyed when he welcomed strangers from the Twin Cities on Monday.

“Very tired today” said Paul as the visitors entered his shed. “I was up till 4:30 in the morning.”

The exhaustion is understandable. It’s hard to get enough of the post-game analysis after your first cousin just quarterbacked his team to a miraculous fifth super bowl win.

Tom Brady grew up in California but each summer as a boy he returned to the Browerville area to spend time with his grandparents on the farm where his mother grew up.

“He was our little hyperactive kid” says Paul of his younger cousin. “I remember him throwing baseballs and busting grandpa’s windows.”

Paul says “Tommy” had a mile-wide competitive streak whether fishing golfing or playing cards.

Tom Brady’s uncle Gary Johnson smiles and adds “The genetic genius comes from the Johnson side. Gary’s wife Diane slaps his knee but can’t hide her own pride.

“Oh what a great gift what a great gift he’s given us” she says.

For 17 seasons the Johnson family has gathered around a TV to watch Tom play football most of those games viewed right here in the shed.

The walls are lined with deer mounts fishing gear and enough Patriots’ memorabilia to satisfy any New Englander.

On the bulletin board are pictures of Tom Brady during visits to Browerville. His last was this past summer when he read a reading at his grandfather’s funeral.

Galynn Brady Tom’s mother is Gary Johnson’s sister. She met Tom’s father a California insurance agent while working as a flight attendant.

Galynn’s battle with cancer was revealed to the nation Sunday night after her son guided the Patriots to an unlikely come-from-behind victory.

“With his mom being not well it just was meant to be” says Diane Johnson.

Paul shows a picture of his family taken two seasons ago at a Patriots game they watched in Brady’s suite.

Paul says his cousin has never forgotten his family. “Hasn’t changed a bit and that’s what we respect most about him he treats us the same and wants us to treat him the same.”"

A look back at 2021

As everyone adapted to this “new normal” people continued to use Uber in all different ways to suit their changing needs - whether it be from their homes on their holidays at their place of work and everywhere in between!

Where It Traveled

The roll out of vaccines and relaxing of some restrictions over the course of the year meant that international travel became an option again for many. It also saw an increase in the number of people commuting into offices and places of work again – in fact 6:00pm in the UAE was when drivers received the most trip requests as the workday ends and offices clear out.

Some of the key travel trends from 2021:

The year’s #1 rider: A rider in Saudi Arabia topped the charts with an impressive 1706 trips this year - taking on average 4 trips a day!

The year’s #1 driver: Drivers have been busy too with the top drivers making thousands of trips through the app such as 7613 in the Eastern Province in KSA 6978 in Cairo and 4244 in Dubai.

Uber Bus: Reaching another milestone Uber Bus witnessed growth of 2.4x compared to 2020 as it continued to facilitate affordable trips for commuters across Cairo.

Vaccination-bound: supporting the community through the pandemic riders have taken more than 126355 free or discounted trips through the app to and from Covid-19 vaccination centers.

International jet-setters: 2021 saw the rebirth of traveling and from Los Angeles to Sydney people around the world love to use Uber when abroad. People from 80 countries used the Uber app while visiting Egypt and from 84 countries while visiting the UAE.

Tourist traps: The tourist hot spots in the Middle East were popular trip destinations with 14747 trips to the Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. The Burj Khalifa the tallest building in the world was also popular racking up 319596 trips. The Boulevard in Riyadh is also one of the top destinations in KSA.

Evening festivities: As restrictions eased riders enjoyed the revival to their social lives with Zamalek ranking as the #1 nightlife destination in Egypt with 669222 trips.

Drivers across MENA received 109541802 5-star rated trips which translated into tipping with an 80% increase on tipping in Mecca compared to 2020 according to the statement.

2022:

One of the company’s key priorities in 2022 will be to support the mobility technology industry to recover and grow as it works to achieve our overarching vision of a convenient smart and sustainable mobility ecosystem.

Uber will continue to be bold using Uber’s technology merged with our hyperlocal approach to innovate faster. The company is more focused than ever on making Uber the best platform for earners while also championing women empowerment across the region through initiatives such as Wusool Uber’s largest subsidized program globally.

Riders remain a key focus as it looks to facilitate more ridesharing options features and even more advanced safety.

According to the statement the company will continue to innovate with new products and initiatives that help move us together with strategic partners governments drivers and of course riders as it works to make the Uber app an essential part of everyday life.

The incident occurred Thursday Jan. 27 when the “Gin and Juice” rapper took to his Instagram account following a failed delivery of his meal. Viewers can see the exchange between the driver and the California rapper.

The driver tells Snoop he arrived. “I’ve arrived. Hello. Plz call not sure where to leave your order. Hello” the man tells Snoop. Before the star could text back the drive sends another text telling him “This is not a safe place” seemingly taking off with the rapper’s food never to return. The “Doggy Dogg World” rapper instructs the driver where to place the food but he never responds.

Snoop Dogg calls out Uber Eats after delivery man refuses to drop off order claiming area “is not a safe place.” @snoopdogg/Instagram

“Muthaf-cker from f-cking Uber Eats didn’t bring my f-cking food talking about he arrived” the 50-year-old emcee snapped in the 12-second clip. “‘This is not a safe place.’ Punk muthaf-cker where my food at n-gga? You got all my god damn money punk.”

Snoop used the caption portion of his post to call out the food delivery service demanding to know “where my food at” followed by several anger emojis. He later called on Uber Eats’ competitor Postmates to “holla at me.”

This video was viewed over 3.5 million times as fans in the comments section sympathized with the Grammy-nominated artist. “DONT MESS WITH A HUNGRY MAN FOOD” wrote entertainment blog site RAP. “They need to get some more serious post mates employees” wrote another person. “Ayooo lmfaooo  it’s snoop dogg better bring that food thru a warzone if he needed it” joked a third Instagram user.

Still some critics called out the entertainer for waiting past the grace period of eight minutes which started once the driver announced that he had arrived to respond.

“[To] be fair you ain’t reply for 8 minutes after he said he arrived??” wrote one reviewer. “Exactly nobody got time to be sitting there waiting on they ass we do have surges” another agreed.

Uber Eats has yet to address Snoop’s recent customer service experience.

""It was an honest mistake sir. All I need is the order back. The food or the money. I cannot afford to pay for this. This is not my fault. You knew you didn’t order the food and you took it"" the UberEats driver says.

""If I show this video to the police then it’s gonna be you. You’re the one that’s gonna be at fault here"" she tells the man. Even though the woman constantly demands the money or the food and accuses the man of taking an order that wasn't his he denies ever taking the wings and refuses to cough up any cash.

""It’s either you give me the wings and the remainder of the order or you give me the $17.22."" He responds by saying ""I don’t have no money for you and I don’t have no wings for you."" The UberEats driver accuses the man of changing his behavior after she begins recording to imply guilt: ""Now you want to act all innocent because I’m filming you.""

The interaction sparked a debate in the comments section. There were some who claimed to be UberEats drivers that stated that it was entirely the TikTok user's fault as she delivered the food to the wrong address initially. Another user with the handle @bigmo253 penned ""As a Uber eats driver. The app will send another driver with the right food to the correct location. No need to talk to the customer.""

Others however thought that the customer was grimy for taking food that he knows he didn't order: ""all yall saying its her fault he's still in the wrong"" @axc_maree4x said. Then there were others who thought that they both were in the wrong and then there were those who would have admitted to eating the wings but that they would've paid her too.

Kim Kardashian has boosted her net worth by approximately $600m according to Forbes.

The 41-year-old reality TV star is now estimated to be worth roughly $1.8bn.

The boost in revenue has come from an additional $240m in financing for Kardashian’s shapewear label Skims after an investment led by hedge fund Lone Pine Capital with participation from D1 Capital Partners as well as previous investors including Imaginary Ventures Alliance Consumer Growth and Thrive Capital.

Now Skims which sells a range of bras bodysuits loungewear and lingerie has boosted its value to £3.2b which is up from $1.6bn in April 2021.

Kardashian continues to hold a majority of the company alongside her Skims cofounder and CEO Jane Grede.

It was first reported that Kardashian had become a billionaire in April 2021 with the majority of her net worth coming from the cosmetics company she owns KKW Beauty which she launched in 2017.

According to the outlet the business mogul who was first mentioned in Forbes in 2011 when she reached 6.6m Twitter followers had also increased her net worth through reality television and endorsement deals as well as a “number of smaller investments” such as investments in Disney Amazon Netflix and Adidas which were gifted to her by her estranged husband Kanye West.

Forbes’ valuation of Kardashian came after the outlet previously stripped Kylie Jenner of her billionaire status in May 2020.

At the time Forbes which declared Jenner the “world’s youngest self-made billionaire” in March 2019 accused the Kylie Cosmetics founder of “inflating the size and success of her business”.

West was previously named a billionaire by Forbes in April 2020 when the outlet published a feature titled: “Kanye West is now officially a billionaire - and he really wants the world to know.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd29tZW5sb3ZldGVjaC5jb20vc25hcGNoYXRzLWFyLWNhcGFiaWxpdGllcy1leHBhbmQtaW50by1iZWF1dHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snapchat's AR capabilities Expand Into Beauty,"Snapchat has become known for its AR driven retail capabilities with brands like Gucci Prada and Ray-Ban encouraging consumers to shop virtually via the platform. With thousands of products to try on using AR Snapchatters are exploring their style try on digital versions of products they’ve been lusting after (handy if you’re caught in a lockdown) and click through to purchase via the app.

I took the ULTA Beauty and MAC Cosmetic filters for a spin!

Snap Chat Beauty: Ruby takes Snap Chat for a spin

ULTA:

Currently the ULTA filter allows you to browse several mascaras – Benefit They’re Real and Maybelline Great Lash amongst them. While the full false lash effect some of the filters give you aren’t entirely realistic they provide a good indication of what you can expect from the formulas and a great point of comparison. Maybelline Great Lash gives wispy length while the “They’re Real” packs a full voluminous punch.

MAC:

The MAC store on Snapchat is a little more detailed. You can try on eyeshadows lipsticks and even full limited-edition collections here.

I tried on the Cruella Disney Collection which is applied live by a virtual artist – you can even tailor your look by opting for different shades from the Cruella shadow palette.

AR has a way to go before colour matching foundation is made a breeze (things like skin hydration levels texture and coverage are still hard to ascertain in an augmented environment). However these filters provide ample opportunity to explore makeup styles you may want to try IRL.

It also makes online shopping fun. There’s nothing like browsing the mall with your friends and Snapchat brings us one step closer to achieving that in an online environment. The app enables you to share your “try-on” with friends and live chat with them. This function is a boon for businesses too – the Snapchat community has reported that close friends are 4x more influential than celebrities or influencers on their purchasing decisions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25jb3VudHlpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS81dGgtZ3JhZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5th grade West Bend West JR Spartans win Fondy Big “B” Tournament | By Dominic Ladd,"Join my email list By clicking submit you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing updates and other emails from the site owner.

The purchase marks the largest number of FLXDrives placed in a single order for Wabtec and the largest investment in battery technology by a North American railroad.

The order will upgrade Union Pacific’s rail yard infrastructure and support its commitment to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“As an industry leader Union Pacific is pioneering a major application of battery power in its rail yards” said Rafael Santana President and CEO for Wabtec. “Battery power is an ideal solution to reduce the environmental impact and costs of yard operations. Using the FLXdrive in the rail yard can significantly improve local air quality as well as reduce noise by up to 70% for neighboring communities.”

Founded in 1862 Union Pacific Railroad is a freight-hauling railroad that operates 8300 locomotives over 32200 miles routes in 23 of the Western United States including Illinois and Louisiana. It considers battery-electric trains the most environmentally-friendly means to transport freight. The approximately 2.5-MWh locomotives are each powered solely by 7000 battery cells providing Union Pacific with a zero-emission solution for its yard operations.

According to the press release the ten FLXdrives will enable the railroad to eliminate 4000 tons of carbon annually from its rail yards which is equivalent to removing 800 cars from the highway. The new electric locomotives will be manufactured in the United States and the first units being delivered to Union Pacific in late 2023.

Union Pacific published its first comprehensive Climate Action Plan in December 2021 outlining its efforts to significantly reduce emissions within its operations. As part of that plan Union Pacific will reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 26% by 2030 and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Earlier this month Rio Tinto announced an order for four FLXdrive battery-electric locomotives to support suitable operations of the mining company’s rail network in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The United Aviate Academy is the first flight school owned by a major U.S. airline. United welcomed its first class of students which is made up of 80% women or people of color.

""Our pilots are the best in the industry and have set a high standard of excellence"" United CEO Scott Kirby said in a press release. ""Recruiting and training even more people who have that same level of talent motivation and skill is the right thing to do and will make us an even better airline.""

The academy provides an important source for recruitment as the industry faces a potential shortage of around 34000 pilots globally by 2025 according to analytics firm Oliver Wyman. The shortage will result from an aging pilot population and career changes for furloughed pilots who couldn't wait for the airlines to rehire them.

United projects that the academy will train around 5000 new pilots by 2030 – fulfilling half of its plan to recruit 10000 new pilots in that time to combat the shortage.

American Airlines (AA) launched its Cadet Academy in 2018 which works with partner schools and provides financing to help aspiring pilots earn their license and eventually find employment at a major carrier.

""We continue to increase our pilot hiring efforts this year and beyond and are continuously investing in both our pilot training and cadet academy programs"" an AA spokesperson told FOX Business. ""Our goal is to grow the pilot population incrementally and remove barriers for students while creating greater diversity amongst the future and current pilot ranks.""

AA also told Fox that the company hired more than 500 pilots in 2021 and expects to recruit more than 2000 in the coming year.

And Delta Airlines announced during its Q4 financial results conference call that it has recruited between 100 and 200 pilots a month and expects that pace to continue ""for some period of time.""

""Certainly through 2022 and into 2023"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said. ""We don’t want to get too far ahead of ourselves but that’s the pace that we’re hiring at.""

A minor inconvenience at the most.

If you don’t sweat convenience fees hit the Bank of America ATM in the same parking lot or roll through the Wells Fargo branch a couple hundred yards away. You could head across the street to the M&F Bank branch at the shopping center across the street.

Or drop the car into drive and motor to the new 11200-square-foot SECU branch 4 miles away on Waughtown Street.

But to a significant chunk of residents living in East Winston — the 27101 zip code specifically — the closings turned out to be more hardship than hassle.

“It’s a real blow for us” said 68-year-old Tommy Williams who worked as a custodian for Forsyth County before having to retire early with disability.

Differences

For a lot of us one bank branch is as good as the next.

But if you don’t have a car live in public housing over at Sunrise Towers or barely squeak by month to month on a fixed income life got a whole lot harder when the East Winston SECU branch closed in October and its parking-lot ATM boarded up at the end of November.

To fully understand how it’s instructive to know a few things.

Credit unions SECU included operate differently than banks. They’re member-owned and not-for-profit.

Access to bank savings and checking accounts can be prohibitive for some consumers. Credit unions tend to offer better interest rates lower service fees and in many instances geared toward those who find access to traditional banks difficult to come by.

“A credit union is the easiest way to get financial support on our end of town” said Lafayette Jones a former member of the state Credit Union Commission and a driving force in founding the Goler Community Development Corporation. “One of the missions of a credit union is to serve the underserved.”

So closing the branch in East Winston based on demographic information compiled by the U.S. Census carried an undeniable impact for people who could least afford another hurdle.

A few important figures for the 27101 zip code:

Roughly 18900 people live there. The median household income is $24350 — half of the residents make more half make less. The median value of a house is $118700.

Fully 54 percent of residents rent houses duplexes or apartments; 31 percent carry mortgages or own outright their homes.

Nearly 14 percent walk ride a bike or rely on public transportation; 82 percent own a car truck or van.

For comparison’s sake consider the same figures for the 27104 zip code Buena Vista neighborhoods along Country Club and points west:

It has some 28500 residents with a median household income of $52480 a median home value of $229700.

Just over 55 percent of residents own their homes; 36 percent rent.

More than 91 percent own vehicles and just 2.3 percent take the bus walk or ride a bike to get around.

It’s worth mentioning such disparities to better understand how something as basic as an ATM or branch office can carry such outsized importance.

But noting the differences and pointing out the impact isn’t about complaining. It’s about finding solutions.

“This is a story of community need” Jones said. ”Our community has a different need. (SECU) didn’t close it because they’re mean. None of that.”

Unintended consequences

Williams realized the implications of the closure as soon as the notifications went up.

“A lot of my neighbors they’re elderly live in Sunrise Towers or disabled; they don’t have cars” he said.

Financial dealings for many are conducted via direct deposits cash withdrawals or money orders. “Very few people use personal checks anymore” he said.

To illustrate his point Williams used himself as an example.

Until the fall in order to pay his rent Williams typically went into the branch and got a cashier’s check. “They’d even make it out for you” he said.

Because he has a car Williams can get to another branch. Or he can drive to another CashPoints ATM perhaps in the Northside Shopping Center and somewhere else to buy a money order to pay the landlord.

A $2 service charge to use a nearby bank or a buck for a money order are factors. “People only use those (bank ATMs) if they’re desperate.”

The East Winston SECU branch Williams was told closed in part due to concerns about crime and employee safety.

Plus a new branch opened in early 2021 on Waughtown Street. It’s only four miles from Eastway but that’s a long walk or several bus transfers away.

“The branch and the ATM were formerly located at a rental site in the (East Winston Shopping Center)” wrote Sandra Jones a spokeswoman for SECU. “After serving the community for several years from this rental site we decided to purchase property and establish a more permanent base from which to continue serving our members who live and work in the area.”

SECU is also looking for alternate locations for an ATM in the neighborhood. She did not mention fear of crime as a factor.

“We have seniors who don’t go out at night because they’re frightened of little kids with big guns” Williams said. “I get that.”

If crime did play a role even a minor one Williams isn’t looking for a scapegoat. He’s a forward thinker so he contacted Jones because he knew Jones’ background and a shared goal of finding solutions when problems arise.

No formal plans have been put forward; it’s a work in progress. But a few early stage ideas include helping to scout for an alternate location for an ATM and a satellite branch scrounging for grant money to pay the rent if need be — nothing’s free in this world — and perhaps organizing some sort of citizens’ watch to address any concerns over safety.

“A credit union is the easiest way to get financial support in our end of town” Jones said. “No one is proposing sitting around and saying ‘Gee isn’t this awful?’

“God loves those who help themselves.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy83LXJlYXNvbnMtd2h5LWNvc3Rjby1tZW1iZXJzaGlwLTE3MDAwMzAzOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Reasons Why a Costco Membership Could Save You Big in 2022,"ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com

We know you’ve heard of a Costco card but maybe you’ve passed it up because of the annual membership fee. Gold Star and Business memberships are $60 a year while the Executive Membership is $120 a year. All memberships come with a free Household Card that you can assign to someone else living with you (or working with for a Business Membership) provided they’re over 18.

Though it might seem unreasonable to pay for a membership to a retail store it’s been reported that you can save over $90 each time you go to Costco rather than heading to your local grocery store. This more than makes up for that annual fee. Need some more convincing? Below is a list of reasons why you should join 100 million others and get a Costco membership if you want to save money in 2022.

Costco Gas is Cheaper

Americans spend between $400 and $1300 a year on gas so any chance to save is much appreciated. With any Costco membership in addition to the warehouses you get access to Costco gas stations. The big advantage to that is that Costco’s Kirkland Signature Gasoline is typically 20 cents below the market average. If you stick to using the pump at Costco gas stations this can save you a good amount of money over time.

Buying in Bulk Saves Cash

Costco is known for their jumbo cases of water condiments and pretty much any other household item. Even though it’s initially more expensive than what you’d spend at the grocery store you’re stocking up for months to come. Plus a 10 percent larger package typically saves you 5 percent in cost. The best items to buy in bulk are the Kirkland brand of non-perishable foods meat (you can always freeze it later) paper products soap garbage bags pet food and coffee to name a few.

Price Codes Tell You Where the Deals Are

It’s important to look closely at the prices at Costco particularly the last two digits because then you’ll know when you’re getting the best deal. If you’re looking to buy something that ends in .99 that means it’s a wholesale price. However if it ends in .97 that means that’s the best discount you’ll be able to find so it’s even lower than the original wholesale price. Now you can always feel confident knowing you’re getting the lowest possible price on the items you’re buying.

United's non-alliance airline partners

(Photo by Nicky Kelvin/The Points Guy)

United also maintains a handful of non-alliance partnerships with various airlines. These partnerships let United customers gain access to even more cities around the world. You can earn and redeem miles with these partners in most cases though some may have restrictions.

For example you can only earn and redeem United miles on intra-island Hawaiian Airlines flights. Hawaiian Airlines flights from the mainland U.S. are not eligible to earn United miles and cannot be booked with United miles. But when you book United flights from the continental U.S. to Hawaii on miles an inter-island flight on Hawaiian Airlines could be ""free"" thanks to United's excursionist perk.

Here's a look at all of United's non-alliance airline partners:

Aer Lingus.

AeroMar.

Air Dolomiti.

Airlink.

Azul.

Boutique Air.

Cape Air.

Edelweiss.

Eurowings.

Earning United miles with partners

From airlines to car rental companies United has a ton of different partners that you can earn and redeem miles with. Here's a quick overview:

Earning miles with United airline partners

You can earn United miles when you add your MileagePlus number to flights operated by any one of United's various partners. You'll earn miles based on how much you spend if United issues your ticket (booked through United.com) and distance flown if a partner tickets your flight.

The number of miles you'll earn on partner tickets depends on the airline you're flying the fare class you're booked in and your United Premier status level. For example a Lufthansa flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Frankfurt (FRA) booked in N fare premium economy would earn 5806 miles as N fares earn 100% mileage flown. This is because the flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Frankfurt Germany (FRA) is 5806 miles.

(Screenshot from united.com)

Each United Premier status level gets its own mileage bonus on partner flights. Silver Gold Platinum and 1K elites earn 25% 50% 75% and 100% bonus miles on partner tickets respectively. So if you're a Premier 1K member you'd earn 11612 United miles on the LAX-FRA ticket mentioned earlier.

You can also earn Premier qualifying points (PQPs) and Premier qualifying flights (PQFs) from United's partners. However note that some fare classes may be ineligible for mileage credit. Furthermore United has limited the PQPs you can earn on a given flight.

You can view the earning rates for all of United's airline partners on United's website. Review these pages closely — sometimes airlines restrict mileage earning to specific routes and fare classes.

Hotel partnerships

United has partnerships with most major hotel chains. Some earn a set number of United miles per stay while others earn miles based on how much you spend at a given hotel. Many hotel loyalty programs also let you transfer your hotel points to United though that usually isn't the best use of points.

Here's a high-level look at all of United's hotel partnerships:

Premier Silver and Premier Gold members earn 1000 United miles on every rental.

To earn miles provide your MileagePlus membership number when you rent. However know that you may need to pay a frequent traveler program surcharge if you decide to earn United miles on your rental.

United flyers can also take advantage of discounts up to 35% with Avis and Budget using their respective discount numbers. However our tests only found 5-8% discounts when using these codes.

Earning miles with United credit cards

United Airlines has an exclusive partnership with Chase to issue credit cards in the U.S. Each of these cards offers various perks points earning rates and sign-up bonuses. Plus you can use these cards to earn United miles on everyday purchases.

Here's an overview of the currently available United personal cards and their bonuses:

United Gateway Card : Earn 30000 bonus miles after you spend $1000 on purchases in the first three months your account is open.

: Earn 30000 bonus miles after you spend $1000 on purchases in the first three months your account is open. United Explorer Card : Earn 60000 bonus miles after you spend $3000 on purchases in the first three months your account is open.

Of these cards the United Explorer Card is one of the most popular. This card has a relatively low annual fee of $95 (waived for the first year) and earns 2 United miles per dollar on hotel stays when booked with the hotel United purchases and dining. It includes two one-time United Club passes per year a free first checked bag and priority boarding on United flights.

More frequent United flyers may opt for the higher-end United Club Infinite Card. This card has a higher $525 annual fee but includes a full United Club membership and Premier Access on all United flights. Even better you'll earn 4 miles per dollar spent on United purchases 2 miles per dollar spent on all other travel and dining and 1 mile per dollar spent on everything else.

The United Gateway Card on the other hand earns 2 miles per dollar spent on United purchases gas stations local transit and commuting and 1 mile per dollar spent on everything else. The card has no annual fee so it can be a good option for infrequent travelers.

United also has two business credit cards:

United Business Card : Earn 50000 bonus miles after you spend $5000 on purchases in the first three months your account is open. Plus $0 introductory annual fee for the first year then $99.

This card earns 2 miles per dollar spent on United purchases dining gas stations office supply stores local transit and commuting. The United Club Business Card's finest feature is that it provides United Club membership at an annual fee of $450 per year.

Transferring miles from Chase Ultimate Rewards

One of our favorite ways to earn United miles is through Chase Ultimate Rewards. You can transfer your Ultimate Rewards points to United at a 1:1 ratio meaning that 10000 Ultimate Rewards points are equal to 10000 United miles.

In many cases earning United miles through Chase Ultimate Rewards credit cards is more lucrative than spending on one of the United cards we mentioned earlier. While you don't get airline-specific benefits like checked bags you can earn more miles on everyday purchases. And you can transfer your Ultimate Rewards points to other airlines if you find a better mileage deal.

Redeeming miles on partner flights

(Photo by Andrew Kunesh/The Points Guy)

United recently switched to dynamic award pricing for all partner award tickets. The price of most partner awards went up by at least 10% in early 2020 making United miles significantly less valuable for partner awards. Regardless it's good to have the option to redeem miles on these flights if you have miles available to you.

That said United generally prices award space on its planes lower than flights operated by partners. Unfortunately United charges additional miles if you connect from a United flight to a partner flight.

(Screenshot from united.com)

For example you could book a flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Oslo Norway (OSL) via Zurich (ZRH) for 33000 United miles one-way in economy class. In this example itinerary United operates the SFO to ZRH segment and Swiss operates the ZRH to OSL segment. United would charge 30000 miles for just the SFO to ZRH flight so you are paying an extra 3000 miles for the inter-Europe flight.

Still this means that you can leverage United's partner flight network to fly to destinations not served by United for not too many additional miles. Essentially you can fly to just about anywhere in the world using your United miles.

You can find award space for virtually all United partners on the United website. This includes non-alliance partners like Aer Lingus and Hawaiian Airlines as well as all of the carrier's Star Alliance partners. United's website is often considered the best Star Alliance search tool.

Reciprocal elite status benefits

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

All United Premier elites get reciprocal benefits on all Star Alliance carriers. United Premier Silver members are eligible for Star Alliance Silver status while United Premier Gold and above are eligible for the more lucrative Star Alliance Gold status. These benefits can make your flight experience easier when flying on partner carriers.

To take advantage of your Star Alliance benefits when flying partners just add your United MileagePlus number to a partner booking. Here's a look at both Star Alliance Silver and Star Alliance Gold benefits:

Star Alliance Silver

Star Alliance Silver status is pretty bare bones. It includes very minimal benefits that while helpful won't drastically change your airport experience.

These benefits include:

Priority wait-listing: If your desired class of service isn't available at the time of booking your status gives you higher priority on the waitlist. This does not apply to award tickets.

If your desired class of service isn't available at the time of booking your status gives you higher priority on the waitlist. This does not apply to award tickets. Priority airport standby: Your status gives you higher priority on the standby list for your preferred flight except when you are traveling on an award ticket. This can be helpful if you want to fly on an earlier flight.

Star Alliance Gold

Things get more interesting with Star Alliance Gold status. These members are eligible for more tangible benefits like lounge access and priority security.

Here's a look at the full suite of Star Alliance Gold benefits:

Gold Track security: You can use dedicated Gold Track security lanes before Star Alliance flights.

You can use dedicated Gold Track security lanes before Star Alliance flights. Extra baggage allowance: You can take an extra 44 pounds of checked baggage on partner flights.

Bottom line

United has a slew of different partners making it one of the easiest airlines with which to earn miles. We highly recommend starting with a Chase Ultimate Rewards card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card if you're just beginning your mileage journey. After all you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to United (and other programs).

When it comes to redeeming miles you'll get the best deals by redeeming United miles for flights operated by United. However you can still leverage the airline's vast partner network to redeem miles if United doesn't serve your destination of choice.

Suddenly you find a crystal-clear pool full of turtles and fish. The teal color of the water is something you’ve never seen before.

You can grab a snorkel and swim where the water’s depth is 30 feet all the while still being able to see the bottom of the oasis.

There are restored desert wetlands for you to explore where endangered fish and animals live where you can truly connect with nature and experience a unique ecosystem.

Welcome to Balmorhea State Park!

What is Balmorhea State Park?

Balmorhea State Park is a 46-acre state park on the San Solomon Springs in Texas.

The most prized section of the park is a 3.5-million gallon freshwater pool built along the springs. It is the world’s biggest spring-fed swimming pool. Due to its constant flow of water there is no need to chlorinate it.

The park also has a restored cienega (desert wetland).

While they are closed for renovations as of June 26 2021 there are usually lots of campsites and cabins for people to stay in.

History

In 1934 the Texas State Parks Board bought San Solomon Springs. As part of the New Deal the Civilian Conservation Corps built the spring water pool in 1936-1941.

In 1995 the Balmorhea State Park Cienega Project was started. Its purpose was to recreate the desert wetland that was originally lost when the spring water was channeled into the pool.

Now the cienega is a home for endangered fish birds and animals.

Over 200000 people visit the park each year!

Where is Balmorhea State Park located in Texas?

Now as California lawmakers once again get close to establishing such a program all eyes are on Newsom to see how he will come down on the issue — and whether the millions he and his party received from health insurance industry donors will convince him to abandon the cause he previously touted. A new bill would move to replace the state’s private insurance market with a public system in which the government is the single-payer for health care services. Due to the rules of the state’s legislature the bill must pass the state’s full assembly by the end of the day Monday or it’s dead for another year. As the Democratic governor Newsom has significant influence over what the Democratic legislature sends to his desk — but he has remained publicly aloof about the bill implying he may block it as his industry donors mount an opposition campaign. “Governor Newsom has no choice but to sign a bill and put it on the ballot as he’s promised he wants to” says Jamie Court president of the consumer and taxpayer advocacy group Consumer Watchdog. “I don’t think he can get out of that promise.”

A Long Battle The current legislation AB 1400 would establish a new agency called CalCare that would pay for basic medical services in the state. If it passes Californians would then vote on whether to approve a tax increase to fund the program — a vote that might not happen until 2024. The legislation is opposed by a variety of business interests including the California Chamber of Commerce the National Federation of Independent Business and health insurers. “I have not had the opportunity to review that plan and no one has presented it to me” Newsom recently said of the legislation. “I think that the ideal system is a single-payer system. I’ve been consistent with that for well over a decade. . . . The difference here is when you are in a position of responsibility you’ve gotta apply you’ve gotta manifest the ideal. This is hard work. It’s one thing to say it’s another to do.” California already has near-universal health insurance coverage thanks to incremental extensions of coverage for undocumented immigrants through the state’s Medicaid program Medi-Cal and subsidies from the Affordable Care Act. In January Newsom announced that his new budget which would extend Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented immigrants of any age would make California the first state to achieve universal coverage. “I campaigned on universal health care” Newsom declared the day after announcing his plan. “We’re delivering that.” In achieving near-universal coverage through private markets however the governor appears to be pivoting away from single-payer. The state has been down this road many times before going as far back as 1918 when voters rejected an effort to create a state health care program for the poor. Single-payer legislation finally made it out of committee in 1992 after Democratic governor Jerry Brown endorsed it during a Democratic presidential primary debate that year — but the effort ultimately failed in the state senate. Then in 1994 the California Nurses’ Union pushed Prop 186 to establish single-payer in the state but the measure was overwhelmingly defeated following a campaign by a coalition of business groups insurance companies and hospitals. While state lawmakers succeeded in passing single-payer legislation in 2006 Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill when it arrived at his desk — and vetoed an amended version of the legislation two years later. In 2017 when single-payer came up again in California it appeared more likely to pass. The state had already dramatically expanded health care coverage in response to the Affordable Care Act Democrats held supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature and Brown had once again been elected governor. At the same time polling showed most Californians supported the creation of a taxpayer-funded universal health care system. The tide seemed to be turning nationally as well. The presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders (Ind-VT) had exposed mainstream America to the concept of Medicare For All and twenty-seven members of California’s congressional delegation had signed onto a federal Medicare For All bill. Newsom the lieutenant governor at the time even made single-payer health care a plank of his campaign. Yet once again the reform efforts were stymied when Democratic assembly speaker Anthony Rendon refused to hold a vote on the bill for the duration of the year even though it had already passed the senate. According to Rendon he did so because “there are potentially fatal flaws in the bill including the fact it does not address many serious issues such as financing delivery of care cost controls or the realities of needed action by the Trump administration and voters need to make [it] a genuine piece of legislation.” But there was likely another reason the bill died: big business had stepped in to quash it. As International Business Times reported at the time since 2012 business groups and health care companies on record opposing the measure had donated more than $1.2 million to the California Democratic Party. Those same groups had also donated more than $1.5 million to Democratic assembly members including $82000 directly to Rendon. Rendon had also received more than $101000 from pharmaceutical companies and $50000 from health insurers. These same groups donated more than $2.2 million to the state Democratic party.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFoaXAub3JnL3Blb3BsZS9taWNoYWVsLXNoZXJtYW4tbWQtbWJhLW1zLWNwZS1mYWNwZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Sherman MD MBA MS,"



Previously Dr. Sherman served as executive vice president and chief medical officer at Point32Health the 20th largest health plan in the US formed in January 2021 by the merger of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Tufts Health Plan. Prior to that merger he served as chief medical officer of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care nationally recognized for both innovation and quality. His accountabilities included clinical innovation medical policy quality including regulatory and accreditation activities health equity and oversight of all physician functions (including provider engagement medical cost management utilization management and employer engagement). He has been widely recognized as a pioneer in bringing advances in transformational therapeutics precision medicine and digital therapeutics to Point32Health’s members by launching structured pilots that balance access and affordability and also generate real world evidence.

His leadership in the development of value-based payment agreements with pharmaceutical companies which tie payment for a drug to patient outcomes has placed him at the forefront of the issue and Dr. Sherman is credited with cementing Harvard Pilgrim’s position as a leader among insurers in crafting agreements with pharmaceutical companies that tie payments for a drug to its performance. In 2018 he received Xconomy’s “Contrarian Award” for his contributions including having signed the nation’s first such payment model for a gene therapy helping pave the way for developing innovative financing models. Dr. Sherman’s work is also featured in a Harvard Business School case study published in 2021. He has also led the nation to expand access to precision medicine such as whole genome screening and his organization became the first health plan to cover the GRAIL Galleri Multi-Cancer Early Detection Blood Test for a subset of its commercial members in 2022.

Dr. Sherman is a past chair of the Board of Managers of the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute which encompasses the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School—the nation’s only appointing medical school department based in a health plan. He holds additional board appointments with several well-respected nonprofit organizations including the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) the Personalized Medicine Coalition the Harvard Business School Healthcare Initiative and NEHI (Network for Excellence in Health Innovation). He is also a past chair of AHIP’s CMO Leadership Council a trade association comprising chief medical officers from health plans throughout the United States and previously served as a board member and as Co-President of the Harvard Business School Healthcare Alumni Association. Dr. Sherman has also served as a mentor for emerging physician executives enrolled in the AHIP Executive Leadership Program.

Prior to joining Harvard Pilgrim in 2011 Dr. Sherman served as corporate medical director for physician strategies at Humana. He also served as vice president of network and consumer solutions for UnitedHealth Group’s subsidiary Ingenix (now part of Optum) and as chief business development officer for United’s Medicare Part D business. Formerly Dr. Sherman held the position of vice president and general manager at Thomson Medstat (now part of IBM Watson Health) and he previously held management roles at Immusol a San Diego-based biotechnology company; HealthAllies an organization created to provide discretionary medical benefits to the cash-pay market which by UnitedHealth Group purchased; and Da Vita a national provider of dialysis services.

Before pursuing an M.B.A. at Harvard Business School Dr. Sherman received his M.D. from Yale and practiced as a cardiac anesthesiologist. He also holds a B.A. in Anthropology and Natural Sciences and an M.S. in Biomedical Anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Sherman is a diplomate of the American Board of Anesthesiology and the American Board of Medical Management. In 2009 he was named a fellow of the American College of Physician Executives in recognition of his national contributions to the field of medical management. Dr. Sherman frequently speaks at regional national and international conferences and lectures as a faculty member of Harvard Medical School’s Department of Population Medicine. He has also been called upon to provide legislative testimony at the national level. Speaking at the White House in 2017 Dr. Sherman presented Harvard Pilgrim’s efforts to combat the opioid epidemic at a meeting of the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. He has also delivered congressional briefings on precision medicine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yOS9wbGVhc2UtbWFrZS1hLWR1bWItY2FyL9IBPWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yOS9wbGVhc2UtbWFrZS1hLWR1bWItY2FyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Please make a dumb car,"Today’s cars are dumb where they should be smart and smart where they should be dumb. Enough already. Make a car that’s pretty much all dumb and watch it sell — because what automakers are giving people is so bad they’ll pay more to have less of it.

Cars now are like budget smartphones with wheels: loaded with bloatware unintuitive and slow to operate. Carmakers have always struggled with user interfaces but until recently the biggest problem we had was “too many knobs.” How I long for those days!

The proliferation of touchscreens and LCDs has made every car feel like a karaoke booth. Animations show reclaimed energy from braking the speedometer changes color as you approach the limit the fan speed and direction is under three menus. And besides being non-functional these interfaces are even ugly! The type the layouts and animations scream “designed by committee and approved by someone who doesn’t have to use it.”

Not to mention the privacy and security concerns. I was dubious the first time I saw a GPS in a car my mom’s old RX300 about 20 years ago. “Yeah… that’s how they get you” I thought. And now Teslas with missed payments drive themselves to be impounded. Welcome to the future — your car is a narc now!

The final indignity is that these features are being sold as upscale not downmarket options. Screens are so cheap that you can buy a few million and use them everywhere for everything and tell buyers “enjoy the next generation of mobility!” But in reality it’s a cost-saving measure that cuts down on part numbers and lets your dashboard team kick the can down the road as often as they want. You know this for sure because high-end models are going back to knobs and dials for that “premium feel.”

So here’s what I would like: a dumb car. This is what I think that looks like.

Dare to be stupid

First of all: no screens whatsoever. This is for a couple reasons both practical and aesthetic.

Practically speaking nearly all of what these screens do is already performed by smartphones. There’s no need for a deeply outdated laggy manufacturer-branded Spotify or Apple Music app your phone does it perfectly already. Navigation similarly is handled perfectly by the phone. Both of these I need hardly add already work fine with voice commands too.

Not having GPS or data (or hidden microphones or cameras) also makes your vehicle feel more private obviously. Sure they can still get your phone but at least they’ll need to put a GPS package on your undercarriage like the old days if they want to track your movements beyond that.

For media an aux input does it all. Doubles as a charging cable and you could easily swap it out for different and new devices. Include a bit of smart cable routing and your phone can conveniently be mounted in a number of places around the cockpit — not that you should be looking at it or touching it (use your words). If you want Bluetooth I’ve got a dongle for you. The only thing the car should have is a volume dial maybe a three-button basic playback control cluster on the wheel.

As for the climate controls on those big center LCDs a couple knobs will do it. No one really believes these “zone” things work right? No car is big enough to have zones in it. A blue-to-red dial blower select and A/C and recirculate toggles get it done just fine.

In the instrument cluster we can have ordinary needle gauges. Speed fuel oil temperature and the usual idiot lights: check engine low tire pressure etc.

Aesthetically the digital versions of these have always bothered me. Drivers are meant to be focused on the road but these clusters often have distracting bright information that’s constantly changing. The difference between 69 and 70 on a gauge is an eighth of an inch just like the difference between 67 and 68 and 68 and 69. That continuous predictable variation is intuitive and precise enough for pretty much any driving purpose. On a digital display the numbers are blinky and big constantly drawing your eye as they dip from 71 to 69 numbers that look completely different and you can’t really check out of the corner of your eye.

Keep it simple keep it safe

Losing the media and navigation means we can do without a lot of the computation capability that goes into a modern car but we don’t want to go without it entirely. There are safety features introduced in the last few years that ought to be included on every new car smart or dumb. Traction control blind spot and lane exit warnings and even automatic emergency braking require a certain amount of CPU power and they should get it because they save lives. Backup cameras are one thing people may not want to go without (and indeed may be required in some cases) — but you’d be surprised how informative a basic proximity beeper is.

The engine itself is also far more computerized than in the old days. Unlike the computerization of the cabin however this has many positive effects such as improved mileage lower emissions better reliability and easier diagnosis for servicing. The exact level of electronics required for safe responsive pedals and steering are probably a matter of some debate but we can leave that to the experts.

I’m tempted to ask for manual window knobs and door locks but that would put us over the line into affectation (if indeed we have not already left that line far behind). We’re not trying to recreate vintage cars but to make a modern one stripped of superfluous technology. Power seat adjustment though that’s a luxury even today. Use the lever.

Note that nothing I’ve proposed is specific to gas-powered cars; electric vehicles are just as prone to these bad decisions as the rest. This isn’t about nostalgia but rather abandoning a pernicious yet universally followed design philosophy. (…Okay it is a little about nostalgia but only a little.)

Of course what I’m describing despite its seeming simplicity probably amounts to something like a luxury vehicle in that it’s not aiming at minimizing cost. Nearly every existing car line is designed with the “latest” tech in mind and to do away with that is a major departure from existing molds assembly work QA and so on. Plus while I think the concept would attract many it still wouldn’t outsell much. It’s a niche vehicle for sure and the price would reflect that.

Still all I want is a car that isn’t as overbearing as all the rest of the devices I already own sending me notifications dinging reporting errors asking permissions needing updates — my god! Leaving aside the whole spurious “back in my day” argument there simply isn’t much point to these features now certainly not enough to justify their prominence or poor quality. Let’s see what it’s like to make a car that focuses on letting the driver drive and accommodating rather than trying to replace the supercomputers we all carry around in our pockets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzQ4MjgxOC9hZnRlci10aGUtYmxpenphcmQtdGhlLWVhc3QtY29hc3QtZGlncy1vdXQtdW5kZXItc3Vubnktc2t5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After the blizzard the East Coast digs out under sunny sky,"BOSTON (AP) — The sun shone down on much of the East Coast on Sunday a day after a vicious nor’easter brought blizzard conditions to many areas and left more than 100000 customers without power for a stretch that could last into Monday.

Winds that had gusted to more than 80 mph on Saturday died down on Sunday and temperatures climbed into the upper teens and 20s as people emerged from their homes to dig out.

The storm dumped snow from Virginia to Maine but Massachusetts bore the brunt of the fury with the neighboring towns of Sharon and Stoughton getting more than 30 inches (76 centimeters) of snow before the storm moved out.

More than 100000 lost power at the height of the storm mostly in Massachusetts. The outages in Massachusetts had dropped to about 40000 by Sunday afternoon mostly on hard hit Cape Cod. No other states reported widespread outages.

Utility Eversource said Sunday it had 1700 crews working to restore electricity in Massachusetts and customers will have their power back on “by the end of the day Monday with most before then.”

“We know how challenging it is for our customers to be without power especially in this frigid weather” Eversource Vice President for Electric Operations Bill Ritchie said in a statement.

In and around New York City snow totals ranged from a few inches in some areas north and west of the city to more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) in Islip on Long Island according to the National Weather Service. Warren Rhode Island got more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) and Norwich Connecticut finished with 22 inches (56 centimeters). Some areas of Maine and New Hampshire also received more than a foot.

Winds gusted as high as 83 mph (134 kph) on Cape Cod. It scoured the ground bare in some spots and piled the snow into huge drifts in others. Coastal towns flooded with wind and waves battering North Weymouth south of Boston flooding streets with a slurry of frigid water according to video posted on social media. Other videos showed a street underwater on Nantucket and waves crashing against the windows of a building in Plymouth.

A Rhode Island couple got married as planned Saturday during the blizzard according to broadcast reports. Sally Faulkner and Adam Irujo had been planning a wedding for 14 months so they went through with the nuptials on the steps of the Providence Public Library in front of a few family and friends.

Forecasters watched closely for new snowfall records especially in Boston. The Boston area’s modern snowfall record for a winter storm is 27.6 inches (70 centimeters) set in 2003.

The city tied its record for biggest single-day snowfall on Saturday with 23.6 inches (60 centimeters) the National Weather Service said.

Like most major winter storms in New England it drew comparisons to the infamous Blizzard of ’78 which paralyzed the region for days.

“I was around for the Blizzard of ’78 and this one was worse. The wind was tremendous” Joe Brescia 72 said Sunday tears streaming down his face from the bitter cold as he shoveled his sidewalk in Warwick Rhode Island.

Bao Ha 26 didn’t think it was that bad until he went outside to shovel Sunday morning.

“It’s funny it didn’t look so bad when I looked out the window this morning” he said as he shoveled the sidewalk in front of his home in Waltham outside Boston which according to the National Weather Service got 16 inches (40 centimeters) of snow. “But it’s light so it’s easy to shovel.”

Climate change particularly the warming ocean probably influenced the strength of the storm atmospheric researchers said.

Much warmer ocean waters “are certainly playing a role in the strengthening of the storm system and increased moisture available for the storm” said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. “But it isn’t the only thing.”

The storm had two saving graces: Dry snow less capable of snapping trees and tearing down power lines and its timing on a weekend when schools were closed and few people were commuting.

Parts of 10 states were under blizzard warnings at some point: Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island Connecticut New York and New Jersey along with much of the Delmarva Peninsula in Delaware Maryland and Virginia.

The National Weather Service considers a storm a blizzard if it has snowfall or blowing snow as well as winds of at least 35 mph (56 kph) that reduce visibility to a quarter-mile or less for at least three hours. In many areas Saturday’s storm met those criteria.

Now as California lawmakers once again get close to establishing such a program all eyes are on Newsom to see how he will come down on the issue — and whether the millions he and his party received from health insurance industry donors will convince him to abandon the cause he previously touted. A new bill would move to replace the state’s private insurance market with a public system in which the government is the single-payer for health care services. Due to the rules of the state’s legislature the bill must pass the state’s full assembly by the end of the day Monday or it’s dead for another year. As the Democratic governor Newsom has significant influence over what the Democratic legislature sends to his desk — but he has remained publicly aloof about the bill implying he may block it as his industry donors mount an opposition campaign. “Governor Newsom has no choice but to sign a bill and put it on the ballot as he’s promised he wants to” says Jamie Court president of the consumer and taxpayer advocacy group Consumer Watchdog. “I don’t think he can get out of that promise.”

A Long Battle The current legislation AB 1400 would establish a new agency called CalCare that would pay for basic medical services in the state. If it passes Californians would then vote on whether to approve a tax increase to fund the program — a vote that might not happen until 2024. The legislation is opposed by a variety of business interests including the California Chamber of Commerce the National Federation of Independent Business and health insurers. “I have not had the opportunity to review that plan and no one has presented it to me” Newsom recently said of the legislation. “I think that the ideal system is a single-payer system. I’ve been consistent with that for well over a decade. . . . The difference here is when you are in a position of responsibility you’ve gotta apply you’ve gotta manifest the ideal. This is hard work. It’s one thing to say it’s another to do.” California already has near-universal health insurance coverage thanks to incremental extensions of coverage for undocumented immigrants through the state’s Medicaid program Medi-Cal and subsidies from the Affordable Care Act. In January Newsom announced that his new budget which would extend Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented immigrants of any age would make California the first state to achieve universal coverage. “I campaigned on universal health care” Newsom declared the day after announcing his plan. “We’re delivering that.” In achieving near-universal coverage through private markets however the governor appears to be pivoting away from single-payer. The state has been down this road many times before going as far back as 1918 when voters rejected an effort to create a state health care program for the poor. Single-payer legislation finally made it out of committee in 1992 after Democratic governor Jerry Brown endorsed it during a Democratic presidential primary debate that year — but the effort ultimately failed in the state senate. Then in 1994 the California Nurses’ Union pushed Prop 186 to establish single-payer in the state but the measure was overwhelmingly defeated following a campaign by a coalition of business groups insurance companies and hospitals. While state lawmakers succeeded in passing single-payer legislation in 2006 Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill when it arrived at his desk — and vetoed an amended version of the legislation two years later. In 2017 when single-payer came up again in California it appeared more likely to pass. The state had already dramatically expanded health care coverage in response to the Affordable Care Act Democrats held supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature and Brown had once again been elected governor. At the same time polling showed most Californians supported the creation of a taxpayer-funded universal health care system. The tide seemed to be turning nationally as well. The presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders (Ind-VT) had exposed mainstream America to the concept of Medicare For All and twenty-seven members of California’s congressional delegation had signed onto a federal Medicare For All bill. Newsom the lieutenant governor at the time even made single-payer health care a plank of his campaign. Yet once again the reform efforts were stymied when Democratic assembly speaker Anthony Rendon refused to hold a vote on the bill for the duration of the year even though it had already passed the senate. According to Rendon he did so because “there are potentially fatal flaws in the bill including the fact it does not address many serious issues such as financing delivery of care cost controls or the realities of needed action by the Trump administration and voters need to make [it] a genuine piece of legislation.” But there was likely another reason the bill died: big business had stepped in to quash it. As International Business Times reported at the time since 2012 business groups and health care companies on record opposing the measure had donated more than $1.2 million to the California Democratic Party. Those same groups had also donated more than $1.5 million to Democratic assembly members including $82000 directly to Rendon. Rendon had also received more than $101000 from pharmaceutical companies and $50000 from health insurers. These same groups donated more than $2.2 million to the state Democratic party.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vY2FsaWZvcm5pYWdsb2JlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9pcy10aGVyZS1hLWRvY3Rvci1pbi10aGUtaG91c2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is There a Doctor in The House? – California Globe,"Consider that the better question may be “Is there a decent doctor in the house?”

The Medical Board of California has recently asked the State Legislature to amp up the ability to discipline doctors who have run afoul of the system. Included in the request was a petition asking for lowering the burden of proof standards for bad doctor prosecutions while at the same time increasing medical licensing fees the primary source of revenue for the State Board.

So what is driving these and other requests for reform? Assertions have been made that the Medical Board has been too lenient with doctors accused of malpractice or worse.

Perhaps though there is reason to ask whether California and other states are now finding that the profession that historically attracted our best and brightest is failing to do so for good reasons.

Studies and reports are showing that the nation will experience a significant shortage of physicians in the coming years primarily due to an expanded need to serve an aging population with greater life expectancies. For the time being applications to medical schools are increasing but the capacity to admit them to U.S. schools has not which forces lesser qualified applicants to train in foreign programs. But can we realistically expect our best and brightest to seek a career in medicine moving forward? Consider:

As with most post high school education the cost of attending medical school continue to skyrocket yearly to an average now of nearly $55000/year. While these staggering numbers reflect the cost of tuition fees and insurance they do not take into account the cost of living expenses. Ultimately a medical school graduate will leave school with an average student loan debt of nearly a quarter of a million dollars.

While these staggering numbers reflect the cost of tuition fees and insurance they do not take into account the cost of living expenses. Ultimately a medical school graduate will leave school with an average of nearly a quarter of a million dollars. After graduating medical school the loan repayment begins but the training does not end. Post-doctoral residency programs will last between 3 to 7 years and the average resident compensation will average around $60000/year—hardly making the new doctor a 1 percenter.

will average around $60000/year—hardly making the new doctor a 1 percenter. After enjoying relative stability for a decade or so medical malpractice insurance premiums are on the rise again….precipitously. Whereas doctors in Los Angeles County tend to experience lower premiums relative to other metro areas in the U.S. the overall numbers can be daunting. Depending upon specialty and geographic location of practice premiums can range from approximately $7500/year to well past $200000/year. This can account for 3-4% of a doctor’s income.

Depending upon specialty and geographic location of practice premiums can range from approximately $7500/year to well past $200000/year. This can account for 3-4% of a doctor’s income. Aside from financial issues associated with the costs of education and establishment of a medical practice there are certainly other stresses that might make a prospective physician think twice before entering the field and most definitely causing the doctor to look back after choosing a career in medicine and lament that choice. A 2019 American Federation of Family Physician (AFFP) survey indicates that 39% of physicians would not choose a career in medicine if given the choice again. The survey further cited that the greatest source of unhappiness in their medical practice were a lack of control and clerical burdens. There can be no doubt that the influence of managed care insurance and the corporatization of health care directly contribute to these particular leaders in unhappiness.

Perhaps the most important if not startling development of late is proposed Assembly Bill 1400 authored by Assemblyman Ash Kalra (D- San Jose) which would ultimately establish CalCare a first-in-the-nation single-payer state universal health care system. The plan would be funded by the largest tax increase in California history through a state constitutional amendment ultimately needing approval of California voters.

Not surprisingly influential organizations such as the California Medical Association and California Hospital Association are highly critical of the proposal. While the merits of this monumental proposal which would have government assume control of roughly 10% of the California economy require significant exploration and debate for now it is reasonable to consider whether a purely government run state health care system will attract the best and most competent physicians to California in a time where doctor shortages are projected and the Medical Board of California is finding a need to amp up their ability to root out and prosecute less than adequate doctors.

As a California taxpayer but perhaps more importantly as a California patient or future patient the debate centered around Assembly bill 1400 and a potential referendum to amend the State Constitution merit continuing scrutiny.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbXJvLndoby5pbnQvc29tYWxpYS9uZXdzL2ZvcmdvdHRlbi1kaXNlYXNlcy1hY2hpZXZpbmctaGVhbHRoLWVxdWl0eS10by1lbmQtdGhlLW5lZ2xlY3Qtb2YtcG92ZXJ0eS1yZWxhdGVkLWRpc2Vhc2VzLWluLXNvbWFsaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forgotten diseases: Achieving health equity to end the neglect of poverty-related diseases in Somalia,"A technical officer from the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean Dr Mona Osman after a discussion with patients. Credit: WHO30 January 2022 – In May 2021 the World Health Assembly resolved to dedicate 30 January each year as World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day to shed light on the public health challenge that neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) pose in countries such as Somalia. This came about as a result of lobbying from the United Arab Emirates to galvanize support for communities suffering without enough support particularly as other disease control initiatives gain more attention. This year the theme for World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day is ‘Achieving health equity to end the neglect of poverty-related diseases.’

Prevalence of NTDs in Somalia

NTDs are known to be ‘neglected’ owing to the lack of attention they receive including from the donor community policy-makers and stakeholders. The NTDs in Somalia are a consequence and cause of poverty as they thrive where access to clean water sanitation and health care is limited. They affect the poorest most marginalized communities particularly children women and the elderly and those who lack access to basic needs like clean water. In Somalia they impact communities living in rural and remote settings and the outskirts of big towns. These diseases cause immeasurable suffering and prevent adults from being able to work and children from being able to go to school.

Of the 20 NTDs listed by WHO as endemic in tropical countries the most prevalent in Somalia are: leprosy schistosomiasis soil-transmitted helminthiases and visceral leishmaniasis. About 5 to 6 million people in the country live in areas that are highly endemic for these NTDs. On the occasion of World Neglected Tropical Disease Day WHO and its partners renew their call to address the health inequity that is the main driver for people suffering from NTDs to access quality health care and as a result these ancient diseases continue to thrive and impact health and productivity.

Somalia a global priority for leprosy control

In 2019 as Somalia was one of 16 countries reporting more than 1000 new cases of leprosy the WHO Global Leprosy programme classified it as a global priority country. Even before this though the Federal Ministry of Health and Human Services had been working to respond to this disease. In August 2015 the Ministry of Health established an NTD section after which the detection of new leprosy patients improved and increased from 107 in 2015 to 2638 in 2021 despite a global drop in cases reported and detected in 2020 due to the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The overall increase in detection of new leprosy cases in Somalia is also linked to support received from the Nippon Foundation which has been supporting Somalia for the last several years to conduct outreach and raise awareness around leprosy enhance screening of patients and support leprosy patients with treatment so they are non-infectious.

Lack of awareness leads to social exclusion

Culimo shares her experiences of living with leprosy also known as Hansen’s disease Credit: Ali Abdi IsackAt the age of 19 Culimo Osmal Hilowle contracted leprosy – a disease that she didn’t know much about – despite having no memory of how she got infected. Even though she didn’t have any physical disability she started to present with sores on her skin.

“Everyone I know was afraid I would spread this disease to them” Culimo says. “They isolated me. At some point I even started to believe that I had a mental disability but once I started to receive treatment I knew I couldn’t infect anyone and felt much better as I integrated into the society again.”

Culimo owns a small shop where she sells vegetables every day to support her 2 boys alongside her husband.

Leprosy can be treated cured and stopped if it is detected in good time. “It would be good for more people to learn about forgotten diseases like leprosy. Now that people around me know more about the disease they treat me well and support me.”

Additional resources needed to fight NTDs and increase health equity

Besides leprosy it is estimated that 9 of the most endemic regions for NTDS in Somalia are also affected by visceral leishmaniasis. For several years there have only been 3 main treatment centres situated in two regions of Bakool and Bay and supported by WHO with capacity-building and medicines that provide services to support patients suffering from visceral leishmaniasis. Most patients who come in with this disease are from rural areas where they may have limited access to health services. Even though the local communities in these locations in collaboration with international and local nongovernmental organizations provide support to address visceral leishmaniasis there is a need to have additional capacity to address NTDs like this.

In 2016 a study noted that most schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminth cases were found in the regions in the South West state of Somalia. In response from 2017 to 2020 WHO supported the Ministry of Health to offer medicines using mass drug administration activities. In 2020 WHO and the Ministry of Health offered medication to around 2 909 457 school-aged children and adults to protect them schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminth infections.

Taking measures to address NTDs

WHO Somalia is supporting the Ministry of Health to reduce the prevalence of NTDs by offering technical support mobilizing resources including medical drugs and increasing coordination between donors and the Federal Government of Somalia to fight NTDs. Key donors supporting the fight against NTDs include the Nippon Foundation the Government of Japan and The END Fund alongside support from the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean.

“In a two-pronged approach WHO is supporting the Government to respond to NTDs while also working to ensure all Somalis have equitable access to health services through universal health coverage” said Dr Mamunur Rahman Malik WHO Representative to Somalia and Head of Mission. “In the very near future WHO and the Government aim to develop the national strategy for elimination and control of NTDs running from 2022 to 2025 which will increase the capacity of institutions to prevent and respond to NTDs and support patients in a holistic manner no matter where they live. Our Country Cooperation Strategy 2021–2025 aims to ensure a healthy future for every Somali by accelerating the uptake and coverage mass drug administration through improving access to care which remains the main intervention for control of NTDs. However we will need more support from policy-makers donors and stakeholders to make this a reality.”

NTDs are strongly linked to universal health coverage (Target 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals). The WHO country office renews its pledge and promises on leaving no one behind. Providing access to health services and essential medicines for NTDs is an indicator of the overall success of universal health coverage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2hlYWx0aC9hLXVuaXZlcnNhbC12YWNjaW5lLXRvLWVuZC1jb3ZpZC1wYW5kZW1pY3MtaXRzLWluLXRoZS1hcm15cy1zaWdodHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A universal vaccine to end COVID pandemics? It's in the Army's sights,"Omicron the latest variant of COVID-19 has led to a surge in cases and hospitalizations raising talk of fourth booster shots and variant-specific vaccines. But what if there were a universal coronavirus vaccine that protected against omicron and all new COVID-19 variants?

At Wednesday's press briefing White House Chief Medical Adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci explained the term ""pan-coronavirus vaccine.""

Said Fauci: ""There have been five SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: alpha beta gamma delta and now the current omicron. And so obviously innovative approaches are needed to induce broad and durable protection against coronaviruses that are known and some that are even at this point unknown. Hence the terminology 'pan-coronavirus vaccine.'""

In a surprise twist it's not Moderna Pfizer or any pharmaceutical company that is leading the research into pan-coronavirus vaccines -- it's the US Army.

The Army recently announced that its pan-coronavirus vaccine the spike ferritin nanoparticle COVID-19 vaccine (aka SpFN) had completed Phase 1 of human trials. Publication of the results is expected in January depending on the completion of the official data analysis.

Dr. Kayvon Modjarrad director of infectious diseases at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and co-inventor of SpFN told Defense One ""We're testing our vaccine against all the different variants including omicron"" the strain causing breakthrough infections even in people who have received booster shots.

We'll share what we know about pan-coronavirus vaccines and the Army's COVID-19 vaccine including how it works and when it could become available.

For more learn about free at-home COVID tests why you shouldn't ""just get COVID over with"" mixing and matching booster shots and the difference between N95 KN95 and KF94 masks.

Why do we need a pan-coronavirus vaccine?

Fauci has touted the importance of a universal vaccine to protect against all COVID variants. At a White House press briefing Wednesday he stressed the ""urgent need"" for a universal coronavirus vaccine.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases committed big to that goal in fall 2021 awarding $36.3 million to three academic organizations -- Duke University University of Wisconsin and Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital -- to develop and research pan-coronavirus vaccines. CalTech also has announced good early results for its universal ""mosaic nanoparticle"" vaccine.

In a Jan. 11 advisory statement on the omicron variant the World Health Organization declared that ""a vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition is unlikely to be appropriate or sustainable"" and stressed the urgent need for a vaccine that offers long-lasting protection without boosters.

What is the US Army COVID vaccine?

The three COVID-19 vaccines authorized right now for use in the US take two approaches to preventing infection: The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA to build up immunity while the Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a harmless rhinovirus to train the body's immune system to respond to COVID.

The Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle COVID-19 vaccine or SpFN takes a third approach using a harmless portion of the COVID-19 virus to spur the body's defenses against COVID.

SpFN also has less restrictive storage and handling requirements than the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines allowing it to be used in a wider variety of situations. It can be stored between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit for up to six months and at room temperature for up to one month according to military scientists. Pfizer's vaccine requires an ultracold freezer (between minus 112 and minus 76 degrees F) for shipment and storage and is only stable for 31 days when stored in a refrigerator.

The Army's vaccine has been tested with two shots 28 days apart and also with a third shot after six months.

How does the Army vaccine work against COVID-19 and other coronaviruses?

The vaccines from Moderna Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson all target the specific virus -- SARS-CoV-2 -- that causes COVID-19. But Army scientists designed their vaccine to protect against future strains of COVID as well as other coronaviruses.

The Army's SpFN vaccine is shaped like a soccer ball with 24 faces. Scientists can attach the spikes of multiple coronavirus strains to each of the different faces allowing them to customize the vaccine for any new COVID variants that arise.

""The accelerating emergence of human coronaviruses throughout the past two decades and the rise of SARS-CoV-2 variants including most recently omicron underscore the continued need for next-generation preemptive vaccines that confer broad protection against coronavirus diseases"" Modjarrad said in a December statement. ""Our strategy has been to develop a 'pan-coronavirus' vaccine technology that could potentially offer safe effective and durable protection against multiple coronavirus strains and species.""

Watch this: What to do if you lose your vaccination card and how to never lose it again 03:00

When will the Army's COVID vaccine be available?

No date has been set. SpFN successfully completed animal testing and wrapped Phase 1 of human trials in December but it must still complete Phases 2 and 3 of human testing when its safety and efficacy is compared to current vaccine options.

Normally completing all three phases can take up to five years but the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic is speeding up the process. The Moderna Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for example were tested reviewed and authorized by the Food and Drug Administration over the course of one year.

What happens next with the Army SpFN vaccine?

According to a WRAIR spokesperson ""researchers have devoted their full attention to analyzing the Phase 1 data and writing a report of the results."" The report could come in the next few weeks or even months.

After data from the Phase 1 human trials is published Phase 2 and 3 trials will begin. There is very little information so far on when or how those trials will proceed or if the phases will overlap.

To submit yours for consideration please send to [email protected]. Please consider including an image to be used–either a photograph of you or something applicable to the letter. However an image is not necessary for publication.

Remember opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect that of Redheaded Blackbelt nor have we checked the letters for accuracy.

This termination was effective 1/1/22. Anthem and the UC System are working to assure anyone who was seen during the month of January have their visits covered according to their plans contract. Anthem and the facilities are working together to provide an opportunity to apply for continuity of care if someone is in the current course of treatment. This is a band aid for anyone who was unaware and did not/does not select a new health insurance carrier before Monday night. It is not a solution if you wish to have the UC System available for new health issues that may arise including second opinions.

As an agent I received no notice of the termination of contract or change in network. It appears members were not notified or given warning and an opportunity to make an informed decision regarding changing insurance carriers to maintain access to the UC System. Anthem members are just beginning to hear from UCSF that they can no longer accept their insurance coverage and the patients must transfer care. This has been shocking and scary for the people receiving that information.

For many in our community this is a devastating blow and certainly an unexpected event. Many folks enrolled in Anthem with the assurance that they had access to the UC System. I serve clients who routinely seek care within the UC System or would choose UCSF or UC Davis as their option for any specialty care health crisis catastrophic diagnosis. It is a loss.

Anthem has added the entire Sutter system to the Anthem Pathway EPO Network beginning 1/1/22. This includes Cal Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. While there are viable replacement options available for care outside of the immediate area we recognize that for many those options do not provide the reassurance they are looking for.

As an agent serving the north part of the state and representing an already underserved area with a severe lack of options I feel a personal and ethical responsibility to publicly share this information in a manner that will have a large and immediate reach. Had I had the information timely I would have shared it much sooner and certainly with my own clients in better format.

I have been working with Covered CA Anthem and the administration at UCSF to find answers as to where the fall through was. Unfortunately regardless of the answers it will not change the situation. What my office is advocating for now is Covered CA to provide an SEP (Special Enrollment Period) to Anthem members affected by and not notified of the network termination. There are no guarantees this will happen but there are conversation happening to explore that option and evidence of lives affected is being presented.

In conclusion if this affects you and you are attached to the UC Network your best option is to make a carrier change. The only other option in our area is Blue Shield which you will find to be higher cost at Silver level coverage and lower cost at Bronze level coverage. Any changes must be made by midnight on Monday the 31st.

My office is working tirelessly to make individual contact with the clients we were able to identify as most vulnerable and in need of immediate plan changes. We know there are many we are unaware of who wish to maintain access to care within the UC System. PLEASE reach out to me directly if you are a current client wishing to make a change before the deadline. If you are without an agent and need someone to help we are happy to assist. If you have an existing agent I recommend contacting them immediately to discuss your options.

An inspection in October revealed severe corrosion along the exact 22-foot pipeline section where the spill occurred yet repairs were delayed in compliance with criminally negligent federal regulations. The 42-year-old pipeline that ruptured is operated by Collins Pipeline Co. which is co-owned by the Valero and PBF Energy corporations both of which receive hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies yearly.

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reports that the diesel spill occurred in St. Bernard Parish near a levee along the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet Canal between Chalmette and Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge.

Despite Biden’s promises of implementing the biggest climate investment in U.S. history the state and federal government continue to serve oil companies. Bare-minimum federal regulations are responsible for this spill because they allowed the neglect of essential pipeline repairs. Nearly all oil pipelines leak; upwards of 350 oil spills occurred in Louisiana after Hurricane Ida alone.

“The recent spill in St. Bernard Parish is an abject example of Louisiana regulators’ cozy relationship with industry defined by a desire to facilitate and promote industrial activity rather than protecting residents and the environment” said Jack Reno Sweeney of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade — an organization which partners with and advocates for communities impacted by petrochemical pollution. Sweeney emphasized the “lack of immediate communication with those most affected local residents and workers in the seafood industry after the spill was discovered.”

The Associated Press reports that “most” of the spill was cleaned up yet only 50000 gallons one-sixth of the damage have been recovered.



The environmental impact



Oil spills damage the productivity and trophic structure of wetland ecosystems which provide essential ecosystem services including water filtration reduction of floods and shoreline erosion which are breeding grounds for commercially important species barriers from hurricanes and nutrient cycling.



More than one-third of the United States’ threatened and endangered species are found in wetlands. The high viscosity of oil clogs the respiratory systems and organs of marine and terrestrial species; recall the heartbreaking images of dying seals birds whales and turtles coated in oil following the 2010 BP oil spill.

When oil leaks into soil nutrient cycling is disrupted plants cease to thrive and water cycles become irreparably disrupted. Dangerous chemicals find their way into the food and water we consume even if spills don’t directly occur in agricultural areas. The 300000-gallon spill leaked into the Bayou Sauvage Wildlife Refuge which already suffers from soil damage due to contamination from illegal dumping pesticide migration vehicle emissions prior oil leakages and a nearby landfill.



Human activities have caused unusual mortality rates in amphibians of this refuge and the destruction of brown pelican nesting grounds and with this new massive spill further degradation is inevitable.



The human cost

When Louisiana’s wetlands are damaged the entire country suffers. Hurricanes become worse and worse when land barriers degrade; recall Hurricane Ida’s unprecedented excursion all the way to the Northeast United States and the destruction left in its path. Furthermore shrimp oysters crabs and other species of shellfish that breed in wetlands are seriously endangered by wetland damage disrupting our food supply.

This oil spill is another environmental catastrophe among many that have wreaked havoc upon the working class.



Other examples include the recent military-induced crisis at Red Hill in Honolulu where oil-contaminated drinking water caused major short and long-term health consequences the violent state-sponsored repression of Indigenous DAPL protestors and the petroleum refinery-induced cancer epidemic in Louisiana’s own Cancer Alley.



It is clear that the oil economy directly harms working and oppressed people as well as the planet.



The CEOs and bankers who continue to profit from the use of fossil fuels can afford to move to greenspace-filled neighborhoods far removed from industrial areas and environmental destruction while ordinary people are forced to suffer the health and economic effects of their actions.



For the earth to live capitalism must end

“The [spill] emphasizes the need to decommission all fossil fuel infrastructure — including the countless miles of active and inactive pipelines cutting across our wetlands and the Gulf — and initiate a full and just transition away from petrochemicals in the immediate future” Sweeney concluded.

The United States is the wealthiest country in the world and has more than enough resources to transition entirely towards clean energy. Drastic change is necessary to end drilling and reverse the environmental degradation the fossil fuel industry has wrought throughout the Gulf and beyond.



It is past time to start prioritizing long-term sustainability over short-term profits. Under the capitalist system despite occasional “green” rhetoric capitalist politicians will remain the puppets of corporations.

Ultimately a socialist economic model based on centralized planning and sustainable development must replace the current system of overproduction and waste at the expense of all life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndodWZjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3hhdmktdmFsZXJvLWktYWltLWhhdmUtYWNhZGVteS1nb2Fsa2VlcGVyLXdlc3QtaGFtLXVuaXRlZC1maXJzdC10ZWFt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xavi Valero: I aim to have an Academy goalkeeper in the West Ham United first team | West Ham United F.C.,"West Ham United goalkeeping coach Xavi Valero has set himself and the Academy Of Football the target of producing a goalkeeper that can break into the West Ham first-team squad.

The Hammers’ famed youth set-up has continued to create young stars in recent seasons with the likes of England international Declan Rice and full-back Ben Johnson leading the list of names that have not only been handed senior team appearances but have become regulars around the first-team set-up.

One only needs to consider the names who received senior debuts in the Europa League group stages as Dan Chesters and Sonny Perkins featured against KRC Genk and Rapid Vienna respectively while Freddie Potts and Keenan Forson came in for their respective debuts in the home match with Dinamo Zagreb in a match which saw no fewer than eight Academy prospects feature – including the likes of Aji Alese Harrison Ashby and Emmanuel Longelo.

With so many Academy prospects getting their opportunity in and around David Moyes’ side Valero is hopeful that his work with the Club’s goalkeeping department can produce a similar opportunity for one of West Ham’s young shot-stoppers in the not-too-distant future.

I hope that in a few years we can talk of a goalkeeper that has come through the West Ham Academy and can be part of the first team squad Xavi Valero

“When I first came here a few years ago aside from taking charge of first-team goalkeeping as the first-team goalkeeping coach I also looked at the last few years at West Ham” Valero told whufc.com. “We are the Academy Of Football and we have produced - and we keep producing - big players like Declan Rice Ben Johnson and others but we’re still perhaps lacking developing a goalkeeper.

“From that I felt that we should first put some effort into developing a proper goalkeeping department which works with the same ideas as the first team for the very young ages. It was important that the goalkeeping coaches can speak the same language and share the same principles of the game and that will aid the development of our goalkeepers.

“Add into that good recruitment and working to sign the best possible goalkeepers for the Academy.

“That was the idea and I hope that in a few years we can talk of a goalkeeper that has come through the West Ham Academy and can be part of the first team squad as a number one or two.”

West Ham’s commitment to the development of young goalkeepers was apparent this week as Krisztián Hegyi who joined the Irons as an U18 shot-stopper in 2019 penned a new contract with the Club until 2025.

The Hungary U21 international goalkeeper has become a regular starter in Mark Robson’s U23s this campaign but the Academy goalkeeping roster packs a host of talent ready to make the most of their respective opportunities.

Xavi Valero working with Darren Randolph Nathan Trott Krisztián Hegyi & Jacob Knightbridge during pre-season

Brian Kinnear featured between the posts for the U23s in Monday’s Premier League 2 contest with Leicester City with 17-year-old Jacob Knightbridge coming onto the bench.

Nathan Trott meanwhile is continuing his development on loan at French club Nancy starting regularly for the Ligue 2 side. The 23-year-old is the West Ham Academy’s most recent goalkeeping debutant coming on as a substitute in the 4-0 FA Cup fourth round win over Doncaster Rovers last January.

Elsewhere Joseph Anang spent the first half of this campaign on loan with League Two side Stevenage making 18 appearances in all competitions and has since joined League Of Ireland side St Patrick's Athletic on loan for the 2022 season.

Hegyi Trott and Knightbridge were invited by Valero to join the first team pre-season camp at St Andrew’s in Scotland back in July while Anang and Kinnear also have experience of working alongside the likes of Poland international Lukasz Fabianski and France international Alphonse Areola in training at Rush Green.

Valero knows that watching how the experienced first-team goalkeepers work on a daily basis is crucial for the Academy players’ continued progression and believes their integration into the squad on a regular basis will eventually lead to a regular first-team slot for at least one of them.

He added: “In terms of mixing these young goalkeepers with the first team goalkeepers we’ve been trying to do that in the last couple of years.

“This is another way of learning how to play the game and this exposure to the first team environment and watching from a close range how first-team goalkeepers give a certain solution to certain in-game situations is very useful and valuable.

“We have some good names – Nathan Trott Joseph Anang Krisztián Hegyi Jacob Knightbridge and other young goalkeepers too – so we have put in a lot of effort just trying to develop our own goalkeeper from the Academy.”",,,,,,,,,

(Foto: Twitter @SATMX)

Los fraudes se encuentran a la orden del día especialmente con la facilidad que algunas personas cuentan para falsificar documentos sellos o firmas oficiales.

En ese tenor el Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT) alertó de una supuesta venta de autos con la cual algunos delincuentes - empleando los logtipos del órgano - buscan engañar y estafar a compradores.

Mediante su cuenta de Twitter el órgano fiscal compartió una serie de fotografías del supuesto contrato y formulario de compra empleados en el modus operandi de este delito.

Para este caso los criminales captaban a las víctimas a través de publicaciones en la página (ya no existente) “www.satbc-gobmc.org” así como en el teléfono 01 (800) 024 0384 o el correo electrónico con una dirección falsa “compra.directa@satbc-gobmx.org”.

El SAT exhortó a denunciar el delito de falsificación. (Foto: Captura de pantalla)

Otra manera en la cual afianzaban la confianza era mediante la documentación en la que se anexaban de manera apócrifa los logotipos del SAT y el sello de la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público (SHCP) así como la firma de la directora Raquel Buenrrostro Sánchez.

En éste se establecían los términos y condiciones para efectuar la compra-venta; también se detallaba el supuesto número de operación y detalles de la unidad a adquirir la cual para la situación señalada tenía un costo de 75 mil pesos.

Esta cantidad resalta el papel debía ser completamente liquidada en un lapso no mayor a 2 horas a través de una transferencia electrónica a una cuenta de Scotiabank - dada de alta con el R.F.C “SHC850101U37″ así como a nombre de la Tesorería de la Federación.

Cabe señalar que en caso de lograr su cometido los pillos no sólo hurtaban el dinero de las personas engañadas también sus datos personales que éstas les proporcionaban tales como nombre RF.C y dirección completa.

Debido a la severidad del acto el órgano fiscal subrayó que no participa ni promueve la venta de bienes de manera directa por lo cual pidió divulgar los documentos así como denunciar el delito de falsificación.

SAT: Quiénes deberán presentar declaración anual 2022

El SAT tiene el objetivo de reducir los índices de evasión fiscal y de cobrar los impuestos de los contribuyentes con el fin de aportar a la riqueza del país y contribuir al gasto público. De esta forma algunos contribuyentes deberán realizar el proceso anual de declaración de impuestos.

Con el fin de evitar contratiempos y ser acreedores de multas los contribuyentes tendrán que realizar el trámite entre el primero y el 30 de abril en el caso de las personas físicas; mientras que las personas morales podrán hacer su declaración del 1 al 30 de marzo del 2022.

De lo contrario podrán ser acreedores de multas que van desde 12 mil 640 pesos hasta 25 mil 300 pesos. Además las personas que no cumplan con el plazo para presentar su declaración fiscal incurrirán en un delito de fraude fiscal.

De igual manera habilitó una serie de alternativas para facilitar el cumplimiento de las obligaciones fiscales tales como tutoriales en su canal oficial de YouTube enfocados en resolver las dudas de los contribuyentes.

Otra de las herramientas facilitadas por el Servicio es el simulador de pago de impuestos finales y definitivos que podrá usarse mediante este enlace.

""Si hay contratos con cláusulas de rescisión hay que estar preparado para que un jugador se quiera ir si se llega a la cantidad demandada"" apuntó en palabras recogidas por 'Goal' en 2011 el presidente de un Oporto que se ha especializado en comprar 'barato' y vender 'caro'.

Un negocio redondo en lo económico y en lo futbolístico que ha llevado a algunos de los mejores futbolistas del mundo a hacer escala en Do Dragao en la última década.

""No podemos adivinar qué pasará. Los jugadores tienen una cláusula de rescisión y si la pagan no hay nada que hacer. La intención del Oporto es quedarse con todos los futbolistas que creemos que son importantes y Luis Díaz viene destacando este año con la ayuda de sus compañeros"" señaló Sergio Conceiçao. Un deseo del entrenador portugués que no se ha cumplido en este mercado de invierno.

Las 10 mayores ventas del Oporto desde la 2011-12 Militao (Real Madrid 2019-20): 50 millones de euros Luis Díaz (Liverpool 2021-22): 45 millones de euros Mangala (Manchester City 2014-15): 45 millones de euros James Rodríguez (Mónaco 2013-14): 45 millones de euros Hulk (Zenit 2012-13): 40 millones de euros Falcao (Atlético 2011-12): 40 millones de euros Fàbio Silva (Wolverhampton 2020-21): 40 millones de euros André Silva (Milan 2017-18): 39 millones de euros Jackson Martínez (Atlético 2015-16): 35 millones de euros Danilo (Real Madrid 2015-16): 35 millones de euros

Fuente: transfermarkt

Los 45 millones de euros (más varios en variables que pueden llegar fácilmente a 60) que ha pagado el Liverpool por el extremo colombiano de 25 años le han convertido en uno de los movimientos más destacados de enero. En 2019 los 'dragones' lo compraron del Junior colombiano... ¡por 7 'kilos'! Han sacado 'jugado' deportivo y financiero a un futbolista cuya cuantiosa salida le ha colocado en el 'top' de ventas del club luso.

El doble de ingresos

En la última década desde la temporada 2011-12 el Oporto ha traspasado futbolistas por ¡823 millones! según datos de 'Transfermarkt'. En ese periodo apenas se gastaron la mitad (407) en compras. Un balance redondo en sus cuentas que ha tenido varios nombres propios. Y el que más 'kilos' dejó en la ribera del Duero fue Éder Militao. El Real Madrid pagó en 2019 la cláusula del defensa brasileño (50 millones) que apenas estuvo un año en el club tras llegar del Sao Paulo en 2018. El resto es historia.

Otro central le 'salió' muy bien al 'Porto'. En 2011 ficharon por 675 'kilos' a Eliaquim Mangala del Standard Lieja belga. Y en 2014 el Manchester City lo compró por 45. Lo mismo pasó con James Rodríguez (735 millones pagados al Banfield argentino en 2010 y vendido en 2013 al Mónaco por 45) Hulk (19 desembolsados al Tokyo Verdy japonés en 2008 y traspasado por 40 al Zenit San Petersburgo ruso en 2012) Radamel Falcao (54 al River Plate argentino en 2009 y 40 al Atlético de Madrid en 2011)...

Si hay contratos con cláusulas de rescisión hay que estar preparado para que un jugador se quiera ir si se llega a la cantidad demandada Pinto da Costa presidente del Oporto

Una tendencia que han seguido Fàbio Silva (40 al Wolverhampton en la temporada 2010-11) André Silva (38 al Milan en la 2017-18) Jackson Martínez (35 al Atlético en la 2015-16) Danilo (315 al Real Madrid en la 2015-16)...

En su cuenta de Twitter dio a conocer un oficio apócrifo que ha circulado en el cual se pretende engañar a los contribuyentes para que efectúen depósitos vía transferencia electrónica para obtener carros con precios accesibles para su adquisición.

¡Atención!

El SAT no participa ni promueve venta de bienes de manera directa. La siguiente información es falsa. Recuerda que falsificar documentos es un delito.

Detalló que mediante engaños se invita a las personas a pagar un carro en un lapso no mayor a dos horas posteriores a la emisión del supuesto oficio el cual promete al solicitante recibir dicha unidad vehicular de forma gratuita en su domicilio y con una garantía de tres meses por escrito.

Recalcó que esta dependencia no participa ni promueve en la venta de carros usados de manera directa dirigido a personas físicas y morales y mucho menos emite las bases que pueden ser consultadas en una supuesta página de Internet o acudiendo a las oficinas de la Administración de Recursos Materiales del SAT.

Carros y defraudación con oficios apócrifos

Explicó que los supuestos oficios emitidos por el SAT para vender carros hacen la advertencia de que “en el caso de desistir de la compra solicitada el solicitante será penalizado con el 10% del valor del total mencionado” además de que “no se podrá editar y/o modificar el presente oficio a menos de solicitar el cambio por otro bien siempre y cuando corresponda a la misma categoría.

Te recomendamos: Perseguir un sueño hasta alcanzarlo la historia de Dayana

En los últimos años la aromaterapia ha cobrado mayor fuerza en la sociedad que busca prácticas alternativas para mejorar su salud siendo Denis una de esas personas que quedaron satisfechas tanto que decidió comenzar a vender el producto.

“Mi negocio es de mercadeo de red me inscribí a Young Living porque mi abuelita no podía dormir entonces alguien me recomendó los aceites y los compré sin pensarlo y desde la primer noche que fui a su casa y le puse el difusor pudo dormir toda la noche completa yo de ahí ya creí en ellos y dije que no me lo puedo callar” contó.

La ingeniera industrial de profesión comenzó a compartir los aceites con sus amigas y familiares y luego de dos años formalizó su empresa y renunció al trabajó que tenía en una empresa minera.

Desde entonces comenzó sus ventas no sólo en Cananea sino en la mayoría de los municipios de Sonora además de expandirse a otros estados como Durango Querétaro Chihuahua Baja California e incluso en Arizona.

“Pensé que es un negocio que tiene mucho potencial que estás a tu tiempo a tu ritmo trabajas desde donde quieras no tienes que tener una tienda física nada más es ahorita las redes sociales que es lo que más se mueve” externó.

Aumento de ventas

Con la llegada de la pandemia por el Covid-19 en el 2020 las ventas de Do Oils se incrementaron hasta por cuatro veces comparadas a las de un año normal.

Denis adjudicó tal logro a que las personas comenzaron a invertir más a la salud y bienestar encontrando en la aromaterapia una buena alternativa.

Durante el 2021 la demanda siguió alta pero un poco más calmada que en el 2020 mientras que actualmente se encuentra estabilizada.

Gracias al trabajo realizado por cinco años Denis cuenta con una comunidad de clientes de más mil 700 personas.

“Tengo una empresa que puede estar en todo el mundo hasta ahorita yo creo que habrá una persona de Europa nada más pero mi plan es llegar a Brasil u otras ciudades de Sudamérica” aseveró.

¿Qué ofrece?

Dentro de los tipos de aceite que Do Oils ofrece está el de lavanda que es el más solicitado mismo que de acuerdo a experiencia propia y la de sus clientes cuenta con beneficios para poder dormir para la piel y la alergia.

También cuenta con aceites de incienso para la meditación aceites para estabilizar emociones en caso de ansiedad y estrés de menta así como los de vitamina C.

“Los aceites son extractos de las plantas de los tallos de las raíces de las hojas de cualquiera de estos tiene muchos beneficios” apuntó.

Asimismo la joven emprendedora mencionó que uno de los beneficios de comprar en Do Oils es que el cliente recibiría de regalo una aplicación móvil en el que se le explica cómo utilizar los aceites.

The company notes that customers who qualify for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) can use up to $30 of their subsidy to pay for AT&T’s prepaid plan making the 5GB plan free if the subsidy is applied.

In addition the carrier is also offering prepaid phones at a discount including the Motorola Moto G Pure for $19 (compared to $69) the Samsung Galaxy A03s for $29 (compared to $79) Samsung Galaxy A12 for $69 (compared to $119) iPhone SE for $149 (compared $249) and the iPhone 11 for $299 (compared to $399).

AT&T is ramping up its efforts to compete with lower-cost prepaid carriers. The company has announced a new unlimited prepaid plan that costs just $45 in the United States and it includes unlimited 5G data talk and text along with 10GB of data for hotspot use and HD streaming. There is however one catch…

As reported by The Verge the caveat here is that this new unlimited plan is only available through Walmart. Outside of Walmart AT&T’s most affordable unlimited plan is $65 per month and doesn’t include HD streaming.

As long as you can overlook the Walmart exclusivity this is actually a pretty enticing deal for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 users looking for affordable 5G connectivity. In comparison T-Mobile Metro’s prepaid 5G plan costs $50 per month Mint Mobile’s plan costs $40 per month Cricket’s costs $55 per month and Verizon’s Visible plan costs $40 per month. What sets AT&T’s apart is that it supports HD streaming unlike the other options mentioned here.

AT&T is also discounting its previously-available prepaid plans exclusively through Walmart:

AT&T is also offering its other prepaid plans at a discount if activated at Walmart. This includes its 15GB plan for $35 / month instead of $40 as well as its 5GB plan for $25 / month instead of $30.

And one group of companies looking to make breakthroughs are those that focus on gene editing which refers to a set of techniques that allow scientists to modify an organism's DNA.

Gene editing could help unlock therapies for illnesses that have thus far eluded the brightest scientists and one notable company in this field is none other than CRISPR Therapeutics. This clinical-stage biotech is currently working on several programs including three potential gene-editing cancer therapies called CTX110 CTX120 and CTX130. But the company's most promising candidate is CTX001.

CRISPR Therapeutics is developing this potential treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) in collaboration with biotech giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Both SCD and TDT are rare blood-related conditions that cause severe hardships to patients and have very few safe and effective treatment options.

Patients with TDT typically receive regular blood transfusions. CTX001 if effective would be a one-time curative treatment. It's not hard to see the potential here. In a clinical trial 15 patients with TDT were transfusion-independent after being treated with CTX001 with follow-up ranging from four to 26 months. These patients needed anywhere between 20 and 61 blood transfusions per year before the treatment.

Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics plan to submit CTX001 to regulators by the end of this year. This and other promising programs could end up becoming highly successful if approved. That's why the company has the chance to deliver 5x gains by 2030.

Of course there are risks involved. CRISPR Therapeutics could run into clinical or regulatory issues. But for investors with an above-average risk tolerance looking for biotechs with amazing growth potential CRISPR Therapeutics is worth serious consideration especially since its shares have significantly lagged the market recently.

An underrated biotech that has some big-name customers

David Jagielski (Maravai LifeSciences): If you're looking for a stock that can deliver 5x profits within a decade you'll want to focus on a sector where there's significant growth potential. And one of the most promising opportunities for a biotech company right now is in helping to develop messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines and therapeutics. According to analysts at Brandessence Market Research that industry is likely to grow at a compound annual rate of more than 28% until 2026.

One company that can benefit from that growth potential is Maravai LifeSciences. The biotech company makes products that are used in mRNA vaccines and therapeutics. In particular its nucleic acid production segment has been thriving amid the pandemic. For the nine-month period ending Sept. 30 2021 the company's revenue just from that segment alone has topped nearly $500 million -- a 288% year-over-year increase. That business unit alone now accounts for 87% of the company's top line compared with 69% a year ago.

And when you look at who the company's top customers are it's no surprise why Maravai is doing so well. COVID-19 vaccine makers BioNTech and Pfizer have accounted for 32% and 23% of the company's revenue over the past nine months respectively. Although that's a hefty amount of revenue for just two customers to generate it signals to investors that Maravai is a trusted company among some of the bigger players in the industry. It also leads to the possibility that down the road especially as mRNA development advances one of these companies may just buy out Maravai completely due to its low price and their familiarity with the business.

At a market cap of just over $3 billion Maravai wouldn't cost much for a top healthcare company to acquire it. And that's also one of the reasons it could potentially deliver 5x gains for investors. It's a lot easier for a mid-cap stock to rise in value than it is for a larger one especially given the exciting growth opportunities it possesses. Maravai looks like it could be the real deal and an underrated stock to hold over the long haul.

DNA with a twist

Keith Speights (Twist Bioscience): $3 billion. That's the annual market for synthetic DNA and next-generation sequencing (NGS) that Twist Bioscience is targeting. It's certainly an enticing opportunity.

Twist's market cap already stands at around $2.6 billion. For a company that made $132.3 million in revenue in fiscal 2021 it's a sky-high valuation. Obviously a lot of Twist's growth prospects are already baked into its share price.

However I still think that Twist could deliver a 5x return by the end of this decade. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock becomes a 10-bagger during the period. But it's not the synthetic DNA and NGS markets that make me so bullish. My optimism about Twist stems from another big market opportunity for the company that's only in its infancy.

An unbelievably huge amount of data is created every second. All of that data must be stored somewhere. And that storage is expensive at the high volumes we're talking about. Twist though is working on storing data in DNA. It's cheap. And DNA lasts practically forever.

Twist believes that the DNA data storage market could be worth around $35 billion per year. Granted Twist has plenty of hurdles to jump. If its DNA data storage technology is successful though the company doesn't have to come anywhere close to capturing all of the market for its stock to soar 400% or more by 2030.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now 35 years later a selection of these photographs will be revealed in Berkley Hudson’s new book “O.N. Pruitt’s Possum Town” published by UNC Press this month. Additionally the Columbus Arts Council will launch an exhibit Thursday.

Hudson is part of the group preserving the photographs which includes Jim Carnes brothers David and Mark Gooch and former Dispatch publisher Birney Imes.

Otis Noel Pruitt maintained a studio at 413 ½ Main Street. He was born in 1891 and his collection spans the 1920s to his retirement in 1960. He died in 1967.

Longtime Columbus residents may remember being photographed by “the picture man.” Indeed Hudson recalls seeing himself as a young boy in family portraits taken by Pruitt.

Pruitt is notable for his images of subjects across racial lines during the segregation era. Hudson elaborated on how this distinguished Pruitt’s work while acknowledging that Black artists would not have had the same opportunities in the following interview with the Dispatch.

To kick off the book and exhibit the Columbus Arts Council will hold a reception on Thursday from 5-8 p.m. and a panel on Saturday at 10:30 a.m.

On Feb. 17 Friendly City Books will hold a signing at 2 p.m. prior to Hudson’s lecture at Mississippi University for Women at 6 p.m.

The exhibit will be on view until April 23.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

Discovering the Pruitt collection in the 1970s

Mark [Gooch] got a youth grant from the NEH the National Endowment for the Humanities to do oral histories. … As part of that he ended up going up to Calvin Shanks’ studio which was Pruitt’s old studio.

[Mark saw] wooden boxes filled with negatives and asked what those were. He said that’s Pruitt’s negatives.

Mark showed it to Birney. Then they told me about it and showed it to me.

We weren’t able to persuade Calvin to let us buy them from him.

His family and his widow they sold most of the negatives to Billy Frates who had a hardware store on Main Street. We realized that’s where they’d gone and so we’d talk to Billy off and on for four years. Eventually he got tired of them.

That’s when we acquired them with the goal to preserve to research to exhibit and to publish the photographs. At that point though we had no idea the stories that we would uncover in the process.

The “viral” image of Sylvester Harris

There was a print of a Black man a farmer in overalls with his mule standing outside a farmhouse that had no caption no information.

The research that we were doing was all before Google or even hardly the internet at that point. I’m saying just showing pictures to people and saying “Do you recognize anybody?” Going around town and saying “Here’s a picture of a man with a mule do you recognize him?”

We discovered Sylvester Harris had a farm in the Trinity community on Plum Grove out in western Lowndes County in the prairie. He along with his brother owned the farm. They couldn’t make their mortgage payment to the Federal Home Loan Bank in New Orleans.

He heard the fireside chats from President (Franklin) Roosevelt who wanted to help the working man and working people. … After 90 minutes of calling the White House he reached President Roosevelt on the phone who told him that he’d help him save his home from foreclosure.

Right after that the Commercial Dispatch had a story and ran Sylvester’s picture with Jesse his mule on the front page. The Associated Press picked that up and Sylvester then went viral nationally.

His picture appeared in newspapers all over the country. It appeared in the Black press as well: the Chicago Defender the Pittsburgh Courier. Newsreels came from Memphis: Fox Movietone and Paramount.

Millions of people heard about Sylvester and his mule and how the president helped him save his farm.

That took me about 10 years to find out that story.

Executions and lynchings

Pruitt made pictures of two of the last executions by rope hanging in the country in the mid-1930s on the courthouse grounds here the Lowndes County courthouse grounds 1933-1934. John C. Stennis was the prosecuting attorney who would later become a U.S. senator.

Pruitt also photographed a horrific image of two men Bert Moore and Dooley Morton two young Black farmers from Lowndes County who were hanged after being accused of assaulting a white woman. They were taken to jail and then they were taken for — what used to be a term — “safekeeping” to another jail.

They were being taken to Aberdeen and the deputy sheriff was overtaken by a mob of three dozen white men who then brought Bert Moore and Dooley Morton to Columbus took them south of town and took them to a Black church yard and hanged them. Many people both Black and white ended up seeing those bodies there for a number of hours before they were cut down.

Crossing the color line

Understand that he was a white man working in a highly racial segregated society at that time and he was unusual for a white photographer in that he did document some but not all aspects of Black community life.

Now because he was a white photographer he could move into the Black community easily enough whereas if he were a Black photographer he wouldn’t have been able to move in the white community.

What he created was a body of work that allowed you to see with more complexity and more layers than a lot of photographers at that time aside from certain photojournalists like in the Farm Security Administration: Dorothea Lange Walker Evans Russell Lee Gordon Parks. They were doing a specific kind of thing at that time but Pruitt’s photographs compare favorably with some of those.

Pruitt’s approach to photography

He might only take one or two exposures of a picture. There are different reasons for that. Some had to do with economy saving money. But also it had to do with just the process.

He was making very sure about how he composed his image. The result of that is these beautiful photographs that he made. He made beautiful pictures of people with very dark skin and very light skin.

He knew how light functioned and he knew how it illuminated peoples’ faces or places and how then to expose for that whether it’s bright sunlight or dark shadow. And then he knew how to print for that situation also.

He wasn’t the only photographer in Columbus but he really was the only one who was out and about everywhere taking the range of photographs that he took.

The top-line $305 million figure gets headlines but taxpayers in the seven participating cities and towns would be on the hook for just under 60% of that or $180 million. The rest would be paid via a grant from the Massachusetts School Building Authority funded with tax dollars from across the Commonwealth.

Located in Taunton B-P serves Taunton Berkley Bridgewater Dighton Middleboro Raynham and Rehoboth. The proposal is to demolish the current cramped out-of-date B-P facility and construct a new state-of-the-art school building.

Municipalities would have to decide how to raise their portions. Each municipality has a different financial picture but one likely outcome is another vote by residents to take on debt beyond the state's statutory 2.5% limit. That option is called a debt exclusion. Some of the money could come out of each city and town's general fund. There are other funding options as well such as bonding.

'Feeding frenzy' and bidding wars?:Taunton-area housing market 2022 forecast

How to pay for it was the tricky question Taunton City Council President Phil Duarte sought to shed light on Tuesday by bringing in the city's top bean counters.

Impact on city services without a debt exclusion

Chief Financial Officer Patrick Dello Russo and Budget Director Gill Enos laid out the impact if the city tried to pay its share without seeking a debt exclusion.

That picture is dire.

In fiscal 2026 for instance it would add $4.2 million to the city budget. Offsetting an amount that high would require deep cuts to every category of city services. The numbers drew audible gasps from some city councilors.

""I appreciate the numbers"" said City Councilor David Pottier ""but we'd be boarding up City Hall fire stations because we can't make do on 25% less operating costs.""

Scare tactics?

City Councilor Estele Borges a key figure in the B-P debate given that she also represents Taunton on the B-P School Committee accused Dello Russo and Enos of making the numbers look frightening.

""There's been a lot of numbers that have been thrown out tonight and a lot of it to me is just a scare tactic"" said Borges a B-P graduate.

She highlighted that after the MSBA would pay $125 million B-P cities and towns would be responsible for $180M. Taunton's share of that would be 41% she said. That's roughly $73 million.

Enos said it was simply information.

""We're not for or against the project"" Enos said. We're just presenting the numbers.""

State will pick up 40% of tab

Municipalities will not have to lay out the entire $305 million before being reimbursed. Instead the MSBA would pay every month for more of a ""pay as you go"" approach according to the frequently asked questions section of the B-P site.

Voters get an up-or-down vote on the project on Saturday March 5. Polls will be open in the seven member communities from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. In Taunton early voting in person and ""no excuse"" vote by mail will not be offered. The deadline for residents to request an absentee ballot by mail is Tuesday March 1. Such requests can be made until noon on Friday March 4 in person at the Election Department office.

If all goes to schedule the improved B-P could open in September 2025 according to B-P. Phase 2 of the project — knocking down the old building and adding new athletic fields would be complete in spring 2026.

Tax bite

The district's project consultants estimated in a recent presentation that the yearly property tax impact on the average single-family home in each community would be over 30 years assuming an interest rate of 3.526%:

Berkley: $285

Bridgewater: $131

Dighton: $241

Middleboro: $178

She was one of the youngest skaters at the Berkley Ice Arena and Recreation Center at the time so another young skater decided to take her under their wing.

“Angie was the little skater and I was the big skater” said Candice Tamakloe who was 14 at the time. “We were also only two of a few African American skaters at Berkley and I had been skating there for a few years so I took her on as a little sister.”

Now Blocker-Loyd and Tamakloe have decided to take on all the young aspiring figure skaters as their little brothers or sisters.

On Saturday Dream Detroit Skating Academy (DDSA) launches the city's first female-owned figure skating academy. Currently DDSA is the only Black-owned figure skating club in the state of Michigan Blocker-Loyd said. The academy will be run by Blocker-Loyd Tamakloe and Crystal Stewart. It will provide classes for skaters with no experience all the way up to advanced skater. Things will kick off from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at the Adams Butzel Recreation Center-Jack Adams Memorial Ice Arena 10500 Lyndon St. on the city's west side near the Littlefield neighborhood.

“There has never been a skater at the national or international level to come out of the city of Detroit” Tamakloe said. “We want to bring that quality back into the city.”

That mission is stated clearly on the groups website dreamdetroitskate.com: ""Exposure facilitates many of our youth’s interests. Interests are the seeds that inspire dreams and dreams fuel our drive for success. Unfortunately figure skating is an opportunity to which few Detroit youth are exposed but Dream Detroit is working to change that.""

Launched to provide affordable and accessible lessons to low-income youths in Detroit the academy offers offers both group and private figure skating lessons to those ages 4 and up with skill-building opportunities starting from ""Learn to Skate"" classes to competitive and ice show performances. Two classes will be held on Fridays and two classes on Saturdays. More information and demonstrations will be available at the soft opening Saturday.

The Olympia Skating Club was the very first figure skating club in Detroit. It started in the 1940s and later moved to Bloomfield Hills after changing its name to the Detroit Skating Club.

In 1987 the Renaissance Figure Skating Club started at the Jack Adams Memorial Ice Arena.

“That’s where I started at when I was 9” Tamakloe said. “But my mom moved me to Berkley because my coach at the time said that if I wanted to go further in ice skating I had to go outside of the city.”

From there Tamakloe went on to skate competitively through high school. From there she skated through the junior level and tested through senior freestyle which is like the highest level in skating.

""That is basically the skaters that you see on television” she said.

Blocker-Loyd who also is the owner of Studio Detroit Dance Center in Hazel Park said that while she never made it to the senior freestyle level herself she too was a competitive skater as a teen.

However she said the thing she enjoys most about ice skating besides it keeping her in the “best shape of her life” is the freedom it gives her.

“I think for me it's just another outlet or sense of freedom"" said Blocker-Loyd 34. “And being able to express myself creatively … yeah that's really what it is for me. And it's just it's fun. It's a lot of fun to do.”

Eleven-year-old Jadyn Simpson said she agrees with Blocker-Loyd who she affectionately refers to as ""Coach Angie."" She has never had any figure skating experience before but is very eager to give it a shot.

“I just can’t wait to start ice skating” Simpson said.

At practice on Wednesday Simpson practiced some of the basic techniques on the ice. She had a bit of nervousness on her face when she first entered the rink but quickly overcame it.

“If Coach Angie and my cousin say I can do it then I can do it. I trust them” she said.

Blocker-Loyd says she tells her students who are afraid of falling when they are on the ice that it's normal. But just like with any other obstacle you have to get back up and try again.

“Skating is like life” Blocker-Loyd said. “So you know at the beginning just be prepared to fall a lot. But also be prepared to get back up. And as long as you're not afraid to fall you'll be fine.”

The purchase marks the largest number of FLXDrives placed in a single order for Wabtec and the largest investment in battery technology by a North American railroad.

The order will upgrade Union Pacific’s rail yard infrastructure and support its commitment to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“As an industry leader Union Pacific is pioneering a major application of battery power in its rail yards” said Rafael Santana President and CEO for Wabtec. “Battery power is an ideal solution to reduce the environmental impact and costs of yard operations. Using the FLXdrive in the rail yard can significantly improve local air quality as well as reduce noise by up to 70% for neighboring communities.”

Founded in 1862 Union Pacific Railroad is a freight-hauling railroad that operates 8300 locomotives over 32200 miles routes in 23 of the Western United States including Illinois and Louisiana. It considers battery-electric trains the most environmentally-friendly means to transport freight. The approximately 2.5-MWh locomotives are each powered solely by 7000 battery cells providing Union Pacific with a zero-emission solution for its yard operations.

According to the press release the ten FLXdrives will enable the railroad to eliminate 4000 tons of carbon annually from its rail yards which is equivalent to removing 800 cars from the highway. The new electric locomotives will be manufactured in the United States and the first units being delivered to Union Pacific in late 2023.

Union Pacific published its first comprehensive Climate Action Plan in December 2021 outlining its efforts to significantly reduce emissions within its operations. As part of that plan Union Pacific will reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 26% by 2030 and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Earlier this month Rio Tinto announced an order for four FLXdrive battery-electric locomotives to support suitable operations of the mining company’s rail network in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bulloch County 911 dispatched Statesboro and Bulloch Fire Departments to a fire alarm call at the Statesboro Walmart Supercenter around 7:00 AM on Sunday January 30 2022.

Walmart's management team followed safety protocols and evacuated the store when the alarm was activated.

When the first firefighters arrived on the scene they reported light smoke in the rear of the store near an employee break area.

Statesboro Fire Tower One positioned in the rear of the building near where the light smoke was discovered. Firefighters used the tower truck to access the roof and discovered two of the HVAC units were experiencing some issues.

They shut down these units and then used fans to clear the light smoke in the building.

There was no report of fire damage to the building.

Statesboro Walmart Supercenter employees and customers were allowed to reenter the building after firefighters cleared the building and determined it was safe. The store is now operating normally.

A Black law enforcement officer has sued Walmart after being mistaken for a serial shoplifter.

David Conners says he was shopping at a Walmart store in Fayette County Georgia when he was handcuffed by police who had been called to deal with a shoplifter.

“I ain’t never shoplift a day in my life. You got the wrong man” the corrections officer said he told police officers as they detained him to investigate the situation.

Mr Conners told Atlanta’s WSB-TV that the officers even showed him video of the shoplifter stealing electronics.

But they continued to detain him even after he showed them identification that he was a Clayton County prison corrections officer and he pointed out that he had tattoos on his arms.

“That is not me” he said he told security.

Mr Conners and his lawyer Terance Madden now claim that he was the subject of racial profiling.

“This is the very essence of profiling” said Mr Madden.

The officers who arrested Mr Conners told him he needed to be cuffed as he was “agitated” had the same build as the suspect and was wearing a mask.

“This could be anybody. I could have walked in there and it could have been me who got arrested” added Mr Madden.

Mr Conners was eventually released after officers spoke with someone familiar in the case who confirmed he was not the suspect.

“We don’t tolerate discrimination of any kind and take allegations like this seriously. We are not going to comment further on this pending litigation” Randy Hargrove a spokesperson for Walmart told The Independent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2Evd2FsbWFydC1pbnZlc3RzLWluLWluZG9vci12ZXJ0aWNhbC1mYXJtaW5nLXN0YXJ0dXAtcGxlbnR5LzY0MTM4NTkuaHRtbNIBbmh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC93YWxtYXJ0LWludmVzdHMtaW4taW5kb29yLXZlcnRpY2FsLWZhcm1pbmctc3RhcnR1cC1wbGVudHkvNjQxMzg1OS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart Invests in Indoor Vertical Farming Startup Plenty,"Walmart America’s largest goods store recently announced that it bought a share of the agriculture company Plenty.

Plenty specializes in vertical farming. In a statement Walmart official Charles Redfield said the partnership will help the company offer the “highest-quality foods at the best prices.” Plenty is based in San Francisco California. Walmart is an international company based in Bentonville Arkansas.

Vertical farmers praise their methods. They say vertical farming grows more food while using less water and land. The method also does not use chemical insect control. It also permits produce to be grown all year near transportation centers which increases the dependability of supply.

Walmart did not comment on the size of its investment or the financial terms of the deal. The company said a Walmart representative will join Plenty’s board of directors when the deal is completed.

Plenty is one of several companies in the fast-growing field of indoor farming. Other vertical farming companies include AppHarvest in Morehead Kentucky and Gotham Greens based in New York City.

The company Agritecture is a business advisor. It recently said at least 74 indoor farming companies were established around the world in 2020.

Plenty was founded in 2014. It has a vertical farm in South San Francisco. It also operates an indoor science research center in Laramie Wyoming.

Plenty is now building a center in Compton California. It said the project will be the world’s most productive vertical indoor farm. It is expected to open in the second half of this year.

Plenty said its vertical farming towers are designed to grow several crops on one floor in a building the size of a large store. Its systems include vertical plant towers special lighting and robots to plant feed and harvest the crops.

Plenty says its farms use one percent of the land that an outdoor farm requires. At the same time the farm can produce anywhere from 150 to 350 times more food per hectare.

Walmart said that under the deal Plenty’s Compton farm will send leafy vegetables like lettuce to Walmart’s California stores beginning later this year. Walmart said the vertical farms will add to not replace traditional farming methods. It added that the vertical farms will increase the food supply in a way that is good for the environment and that does not waste resources.

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1lcGFya2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ZsdW1lLzIwMjIwMS84NzQ2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,To Ear or Not to Ear? That Is the Disney Question,"To Ear or Not to Ear? That Is the Disney Question

What makes a theme park a Disney park? Is it the castle? The princesses? The other Disney characters and IP? The cast members?

How about all the people walking around wearing some form of Mouseketeer ears?

If you've spent any time on social media you've probably seen how people use Mickey ears - or let's be honest more often Minnie Ears - to send an immediate visual signal that they are coming to you from a Disney theme park. Disney has encouraged the trend by selling a wide and growing variety of ear-themed head gear though some devoted fans pride themselves on making their own ears for use when visiting Disneyland or Walt Disney World.

The ears first appeared as the head gear for the Mouseketeers on the original The Mickey Mouse Club television show in the 1950s. These are the classic ears - shaped black felt with two black plastic disks attached. In the parks fans could personalize the ears they bought by getting their name embroidered in yellow thread - something that used to be one of the great freebies in the parks but that Disney eventually made an upcharge.

Today it's rare to see the classic ears amid the sea of other options available in the parks and online. But it's even harder to go a minute inside a Disneyland or Disney World theme park without seeing someone wearing some form of Disney ears.

So... do you?

There is no wrong answer here of course. You do you. No matter your style you either can find a pair of ears for you on sale at Disney or you can find plenty of fans online willing to help show you how to make your own unique pair.

As someone who covers the Disney theme parks for a living you might think that I would have a large collection of ears for use whenever I visit the parks. And I thought I did too having gotten many ears from Disney at various press events over the years. But when I went looking around the house to find them I discovered that I have kept just two:

All the rest I have given away as I do with pretty much all the stuff I get from press events. I can't remember buying a pair of ears since graduate school when I took a spur-of-the-moment roadtrip from Indiana University in Bloomington down to Orlando and bought several pairs to bring back to my friends as proof that I had gone to Disney World for the weekend. (I had the ears personalized with my friends' names too which was free back then.)

And this is the only photo I could find of me wearing a pair of ears.

Yeah it's been a minute.

Disney ears provide a wonderful way for park guests to express themselves and maybe to stand out in the crowd. But I prefer to blend in and not draw attention to myself while reporting in the parks. (This is probably a horrible strategy for me professionally alas.) If you ever see a photo or video of me wearing Mickey ears consider that my secret signal to you that something has gone terribly wrong. Send help immediately.

Preferably churros.

What's your favorite pair of Disney ears either that you've had or that you have seen in the parks?

However as pandemic concerns persist some guests looking to visit the most magical place on Earth as safely as possible are opting to limit their dining plans to outdoor settings.

Many of Walt Disney World's most popular and heavily themed best restaurants and dining experiences don't have an alfresco option so even Disney World regulars are finding themselves in new territory with old favorites temporarily off their must-do lists.

When it comes to table-service dining at Disney World outdoor seating can be tougher to come by especially inside the theme parks. Quick-service restaurants will be your most reliable means to keeping your meals outside but there are some great spots to enjoy table-service meals outdoors during your Disney World trip.

We've rounded up the very best spots at Walt Disney World to dine outside prioritizing table service but offering some reliable quick-service options where table service is scarce.

Things to know about outdoor dining at Disney

The most important thing to keep in mind when planning for outdoor dining at Disney World is to expect the unexpected and have a backup plan. Central Florida weather is highly unpredictable. From winter cold snaps to extreme summer heat and thunderstorms Mother Nature can sometimes derail your outdoor dining plans reducing or even closing outdoor seating areas.

The good news — if you've booked a table-service reservation and the restaurant is unable to seat you outdoors they will waive the same-day cancellation penalty if you explain why you need to cancel at the host stand.

With limited outdoor table-service options across Disney our recommendations lean heavily on ""lounges"" which typically serve shareable small plates and great cocktails but may not offer a traditional kids menu.

Some of the most atmospheric spots to eat at Walt Disney World are lounges but they do require you to get a bit creative with your meal — especially if you're used to a traditional three-course experience on vacation. But with an open mind and an empty stomach you just might discover some new favorites on our list of the best restaurants for outdoor dining at Walt Disney World.

Best outdoor dining at the Magic Kingdom

Magic Kingdom is the lightest of Walt Disney World's four theme parks on solid outdoor dining options when it comes to both food quality and atmosphere. We wouldn't choose any of the options on this Magic Kingdom list over others outside the gates so consider hopping to another park or nearby resort if none of these picks strike your fancy.

Table service

Tony's Town Square Restaurant

For outdoor table-service dining at Magic Kingdom Tony's Town Square Restaurant is your only option and it's not always available. The ""Lady and the Tramp""-themed spot serves Italian-American classics such as spaghetti and meatballs Tony's pizza pie and fettuccine alfredo. While the food tends to receive below-average reviews from diners the outdoor patio is a lovely spot overlooking Magic Kingdom's Town Square area of Main Street U.S.A.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Seating on the patio is only available when the weather and staffing levels permit so swing by the restaurant when they open to find out if they'll be seating outside during your reservation. If they're not cancel in person at the desk (be sure to explain why and they'll waive your penalty fee) and default to your backup plan.

Quick service

Casey's Corner

There's nothing fancy about dining at Casey's Corner but it's hard to strike out with corn dog nuggets castle views and even some live entertainment from the Casey's Corner pianist. There's a hot dog for every taste and appetite from Walt's chili-cheese all-beef foot-long hot dog (say that five times fast) to the plant-based loaded slaw dog.

Be sure to keep an eye on mobile order return times — this spot can get very popular at peak times of day — then grab a seat under one of the bright red-and-white umbrellas for a home-run meal.

Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn & Cafe

Tex-Mex standards like fajitas nachos rice bowls and burgers are on the menu at this Frontierland outpost one of Magic Kingdom's best-rated quick-service spots. Pecos Bill's large outdoor seating area fills up quickly as do mobile order return times so don't wait until your crew is famished to place an order.

Cosmic Ray's Starlight Café

You won't get more theme-park basic than the menu at Cosmic Ray's but sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered — especially for picky eaters. Burgers hot dogs and chicken strips are served at this futuristic Tomorrowland spot where it's typically a breeze to get a fully shaded outdoor table.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Best outdoor dining at Disney's Hollywood Studios

Like Magic Kingdom Disney's Hollywood Studios is light on the outdoor table service but this is one park where quick-service belongs on your must-do list. In my book the best food at Hollywood Studios comes from a galaxy far far away in the park's newest land Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and there are a couple of other solid options — enough to keep you eating well outdoors all day.

Table service

The Hollywood Brown Derby Lounge

The only outdoor table-service option at Disney's Hollywood Studios also happens to be the lounge portion of our pick for best table-service meal in the park: The Hollywood Brown Derby inspired by the famed Tinseltown icon.

Join the walk-up list for a table outside at The Hollywood Brown Derby Lounge where you can sip classic cocktails like an Old Fashioned Paloma or Hollywood Manhattan and nibble lounge entrees like Brown Derby's famous cobb salad shrimp cocktail and BLT sliders. Feeling extra hungry? The full restaurant menu is also available to order from the outdoor lounge tables.

Quick service

Woody's Lunch Box

It's no surprise that kid-friendly comfort food rules the menu at Woody's Lunch Box in Toy Story Land.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Serving breakfast lunch and dinner families flock to this colorful all-outdoor space for its own takes on the classics. Everyone has their favorite but you can't go wrong with the BBQ brisket melt grilled three-cheese sandwich served with a cup of tomato soup for dipping or the ""Totchos"" an over-the-top tater-tots-meet-nachos concoction topped with chili cheese queso corn chips sour cream tomatoes and green onions.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Daily lunch box tarts (think delicious homemade Pop-Tarts) and breakfast bowls are great to mobile order and grab for a quick bite after rope dropping Slinky Dog Dash or nearby Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway.

Docking Bay 7 Food & Cargo

If you want more than the basics out of your theme park menu then the Force is strong with the menu at the main quick-service location in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. Just look for the food freighter docked on the rooftop of this hangar-bay-turned-restaurant where Chef Strono ""Cookie"" Tuggs serves some of the best quick-service fare at Walt Disney World.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Dishes like the fried Endorian chicken Tip Yip smoked Kaadu pork ribs and plant-based Felucian kefta and hummus garden spread may sound — and look — otherworldly but they're crowd-pleasers even for less adventurous palates.

The seating area feels peaceful despite being steps from the hustle and bustle of Black Spire Outpost's Marketplace and the Millennium Falcon.

Ronto Roasters

Also in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge Ronto Roasters is like an out-of-this-world shawarma stand.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

A pitmaster droid turns the spit roasting a side of ""ronto"" an animal native to Tatooine but it's pork on the menu in the classic Ronto wrap — roasted pork grilled pork sausage peppercorn sauce and tangy slaw wrapped in pita bread. (This is actually TPG travel editor Madison Blancaflor's favorite in-park meal at Disney World.)

For vegans and vegetarians grilled zucchini and smoky chickpea-onion slaw fill the plant-based Zuchii Wrap. This is also one of the best spots in the park for breakfast. Bright Suns as the locals say.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Tables here are all outdoors and fill up quickly but there's always a standing bar to belly up to as a last resort.

BaseLine Tap House

Closer to a traditional bar than any other spot on this list BaseLine Tap House still deserves to make the cut for a wonderful outdoor seating area (with a great soundtrack) excellent — though limited — menu items and an enticing lineup of California wines and brews on tap.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy) 0 1

BaseLine is a great snack stop but adults could easily make a meal out of the California cheese and charcuterie the coffee-rubbed rib-eye steak puff and the giant Bavarian pretzel with beer-cheese fondue and spicy mustard. This menu will keep hungry kiddos happy too.

Best outdoor dining at Disney's Animal Kingdom

What Disney's Animal Kingdom lacks in outdoor table-service options it makes up for with consistently awesome quick-service food throughout the park and some idyllic dining spots to boot.

Table service

Nomad Lounge

None of the table-service restaurants at Disney's Animal Kingdom offer outdoor seating but Nomad Lounge the more casual offshoot of Tiffins Restaurant next door might just be the park's best-kept secret. Join the walk-up list (no reservations here) and select an outdoor table for seating on the lounge's wraparound terrace overlooking the Discovery River.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Drinks here have a cult following. Try the Hightower Rocks made with tequila watermelon sweet-and-sour and lime juice or the Kungaloosh Spiced Excursion Ale Draft an African-inspired amber ale brewed exclusively for Walt Disney World.

Relax on the comfy wicker couches as you watch the passing character flotillas and refuel with small plates like the Togarashi-spiced tuna nomad bowl Impossible sliders with chipotle aioli and yucca fries and churros served with vanilla crema and chili-strawberry.

Quick service

Flame Tree Barbecue

Barbecue lovers should follow their noses (after mobile ordering of course) straight to this outdoor spot serving up smokehouse specialties like pulled pork St. Louis ribs and slow-smoked chicken. Even the plant-based option the Hot Link Smokehouse Sandwich is a crowd-pleaser topped with slaw crispy onions and mustard barbecue sauce and served on a pillowy housemade roll.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy) 0 1

If the food weren't enough of a draw Flame Tree boasts one of the most idyllic seating areas at any of the theme parks.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Sit alongside the tranquil pond or make your way down to the waterfront where — if you time it right — you'll get a front-row seat for a showing of Disney KiteTails the park's new can't-miss daytime show that launched in conjunction with Walt Disney World's 50th-anniversary celebration.

Satu'li Canteen

Satu'li Canteen is consistently ranked among the best quick-service restaurants at Walt Disney World — and for good reason. This spot located in Animal Kingdom's Pandora — the world of ""Avatar"" — is the perfect antidote after too many theme park meals of the fried fast-food variety.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 Satuli Canteen at Disney's Animal Kingdom. BROOKE MCDONALD/THE POINTS GUY 0 1

Fresh customizable bowls come with a choice of protein atop a hearty salad noodles rice and beans or red and sweet potato hash. Then top off your meal with a bright crunchy slaw and choice of sauce.

If bowls aren't your thing the steamed cheeseburger pods have a cult following too. Wash it all down with a bright green Hawkes' Grog Ale and a fan-favorite Blueberry Cream Cheese Mousse for dessert.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

The sprawling outdoor seating area is a perfect spot for taking in the sights and sounds of Pandora. Despite how popular Satu'li is it's usually easy to find a seat. We love mobile ordering Satu'li and timing it for pickup after a ride on Avatar: Flight of Passage which exits right at the entrance to the restaurant.

Best outdoor dining at Epcot

What the other parks lack in outdoor dining options Epcot makes up for in spades. Several table-service restaurants countless quick-service spots and rotating festivals all year make outdoor dining much easy to switch up here than at the other parks.

Table service

Rose & Crown Dining Room

This cozy pub in the U.K. pavilion includes plenty of outdoor waterfront seating overlooking World Showcase Lagoon. Just make sure you confirm your outdoor seating preference when you check-in for your reservation. A jolly good menu of British classics including top-notch fish and chips bangers and mash and shepherd's pie are best enjoyed with a proper pint or nip of scotch whisky and some sticky toffee pudding for dessert.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

For dinner and a show you can book a Rose & Crown Fireworks Dining Package ($89 per adult and $39 per child) which will get you a prix fixe meal on the patio during Harmonious Epcot's new nighttime spectacular.

Spice Road Table

Technically a lounge Spice Road Table in the Morocco pavilion is walk-up only but it's almost always easy to snag a table.

The open-air colorfully tiled waterfront space is gorgeous. Service is excellent and the small plates are consistently delicious. Menu standouts include the vegetarian Tiropitakia cheese-filled phyllo topped with cucumber-tomato relish plant-based pomegranate-chili crispy cauliflower spiced chicken and fried calamari. Don't be deterred by all the ""spice"" in the descriptions. Spice is used more to denote rich flavors than heat — most dishes are extremely mild.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Spice Road Table also offers a Fireworks Dining Package during Harmonious for $72/adult and $31/child for a prix fixe meal.

Via Napoli Ristorante e Pizzeria

Serving easily the best pizza at Walt Disney World Via Napoli in Epcot's Italy pavilion churns out authentic Neapolitan pies flash-fired in wood-burning ovens named after Italy's three active volcanoes.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

The food here is excellent but before you get too excited know that the outdoor seating is limited and very intermittent so it's definitely not a spot to count on for outdoor dining. As with other table-service restaurants that don't guarantee outdoor seating you're safe to make a reservation and put in your request to be outside. If they can't accommodate you you should be able to cancel without penalty in person.

Tutto Italia Ristorante

Like Via Napoli next door Tutto Italia doesn't consistently seat on the patio. When it does it's a solid spot for Italian classics like lasagne alla bolognese chicken parmigiana and cannoli and panna cotta for dessert.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

Quick service

La Cantina de San Angel

The Mexico pavilion has two dependable table-service restaurants but neither offers outdoor seating.

Luckily La Cantina de San Angel hits the mark nearly as well as its pricier table-service neighbors. Chow down on delicious tacos de pollo barbacoa or pescado empanadas con queso and nachos.

(Photo courtesy of Brooke McDonald for The Points Guy)

The shaded waterfront seating area also makes this a great spot to kick back for a mid-day snack. Cool off with a frozen mango or lime margarita and some guacamole with totopos (we highly recommend a side of their excellent white nacho cheese to complement any chips order).

Regal Eagle Smokehouse: Craft Drafts & Barbecue

Opened Feb. 19 2020 this barbecue haven brought a welcome update to quick service in Epcot's The American Adventure pavilion. Regal Eagle Smokehouse is a meat-lover's paradise with a menu inspired by some of America's most famous barbecue regions and traditions.

Choose from flavorful entrees like Memphis dry-rub pork ribs sliced Texas beef brisket sandwich Kansas City smoked half-chicken and North Carolina chopped smoked pork butt platter complemented by classic sides like creamy coleslaw macaroni and cheese and baked beans with burnt ends.

Katsura Grill

Steps from World Showcase's main thoroughfare is a tranquil escape that feels miles from the hustle and bustle of the park. Tucked away in a secluded elevated spot among the Japan pavilion's koi ponds and trickling waterfalls Katsura Grill serves sushi ramen udon and teriyaki.

Best outdoor restaurants at Walt Disney World Resorts

Walt Disney World's numerous hotels all feature outdoor seating areas in conjunction with their quick-service dining locations. Some of Walt Disney World's most popular table-service restaurants including the brand-new Steakhouse 71 at Disney's Contemporary Resort and Sanaa at Disney's Animal Kingdom also now offer a ""To Go"" service enabling you to Mobile Order and enjoy your meal outdoors or back in your room.

If you want to visit a resort dining location be aware that you'll need a dining or hotel reservation in order to park. Rideshares are sometimes waved through but technically require a reservation for dropoff. To visit a resort without a reservation use Disney transportation.

Trattoria al Forno Disney's BoardWalk

Just steps from Epcot's International Gateway entrance and the Disney Skyliner station Trattoria al Forno on Disney's BoardWalk has a handful of outdoor tables that you can request upon check-in. A new chef and updated menu earlier this year have elevated the restaurant's previously mediocre Italian fare to a place among the best at Walt Disney World.

Menu standouts at dinner include the shrimp pappardelle veal osso bucco and plant-based rigatoni bolognese that even carnivores agree is perfection. The equally popular breakfast menu ideal for a leisurely meal before heading into Epcot puts an Italian spin on the classics with highlights like tiramisu-style french toast and caprese omelet.

Take in the boardwalk's great atmosphere at an outdoor table. If you can't snag a reservation you can also order Trattoria al Forno to go and enjoy it at one of the many tables on the boardwalk.

AbracadaBar Disney's BoardWalk

A perfect spot for people watching along the Atlantic City-inspired boardwalk AbracadaBar is a magician-themed lounge serving a very limited but delicious menu of small plates whipped up in the Trattoria al Forno kitchen next door.

This hidden gem serves a Spanish tapas-style menu of small plates specialty cocktails and a wonderful selection of Spanish wines and cavas.

You could make a meal of shareable plates like the Spanish Charcuterie Ham and Cheese Bocadillo Crispy Artichokes and Tortilla Espanola. Or you could grab a drink and take in the sweeping views before heading over to nearby Three Bridges Bar & Grill for dinner alfresco.

Olivia's Cafe Old Key West

Lush tropical landscaping colorful buildings and a great soundtrack keep a nonstop vacation vibe going at Disney's Old Key West Resort. The original Disney Vacation Club Resort Old Key West is also home to one of Walt Disney World's hidden gem restaurants — Olivia's Café.

The restaurant serves island seafood dishes you'd expect from Key West such as crab cake and conch fritters but Olivia's is perhaps most famous for two Southern specialties: Olivia's famous grits at breakfast (one of the best on property) and southernmost fried chicken at lunch and dinner. Request an outdoor table in the sizeable outdoor seating area — and don't even think about leaving without having a Key lime tart for dessert.

Trader Sam's Tiki Terrace and Capt. Cook's Disney's Polynesian Village Resort

Trader Sam's Grog Grotto is one of the most heavily themed immersive dining spots at Disney and eating or drinking inside the famed tiki bar is a must when you're comfortable being indoors. However Trader Sam's Tiki Terrace the outdoor patio offshoot of the tropical watering hole is worth a visit in its own right.

A trickling waterfall lovely views of Seven Seas Lagoon with Cinderella Castle in the distance and (if you get your timing right) a live ukulele player or a showing of Disney Enchantment from Magic Kingdom make for a memorable evening on the terrace.

Grand Floridian Café and Gasparilla Island Grill Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa

Just a quick boat ride or 10-minute stroll down the walkway from Magic Kingdom Grand Floridian Café is a nod to the Victorian tea room serving breakfast lunch and dinner. Breakfast and lunch menus overlap with savory favorites. Try the lobster thermidor burger and fresh salads or breakfast classics such as steak and eggs and buttermilk fried chicken and waffles. All are available throughout the morning and afternoon. Outdoor seating can be requested at check-in but it's seasonal and typically only offered at breakfast or lunch.

If Grand Floridian Café isn't seating outside during your visit Gasparilla Island Grill is your best bet. The quick-service location around the corner has plenty of outdoor seating with views of Seven Seas Lagoon and Cinderella Castle and serves a variety of burgers hot and cold sandwiches pizzas and salads.

Enchanted Rose Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa

Another lounge for the win. This upscale ""Beauty and the Beast""-themed escape is dressed to the nines in elegant subtle nods to the film. Be sure to take a peek at the stunning main bar and cozy library before grabbing a spot on Enchanted Rose's heated patio.

Sip signature cocktails like the Lavender Fog Floral Bitter Beauty and rotating seasonal old fashioned. Then share small plates like flatbreads truffle fries and crab macaroni and cheese.

Bar Riva Disney's Riviera Resort

With just one outdoor table-service choice at Disney's Hollywood Studios a quick trip on the Disney Skyliner over to Disney's newest hotel Disney's Riviera Resort adds another fun option. Technically the resort's pool bar Bar Riva is a beautiful open-air space tiled in serene shades of blue with lots of nods to the Italian and French Riviera.

Bar Riva is walk-up only but offers a table-service service lounge menu of Mediterranean-inspired dishes such as tuna Niçoise and Greek salads baked brie in puff pastry and grilled vegetable skewers. If the tables are full and you don't want to wait quick-service Primo Piatto next door is a reliable backup. Mobile order it to go and find a spot outside.

Disney Springs

You'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to outdoor dining options at Disney Springs. With far too many strong contenders to list comprehensively the following are a few of our favorites (honorable mentions include Raglan Road and The Polite Pig) all of which offer outdoor seating — just note your preference at check-in.

Wine Bar George

George Miliotis' Disney Springs wine bar is known for its delicious small plates and expertly curated wine list. Make a meal of shareable like the saganaki on fire crispy mac and cheese bites and grilled romaine cheese and charcuterie boards. Or save room for the entrees and family-style plates of skirt steak or grilled whole Greek sea bass.

Take in the details before sitting at a table on the waterfront terrace and ordering from a heavily themed menu of shareables such as the loaded pretzel Fountain of Youth chicken wings and Doctor Astorga's queso fundido plus a selection of flatbreads and tacos. An equally creative cocktail menu keeps regulars coming back again and again.

The Boathouse

Waterfront outdoor dining plays right into the charming maritime theming at The Boathouse which does surf and turf better than any other spot at Walt Disney World. Start with oysters on the falf shell from the raw bar peel and eat shrimp or main lobster bisque followed by a Maine style lobster roll or award-winning burger. Or go all out with a Gibsons heritage steak and Maine lobster tail add-on.

Pictures HBO Max Buy Dakota Johnson Sundance Comedy ‘Am I OK?’ (EXCLUSIVE),"Warner Bros. Pictures and HBO Max have nabbed “Am I OK?” a romantic comedy starring Dakota Johnson as a woman grappling with her sexuality. The movie premiered this week to positive reviews at the virtual Sundance Film Festival.

Tig Notaro and Stephanie Allynne co-directed “Am I OK?” which was written by Lauren Pomerantz and produced by Picturestart Gloria Sanchez Productions and Johnson’s TeaTime Pictures.

The film will premiere on HBO Max at a yet-to-be-determined date.

“Am I OK?” follows 32-year-old Lucy (Johnson) who lives in Los Angeles and figures out later in life that the reason her dates with the opposite gender never end with anything more than a handshake is because well she’s not attracted to men. With the help of her life-long friend Jane (Sonoya Mizuno) Lucy attempts to navigate coming out in her 30s. The story is loosely based on Pomerantz’s own life.

The cast also includes Jermaine Fowler Kiersey Clemons Molly Gordon and Sean Hayes. Johnson Notaro Allyene and Pomerantz produced “Am I OK?” along with Jessica Elbaum Will Ferrell Erik Feig Lucy Kitada and Ro Donnelly. Executive producers were Alex Brown Royce Reeves Darby and Shayne Fiske.

Popular on Variety

In Variety’s review of the film critic Amy Nicholson praised the on-screen dynamic between the two female leads. “Johnson and Mizuno do have great repartee” Nicholson wrote. “They’re both quick with a prickly quip.”

The Atlantic’s Shirley Li described the film as “breezily charming” adding “It won me over for its layered study of a close female friendship and the power such relationships can hold even when they fracture.”

Johnson who also starred in the Sundance crowd pleaser “Cha Cha Real Smooth” said she found herself drawn to the raw emotion under the film’s comedic surface.

“It’s a story and subject matter that I thought was really cool in the shape of a female buddy comedy but there’s some very real and honest and difficult internal landscapes happening within these women” Johnson said at Variety’s Sundance Studio.

At this year’s Sundance Film Festival — which is running online through Jan. 30 — sales had been slow to heat up but they have been gaining traction as the 10-day gathering nears its end. Other buzzy titles that have been purchased include “Cha Cha Real Smooth” to Apple TV Plus “Living” to Sony Pictures Classics and “Good Luck to You Leo Grande” to Searchlight and Hulu.

UTA Independent Film Group brokered the deal for “Am I OK?.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAxLzI5L3doeS1tb3ZpZS10aGVhdGVycy1jb3VsZC1iZS10aGUtbmV4dC1iaWctYWNxdWlzaXRpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Movie Theaters Could Be the Next Big Acquisition Target,"Overturning a 74-year old court ruling may cause a boom for cinema stocks.

After a flurry of acquisitions in the gaming industry investors looking to get ahead of future deals may be wondering which industry faces consolidation next. The answer could lie in movie theaters.

Decree decreased

In 1948 the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Paramount Pictures Inc. that studios cannot own theaters due to antitrust laws. However a federal judge granted The Department of Justice's motion to lift the ""Paramount Decree"" on August 7 2020 starting a two-year sunset termination period.

After the decree ends in August 2022 movie studios like Disney (DIS 2.47%) may look to enter the theatrical distribution business the quickest way possible: acquiring movie theater operators.

But why would studios acquire cineplexes when streaming is on the rise and brick-and-mortar movie exhibitors are struggling? For starters blockbusters like Spider-Man: No Way Home are still making money at the box office -- raking in $1.69 billion worldwide to date. And instead of making 55% to 60% of the gross ticket sales a studio could take the full 100%. Just 1% extra on a billion-dollar blockbuster would earn a studio an extra $10 million.

Alternatively streaming services could get creative with their subscriptions by releasing blockbusters early or including tickets as part of its value proposition. Notably Amazon.com and Netflix (NFLX 3.04%) don't have to comply with the ""Paramount Decree"" because ""they didn't exist when the decrees were signed."" In fact Netflix already purchased Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in 2020. Disney purchased the El Capitan Theatre in the 1980s but that required court proceedings at the time of purchase -- which will no longer be the case come August.

Potential targets

AMC Entertainment (AMC -0.30%) is the world's largest cinema chain owning roughly 950 theatres and its enterprise value -- deserved or not -- reflects that at roughly $16.7 billion. AMC gains some competitive advantage from its broader reach in international markets compared to its competitors with approximately a third of its theatres in Europe and the Middle East. Since most blockbusters gross more money internationally -- Spider Man: No Way Home has made roughly 57% of its box office returns outside of the U.S. -- AMC may be a more attractive target than its domestically concentrated competitors.

Outside of AMC publicly traded movie theater companies like Cinemark (CNK -4.01%) and The Marcus Corporation (MCS -5.37%) have been struggling over the past couple of years -- largely because of the pandemic.

Cinemark at a $5.1 billion enterprise value is a pure movie theater play owning 524 theatres in the U.S. and Latin America. The Marcus Corporation at a $1 billion enterprise value owns or operates 85 theatres primarily in the Midwestern United States but also owns or manages 19 hotels. Unlike AMC's ""meme stock"" rise both Cinemark and The Marcus Corporation have seen their stocks cut in nearly half since the beginning of the pandemic making both attractive to potential acquirers.

Why it might not happen

The movie theater business is in decline and the top chains carry massive debt. Cinemark's total debt has ballooned from $2 billion to $3.9 billion over the past three years. And while AMC has been able to pay down some of its nearly $11 billion total debt by issuing more than 400 million new shares over the last two fiscal years it still might be a tough pill for an acquirer to swallow.

Even before the pandemic the theater industry sold 200 million fewer domestic tickets in 2019 compared to its highs in the early oughts. While movie theaters have been raising prices for years to compensate for the drop in ticket sales there are no guarantees that moviegoers will return especially as the pandemic seemingly continues into its third year. In fact when CivicScience recently polled 60000 Americans 71% responded that they preferred watching something at home over going out to a movie.

Still as streaming grows in popularity studios covet box office sales. This year HBO Max ended same-day releases for its Warner Bros. theatrical releases creating a 45-day window of theatrical exclusivity. No example may be more telling than Paramount delaying the release of Top Gun: Maverick five times -- while reportedly refusing to sell the film to AppleTV+ and Netflix -- to see that its tentpole franchise has the opportunity to have a proper box office run.

What's next

If movie theaters are able to replicate the success of Spider Man: No Way Home in the first half of 2022 with slated blockbuster releases like The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick don't be surprised if studios like Disney or the soon-to-be Warner Bros. Discovery can't resist a larger piece of their billion-dollar franchises' pie. Watch their actions closely after the ""Paramount Decree"" sunsets in August -- or even sooner if Amazon and Netflix want to take advantage of a loophole.

As far as the most likely target Cinemark appears to be the most attractive. While Cinemark doesn't offer the market penetration of AMC its presence in Latin America could be attractive as Latin influences on Hollywood grow. And each Cinemark theatre works out to $9.7 million of the company's enterprise value -- the best and lowest per-theater value among its competitors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL211bHRpdmVyc2UtbW92aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's 5 Great Movies About the Multiverse and the Many Worlds Hypothesis,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL211bHRpdmVyc2UtbW92aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

""The job is very important"" said a representative for Waste Management. ""First of all they have to be safe for the communities. They also need to take the materials they're picking up to the landfill. If we're late it's not a good day.""

There's a lot to learn about when behind the wheel of one of these 30000-pound vehicles. That's why drivers come to a closed course in Glendale where they learn the ins and outs of operating the truck and maneuvering it on small residential streets in any type of condition rain or shine.

The facility has a two-week training program. The first week is a virtual training where drivers learn the rules and the WM safety defensive driving system. The second week is where they go on the job and learn how to perform pre-trip inspections brake tests and how to perform hazardous energy control at the landfill.

The drivers are always on the go for 12 to 13 hours a day making sure waste is picked up in a timely manner.

TRI data are reported to EPA annually by facilities in certain industry sectors including federal facilities that manufacture process or otherwise use TRI-listed chemicals above certain quantities. The data include quantities of such chemicals that were released into the environment or otherwise managed as waste. Information collected through the TRI allows communities to learn how facilities in their area are managing listed chemicals. The data collected also help inform EPA’s efforts to better understand the listed substances.

“We will use every tool in our toolbox to protect our communities from PFAS pollution” said Assistant Administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention Michal Freedhoff. “Requiring companies to report on how these PFAS are being managed recycled or released is an important part of EPA’s comprehensive plan to fill critical data gaps for these chemicals and take meaningful action to safeguard communities from PFAS.”

The Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) provides the framework for adding additional PFAS to the TRI each year. For TRI Reporting Year 2022 (reporting forms due by July 1 2023) reporting is required for four additional PFAS.

Among other provisions section 7321(c) of the NDAA identifies certain regulatory activities that automatically add PFAS or classes of PFAS to the TRI beginning January 1 the following year and the agency’s finalization of a toxicity value is one of the triggering actions.

In April 2021 EPA finalized a toxicity value for perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) (Chemical Abstracts Service registry number (CASRN) 375-73-5) and potassium perfluorobutane sulfonate (CASRN 29420-49-3); therefore these substances have been added to TRI. PFBS-based compounds are replacement chemicals for PFOS a chemical that was voluntarily phased out by the primary U.S. manufacturer by 2002. PFBS has been identified in the environment and consumer products including surface water wastewater drinking water dust carpeting and carpet cleaners and floor wax.

EPA previously updated the Code of Federal Regulations with PFAS that were added to the TRI on January 1 2021 pursuant to section 7321(c) of the NDAA and their being regulated by an existing significant new use rule (SNUR) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (see 40 CFR 721.10536). EPA has since determined that one additional PFAS CASRN 65104-45-2 is designated as “active” on the TSCA Inventory and is covered by the SNUR. Therefore this substance has also been added to the TRI pursuant to the NDAA.

Additionally under NDAA section 7321(e) EPA must review CBI claims before adding any PFAS to the TRI list whose identity is subject to a claim of protection from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(a). EPA previously identified one PFAS CASRN 203743-03-7 for addition to the TRI list based on the NDAA’s provision to include certain PFAS upon the NDAA’s enactment (section 7321(b)(1)); however due to a confidential business information (CBI) claim related to its identity this PFAS was not included on the TRI list until EPA completed its review of the CBI claim. This PFAS was included in updates to the confidential status of chemicals on the TSCA Inventory published by EPA in October 2021 and thus was added to the TRI list due to the CBI declassification.

As of January 1 2022 facilities which are subject to reporting requirements for these chemicals should start tracking their activities involving these PFAS as required by Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. Reporting forms for these PFAS will be due to EPA by July 1 2023 for calendar year 2022 data.

EPA continues to act on Administrator Regan’s PFAS Strategic Roadmap announced in October 2021 a plan that delivers on the agency ’s mission to protect public health and the environment and answers the call for action on these persistent and dangerous chemicals. In addition to continuing to add PFAS to the TRI EPA also will soon announce a series of PFAS test orders that will require PFAS manufacturers to provide the agency with toxicity data and information on PFAS.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW1waW9ubmV3c3BhcGVycy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlX2M2ZjhiMTE2LTgwOGMtMTFlYy1hOGViLTA3Y2NkOTQ5ZjNjZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste Management wins Chino Hills trash contract | News | championnewspapers.com,"×

Since 2006 California has aggressively pursued establishment of economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction programs. One recent program is aimed at reducing the release of methane gas from landfills through mandated diversion of business-generated organic waste. The organic waste regulations currently in effect now impact commercial businesses and the jurisdictions in which they operate.

Senate Bill 1383

California Senate Bill 1383 requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) and the State Air Resources Board (ARB) to implement a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of powerful climate change forces that have relatively short atmospheric lifetimes the “Short-Lived Climate Pollutants” (SLCPs). It amends the Health and Safety Code (HSC) to require the reduction of statewide emissions of methane by 40% below 2013 levels by 2030 and the reduction of landfill organic waste disposal by 75% below 2014 levels by 2025.

Commercial Business Impacts

As of January 1 2022 all California commercial businesses absent an exception set out below must do the following: provide organic waste containers for their customers employees contractors and tenants; establish and provide organic waste management training; conduct organic waste monitoring to ensure that organic waste is being source separated; and subscribe to an approved organic waste hauling service or alternatively self-haul their organic waste in compliance with the regulations.

The regulations permit local government jurisdictions to adopt standards that are more stringent than the requirements of the state-wide regulations so businesses with locations in multiple California jurisdictions will need to closely monitor these requirements to ensure compliance with local rules.

Requirements Imposed on Local Government Jurisdictions

Jurisdictions are required to adopt enforceable mechanisms to implement the SLCP regulations by January 1 2022. Jurisdictions have the authority to grant waivers to organic waste generators under certain circumstances exempting those generators from some or all of the SLCP regulation requirements. Additionally local governments in certain areas may apply to CalRecycle for program waivers exempting some or all of the organic waste generators in their jurisdictions from SB 1383 requirements. Local program waivers can apply where the population subject to the jurisdiction of the local government is small or the geographic area served by the local jurisdiction is at or above a certain elevation.

Additionally local governments in certain areas may apply to CalRecycle for program waivers exempting some or all of the organic waste generators in their jurisdictions from SB 1383 requirements. Local program waivers can apply where the population subject to the jurisdiction of the local government is small or the geographic area served by the local jurisdiction is at or above a certain elevation.

Jurisdictions were required to have an inspection and compliance program in place by January 1 2022. Prior to February 1 2022 local jurisdictions must provide organic waste education and outreach information to most generators including edible food recovery information to “Tier One” and “Tier Two” commercial edible food generators like grocery stores restaurants and hotels.

As of April 1 2022 local jurisdictions may begin monitoring waste hauler routes to determine if commercial businesses are complying with organic waste generator requirements. Local jurisdictions and CalRecycle may begin issuing penalties for non-compliance in amounts ranging from $50 to $10000 per violation per day depending on the severity and type of violation.

Time To Act

The SLCP regulations are additive to existing solid waste recycling requirements established by earlier legislative bills such as AB 341 AB 1826 and AB 827 which already apply to California commercial businesses. Organic waste generators needed to take SB 1383 compliance actions prior to January 1 2022 and they will need to continue to monitor local requirements to ensure compliance with organic waste ordinances that may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

But if what's shown up to be buried in Brevard's two landfills over the past 24 months is any indication locals weren't just ordering takeout binging on Netflix and tossing used face masks after they ventured out.

It appears they like Americans nationwide were also working on home projects with renovations from roof to curb according to data from the Solid Waste Management Department.

From 2019 to 2021 Brevard County saw a 12% increase in solid waste being disposed of in local landfills said Tom Mulligan interim department director.

The biggest leap in what we pitched?

More like this:Sustainability and embracing the future of Florida

No not those non-recyclable food containers you tried to pretend weren't in your trash containers by covering them with cat litter.

It was stuff already in our homes — and stuff we used to repair renovate and refresh those refuges.

""From the data we have the three largest increases in waste over this period are from residential renovation roofing and vegetative waste the largest increase"" Mulligan said.

So how to ascertain what got used and dumped?

A good indicator would be ""the 47% increase in the number of vehicles crossing our scales between 2019 and 2020"" said Mulligan.

""This means that there was an increase in vehicles with smaller loads coming across the scales in 2020 indicating that these would be comprised of the shed/garage/attic cleanouts that occurred during the initial shutdowns for COVID"" he said.

The increase in waste disposed between 2019 and 2021 is a larger rate of increase than historical rates Mulligan said ""which can vary based on economic conditions or if hurricanes affected the county that year.""

Who's tossing what where?

In 2021 the University of Miami reported that the number of home improvement projects in the country ""has risen dramatically during the pandemic"" with the Home Improvement Research Institute predicting Americans spent $439.9 billion on home improvement products in 2020.

Eileen Brock of Palm Bay whose artistic skills and love of mosaic show up in projects across her property likes to ""recycle more than I toss.""

In March 2020 as word of the pandemic spread she started working on a fourth mosaic wall. More recently she demolished her upstairs bathroom.

Sometimes even with recycling and other options for donation of unwanted materials there's little choice but to ""trash it.""

When Brock redid that bathroom for example the tub became a worm farm. The sink she mosaiced into a bird bath.

But ""all the old grout went bye-bye"" Brock said.

""I saved the old tile for mosaic and I tried to save the old vanity to donate to Habitat but it had been bashed too many times"" she said. ""To the curb went the leftovers.""

Once at the curb where the material goes depends on where and what it is.

The Sarno Road Class III Landfill is in Melbourne and the Central Disposal Facility Class I landfill in Cocoa.

The distinction between the two Mulligan said: Class III waste is defined as yard trash construction and demolition debris processed tires asbestos carpet cardboard paper glass plastic furniture other than appliances or other approved materials not expected to produce leachate that poses a threat to public health or the environment. Leachates are liquids that have passed through or emerged from solid waste which must be captured for proper treatment and disposal.

Class I waste includes the organics and ""putrecibles"" — items liable to decay — that are generated in residential households or commercial eateries and generate leachate.

So that means Class III waste generated in the south portion of Brevard County would be disposed in the Sarno Road landfill. Class III waste generated in the central and north portions of the county would be disposed at the Central Disposal Facility.

Saving Planet Earth a bucket of litter at a time:This Brevard couple really cleans up

All Class I waste is disposed of at the Central Disposal Facility. If coming from the south or north portions of the county they go by way of the Sarno Road Transfer Station or Titusville Transfer Station respectively.

""The purpose of these transfer stations is to shorten the distance to the disposal point and keep the smaller garbage collection trucks on their routes while consolidating the waste into lager trucks for transfer to the Central Disposal Facility"" Mulligan said.

Staff shortages here too

That brings up another topic: those trucks.

Like seemingly every other operation of any kind Solid Waste is experiencing staffing shortages.

There's a nationwide dearth of drivers with Class A commercial driver licenses necessary for those who operate the county's transfer trucks.

""We also have similar shortage issues with other Solid Waste Operations staff"" said Mulligan. ""Many positions have become harder to fill given the competition from private enterprises who often are able to make offers that appear more tempting to candidates.""

Also contributing to the challenge: equipment. Due to COVID causing disruptions in the supply chain Mulligan said ""build and delivery times on new equipment have increased dramatically.""

'This causes the county to continue to rely on the equipment that was to be replaced which leads to additional equipment down time and out-of-warranty repair costs"" he said. ""Down time of equipment has also increased due to shortages in the availability of parts.""

All this has led to the solid waste team ""making do with fewer staff and fewer pieces of reliable equipment"" said Mulligan.

""I’m proud of all of the staff and how they have all pulled together to help keep this county running in these unprecedented circumstances.""

And as for those masks while they're not monitored it's a good bet they're not in short supply in the landfill.

""We prefer more masks in the trash than in the parks parking lots waterways and beaches"" Mulligan said. ""We hope there are more masks in the trash.""

Sunday PM

(SitNews) Seattle Washington - U.S.-based conservation groups welcome the Jan. 20 news of a great win resolving the threat of B.C. mining in the so-called ""Donut Hole"" of the Upper Skagit River that flows from British Columbia (B.C.) into Washington state. Due to sustained pressure for three years from a robust international coalition of more than 300 organizations the prospect of mining by Imperial Metals Corp. in the Skagit headwaters is no longer a threat to the river and communities downstream. Map courtesy Imperial Metals Corp. The decision to now surrender all remaining claims recognizes the challenges of obtaining mineral exploration and development permits in this area. Said Brian Kynoch President of Imperial ”Our objective as a mining company would have been to proceed with exploration of our claims. But as a company that is responsive to the aspirations of Indigenous communities government and neighbours we support this agreement.“ Imperial has held Giant Copper since April 1988. The claim area hosts two mineral deposits containing copper silver and gold and a recently discovered gold showing. The claim area predates the creation of Manning Park and the Skagit Valley Provincial Park which now surround the claim area. This announcement that Imperial Metals Corp. has relinquished its Skagit mineral claims signals the B.C. government can do the right thing with enough international pressure and financial support. However our fight against multiple B.C. mining operations in the headwaters of shared U.S.-B.C. transboundary rivers is far from over. Binding watershed protections are needed to protect many rivers shared by B.C. and Washington Alaska Idaho and Montana from polluting under-regulated B.C. mines. ""We in Washington regard British Columbia as a great neighbor with which we share a love of nature and prosperous commerce"" said Mitch Friedman executive director of Seattle-based Conservation Northwest. ""But B.C. is anything but neighborly in the way they jeopardize our rivers communities and fish and wildlife."" Quoting a news release from Salmon Beyond Borders B.C. has weak dangerous mining regulations and lacks a process through which downstream jurisdictions can give meaningful input. As a result communities in Washington Alaska Idaho and Montana have long been impacted by active and potential B.C. mine pollution flowing downstream across the international border. Many of these U.S. communities are at continued risk of future catastrophic pollution from B.C. mine tailings dams waste which B.C.'s own experts have predicted to fail at the rate of two every ten years. For example the Copper Mountain Mine is only 50 miles north of the Washington border in the headwaters of the Similkameen River the next large transboundary watershed to the east of the Skagit. It is the third-largest copper mine in Canada. It features two leaky tailings dams that are already four times the height of Imperial Metals' Mount Polley mine waste dam that collapsed in 2014 and sent 6.6 billion gallons of contaminated mine waste into the Fraser River watershed. According to Salmon Beyond Borders despite its size and protest from those downstream Copper Mountain Mine plans to expand operations significantly. Communities and salmon fisheries in southeast Alaska northern Idaho and northwest Montana are similarly impacted and threatened by massive poorly regulated mines in B.C. and the lack of binding watershed protections developed by all entities who share and depend on these iconic transboundary rivers. “This underscores the power of indigenous-led conservation and management. Hopefully the entire region will revert back to the peoples that have the knowledge and wisdom to pass this on to all future generations"" said Rob Sanderson Jr. Chair of the Southeast Alaska Indigenous Transboundary Commission. ""This is a milestone for the Skagit and our friends in B.C. and Washington but Alaska has been asking for the cleanup of B.C.'s abandoned and polluting Tulsequah Chief mine in southeast Alaska's largest wild salmon-producing river for decades Imperial Metals Corp. is already operating in the transboundary Stikine River watershed and the largest open-pit mine in North America is proposed just miles upstream from a U.S. national monument in the Unuk River watershed. Just like in the Skagit taxpayers are on the hook for government pay-outs to the mining companies i.e. cleanup at Mt. Polley and Tulsequah Chief. The B.C. system is broken and that is why multiple tribes and nearly every municipality in southeast Alaska have recently passed resolutions calling for a ban on B.C. tailings dams upriver and a temporary pause on B.C. mine permitting along shared rivers until an international agreement is implemented"" said Jill Weitz director of Juneau-based Salmon Beyond Borders. “In Alaska while we are thankful for success in protecting the shared waters of the Skagit we look upstream with dismay at the runaway B.C. mine leasing and permitting system that has put downstream Alaska communities and Tribes at risk from a rapidly evolving mining pollution threat. An impending future of B.C. mega mines and risky tailings dams overhanging our shared waters demands urgent bilateral attention” said Aaron Brakel Inside Passage Waters Program Manager for the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. ""We currently talk about transboundary watersheds as individual puzzle pieces each with their own unique water quality and pollution issues. But if we take a step back and look at the complete puzzle all of the pollution issues in these individual transboundary systems stem from only one source: B.C. Montana Idaho Washington and Alaska are all threatened by B.C. mining practices and their pollution. We need policy changes that will work to address the pollution issues in all U.S./B.C. transboundary systems. The success in the Skagit watershed provides an important stepping stone to achieve bilateral transboundary watershed protections but we need to start thinking about these issues on a much wider scale not individual puzzle pieces"" said Ellie Hudson-Heck Conservation Assistant with the Idaho Conservation League. ""A diverse coalition of anglers Tribes state and federal governments businesses and concerned downstream residents have come together to hold British Columbia's mining industry accountable for selenium pollution entering Montana and Idaho from large coal mining operations on the Elk River in B.C."" said Clayton Elliott conservation director of Montana Trout Unlimited. ""We have done so because B.C. has demonstrated time and again that they will not hold big polluters accountable for their impacts at home and downstream which makes the news from the Skagit watershed a success for water quality for our fisheries and communities."" “The news that an international coalition was able to effect a change in mining plans in the Skagit drainage is great news” says Frank Szollosi executive director of the Montana Wildlife Federation. “Montanans have an affinity for our British Columbia neighbors and we share many natural resources such as water fish wildlife and the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. Current and historic coal mining is contributing 95 percent of the selenium to Lake Koocanusa at rates up to 30 times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency approved standard for water quality and fish life. Westslope cutthroat populations in the Elk River have declined more than 90 percent in recent years and other native species have been negatively impacted as well. We hope the Skagit agreement signals a new willingness to work to resolve these transboundary issues.” Imperial is a Vancouver based exploration mine development and operating company with holdings that include the Mount Polley mine (100%) the Huckleberry mine (100%) the Red Chris mine (30%). Imperial also holds a portfolio of 23 greenfield exploration properties in British Columbia.

Yet once again it is hoping for a clean start.

In total water companies spilled raw sewage into coastal bathing waters more than 5500 times last year prompting a another investigation by the Environment Agency and the industry regulator Ofwat in November.

Weeks later Ofwat raised a red flag over the financial health of three of Britain’s biggest water companies – Southern Yorkshire and SES. The regulator expressed concern about “weak levels of financial resilience” and levels of customer service that lagged behind the rest of the industry.

For Southern the resilience report gave a snapshot of the company’s financial health before an equity injection from a familiar character in the water sector’s chequered history the Australian investment bank Macquarie.

Macquarie gained notoriety for its role as the owner of Thames Water between 2006 and 2016 when it attracted fierce political scrutiny for extracting billions in shareholder dividends while Thames’s debt soared. By 2018 the Labour party had called for the sector to be returned to public ownership.

But five years after selling out of Thames the Australian infrastructure investor was given the regulator’s blessing to return to run one of the most troubled water companies in the industry – a move that raised eyebrows in the industry.

The £1bn in fresh equity for Southern over the summer followed Ofwat’s decision to enforce a record £90m fine against Southern for deliberately pouring sewage into the sea and came with a promise to invest a further £2bn over the next four years.

Macquarie has not stopped there. Within months of its return to the UK’s water sector it agreed to invest £130m in green bonds issued by a subsidiary of Affinity Water and £120m in Anglian Water’s debt. The passive investments are part of the bank’s sprawling set of investments in UK infrastructure.

Macquarie owns the Green Investment Bank which was set up with UK taxpayer funds and controversially privatised four years ago. Under its ownership GIB’s profits more than quadrupled to £144m for the year ending March 2021 compared with the year before. It has paid a total of £174m in dividends to Macquarie which also owns gas networks airports and telecoms service companies across the UK.

Aileen Armstrong a senior director at Ofwat said the regulator had “really welcomed the money coming into the regulated business” while being “clear about the expectations on what the company needed to do for customers.

“We have wanted to see a turnaround and a component of that is an equity injection into the company which is what this transaction did. We have been very clear – and would be with any prospective new owner – about what we expected of the regulated company and the need for a turnaround in the operations there” she said.

One senior industry source said Ofwat’s decision to give Macquarie its blessing to return to the water industry showed “just how desperate they were” after Southern’s record pollution fine and its troubling financial position.

“Southern was not an attractive prospect for investors and the company’s management was perhaps unsurprisingly on its knees. Investors would not have been falling over themselves to take a share of Southern” the source said.

However Martin Bradley the head of Macquarie’s “real assets” team in Europe the Middle East and Africa said his bank was happy to return to the UK’s water industry despite “misunderstandings” over its ownership of Thames and the concerns over Southern’s financial health.

“We didn’t pay a premium for Southern Water” he said. “We invest in long-term infrastructure and there’s nothing more long-term than the provision of utilities like water. This is what we do and we think we’re quite good operators.”

Macquarie’s spell at Thames was far from blemish-free. In 2017 the water company was fined £20m after admitting it dumped 1.4bn litres of raw sewage into the River Thames at six sites in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire between 2013 and 2014. The water company’s finances were also a cause for alarm with Macquarie criticised for selling Thames with almost £11bn of debt after a decade in which the bank paid itself £1.6bn in dividends ran up a £260m pension deficit and paid next to no UK corporation tax.

A former senior Thames employee said of Macquarie: “Were they an effective focused investor? Absolutely. But can you expect them to operate a utility in the public interest? Well only if you are certain that the regulatory framework rewards the good behaviours and penalises the bad. Ofwat hasn’t always done that.”

The characterisation of the Australian bank as a “vampire kangaroo” or an aggressive asset stripper has sometimes been unfair he added.

“They did extract more out of the company than would be ideal but it was in full sight of the regulator. And where it made sense under the regulatory framework for Macquarie to invest in Thames they were happy to invest too” he said.

Macquarie’s interests in the water sector are part of a more than £50bn of investment in UK infrastructure that it has either arranged or invested directly since 2005. These include Cadent which is the UK’s largest gas distribution network operator as well as the operator of Aberdeen Glasgow and Southampton airports and the broadcast service provider Arqiva.

“We didn’t need to convince the regulator” Bradley said of Macquarie’s return to the UK water industry. “Ofwat has said they’d be keeping a close eye on the situation at Southern Water. They expect us to deliver and we expect to deliver.”

The former Thames employee said that at the end of the day Macquarie was driven entirely by the bottom line and the letter of Ofwat’s regulation.

“They were always in it for the money and they were able to use the regulatory regime to take an aggressive approach at times” he said. However there have been concerns for some time that there has been “underspending in areas that Ofwat didn’t measure” that has led to “an accumulation of problems over decades”.

Armstrong said there had already been “quite a lot of change in the regulatory regime since Macquarie was last in the sector”.

“Over the last few years we’ve been very clear about making sure there is financial resilience in the sector and that the companies are focused on delivering good operation performance” she said. Hopefully this time Ofwat has been clear enough. The regulator can wash its hands of the past only so many times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDQ1NDg5OS9XYXRlci1maXJtcy1UaGFtZXMtWW9ya3NoaXJlLVNvdXRoZXJuLXBheS1OTy10YXguaHRtbNIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDQ1NDg5OS9hbXAvV2F0ZXItZmlybXMtVGhhbWVzLVlvcmtzaGlyZS1Tb3V0aGVybi1wYXktTk8tdGF4Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Water firms Thames Yorkshire and Southern pay NO tax,"Three of Britain's biggest water companies paid no corporation tax last year an investigation by The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Our findings that they failed to contribute a penny of the business tax to the Treasury's coffers will infuriate critics at a time when water firms are under fire for pumping raw sewage into rivers and coastal waters.

Thames Water Yorkshire Water and Southern Water – controlled by wealthy overseas investors and foreign Governments – have been repeatedly accused of polluting bathing water and causing catastrophic damage to wildlife. Critics have demanded the overhaul of a 'broken' system that allows water giants to build up vast debts and siphon billions of pounds out of the country.

Leaking money: Thames Yorkshire and Southern forked out a total of £1.4billion to service massive debts and satisfy other charges linked to their complex financial structures

Our probe discovered that the three companies forked out a total of £1.4billion to service massive debts and satisfy other charges linked to their complex financial structures.

This resulted in the wiping out of their profits and therefore of their corporation tax liabilities. The tax is only charged on companies that are in the black.

The three firms were singled out for criticism four years ago when Michael Gove then Environment Secretary complained that they made 'particularly keen use of sophisticated financial engineering' to reduce their tax burden while enriching their shareholders.

The Mail on Sunday revealed in November that nine water companies had amassed debts of more than £50billion despite being privatised in the 1990s free of borrowings. Thames Yorkshire and Southern are responsible for half of that figure. A separate report earlier last month said a total of £72billion had been extracted by the owners of the companies in dividends and other payments.

The Public Accounts Committee has said there is a 'serious risk' that parts of England – particularly London and the South East – will run out of water in 20 years. Major investment will be required to repair leaking supply networks as well as importing water into the worst hit regions and building reservoirs.

Feargal Sharkey the pop star turned campaigner for clean rivers said: 'What we have with these companies is smoke and mirrors. They have made off with £72billion and we've ended up with rivers full of sewage. They are out of control.

'A lack of investment means parts of the South East are running out of water. Someone is going to have to start spending huge amounts of money.

But with £50billion of debt sitting on the balance sheet they can't afford to finance that. So the taxpayer gets screwed and our environment has been devastated. Who is picking up the bill for that?'

Sharkey who is chairman of Hertfordshire's Amwell Magna Fishery the oldest fly-fishing club in England called for urgent action from the Government and regulator Ofwat to bring the companies into line. He also demanded that 30 per cent of each privately owned water company is returned to the stock market to improve transparency over their financial affairs.

Southern's biggest shareholders include Australian fund Macquarie which is known as the 'vampire kangaroo' for squeezing billions of pounds in dividends from Thames Water which it owned between 2006 and 2017. The company made a loss of £350million on revenues of almost £785million last year.

The owners of Thames now include funds controlled by the Abu Dhabi and Kuwaiti governments. Its parent company Kemble Water Holdings reported revenue of £2billion and a loss of £370million.

Yorkshire Water is owned by foreign sovereign wealth funds including GIC Special Investments controlled by the Singapore government. Kelda Holdings its parent company reported revenue of £1.1billion and a loss of £152million.

Each of the water firms paid tax through National Insurance contributions VAT and other taxes and is investing heavily in infrastructure. They argue the low-tax structure helps keep bills low.

Thames said: 'We have an unprecedented amount of investment directed towards safeguarding our rivers and streams. Between 2020 and 2025 we are spending £1.25billion on maintaining and improving our operational sites.'

A statement on Yorkshire Water's website said it has 'not been required to pay any corporation tax in recent years'. The company said it paid £148million in other taxes last year.",,,,,,

On Sunday Jan. 16 hundreds of loyal Villanova Basketball fans gathered outside Philadelphia’s Wells Fargo Center for the first time since 2020 to support their beloved Wildcats.

But with a goal of viewing college basketball why do people feel the need to stand out in the cold for hours before the game? The answer is Tailgate Culture known in the United States as gatherings of people in parking lots of stadiums and arenas consuming alcoholic beverages. So is tailgating really just an excuse to get belligerent with friends?

To concisely answer that question no. Tailgating is an American tradition. It is a time meant to gather fans together to support their favorite sports teams. Unlike many other aspects of our lives these days tailgating is one thing where people of differing beliefs and backgrounds can find common ground. It brings people together creating a community of people instilled with hope tradition and camaraderie. Tailgating allows people to gather and grow in excitement together before a game without it the enthusiasm and intensity that fans bring to a stadium would simply not be the same.

But is tailgating an exclusively American phenomenon? Historically speaking a study performed by anthropologist John Sherry at the University of Notre Dame found that tailgating and parking lot parties date back to ancient Rome and Greece to picnics taking place on the battlefields during the Civil War and to campouts during the Occupy Wall Street movement. Thus tailgating has long been used as a way to create a sense of community.

But should colleges and universities allow underage students to gather in large groups where inevitably drinking will be involved? Well Villanova University actually updated its tailgating policy allowing festivities to begin three hours prior to tip off rather than the standard two. Perhaps this change denotes a shift in the unrealistic and outdated policies regarding underage drinking. Maybe tailgating is the gateway to resolving a deeper nationwide issue: the legal drinking age.

With so many privileges granted at the age of 18 why shouldn’t drinking be included alongside the ability to vote enlist in the military serve on a jury the list goes on. Realistically speaking drinking is a part of all tailgate events at colleges and otherwise and Villanova’s policy allows students to do it responsibly. With transportation provided to and from the stadium and plenty of time allowed for proper consumption of any alcohol one chooses to drink the University seems to be doing its part to allow its students to enjoy their experience at the game while also being safe.

Villanova’s fans are like no other: supporting their team in below freezing temperatures. With extended time for tailgates and proper transportation fans can now maximize their tailgating experience. Villanova’s approach to tailgating though should not be taken advantage of but something to appreciate and utilize correctly.

Those fans were quickly ejected from the arena before the game resumed ending in a victory for the 76ers. One of those fans has subsequently been banned from Wells Fargo Center for life according to Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Yahoo's Chris Haynes reported after the game that one of the fans that was ejected kept calling Anthony ""boy"" and yelled at him to ""get in the corner boy"" and ""keep shooting boy."" Anthony confirmed after the game that there were two groups of fans calling him ""boy"" and he felt that those fans crossed a line.

""It is what it is"" Anthony said. ""Some things was said unacceptable. I'm cool with fans heckling fans talking trash cheering for their team or the other team. I'm all for that but when you cross certain lines as a man that's what you're gonna see that's what you gonna get. I'm sure the people that's in charge will take care of it…My job is done when it comes to this.""

When asked about potential discipline Anthony deferred.

""That's not up to me. I'm not in control of that. Only thing I that I can do is — sometimes you play through it you try to play through certain things you play through the heckle but that's all fun and games. I've been doing that for 19-20 years. Especially coming here it's been a great place to come and play and I know how the fans are here. But there's just certain things you don't bring to any type of sporting event just certain things you don't say to anybody.

The NBA has sadly dealt with a number of high-profile fan incidents in recent years. Anthony's teammate Russell Westbrook was the subject of racist taunts from a fan in Utah in 2019 and LeBron James similarly dealt with such an incident in Atlanta last season. Another fan threw a water bottle at Kyrie Irving in Boston during last spring's playoffs. Teams typically respond swiftly by banning fans that engage in such behavior from arenas but sadly the league has struggled to prevent these incidents.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYXR0cmFjdGlvbnNtYWdhemluZS5jb20vdG9vdGhzb21lLW1pbGtzaGFrZS1mb3VuZHJ5LWRlYnV0cy1hdC1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWFzLXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWNlbnRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toothsome Milkshake Foundry debuts at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center,"The new Toothsome Milkshake Foundry at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia Penn. – home of the Philadelphia Flyers Philadelphia 76ers and Philadelphia Wings – offers the same artisanal shakes with decadent toppings that have made Toothsome Chocolate Emporium & Savory Feast Kitchen a favorite spot at Universal Orlando Resort (coming soon to Universal Studios Hollywood).

This editorial is based on “Budgetary Support Could Propel Our Quest For Pharma Innovation” which was published in Livemint on 28/01/2022. It talks about the steps that can be taken to boost the pharmaceutical industry of India.

For Prelims: Indian pharmaceutical industry Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. For Mains: India’s Pharma Sector - associated challenges and steps that can be taken to boost the sector Making India the world’s pharmacy in terms of value.

The Indian pharmaceutical industry has been playing a key role in improving global health through its affordable and high-quality generic medicines.

However the Indian pharma industry still faces numerous challenges in terms of R&D adequate funding domestic manufacturing of raw materials for drugs etc. in becoming one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical producers in terms of value.

For India to move into advanced therapies and biopharma products the government needs to incentivize the shift to a discovery-oriented and science-driven approach by providing fiscal incentives and enabling policies.

It also needs to build the necessary infrastructure that supports breakthrough advances in science and technology to drive innovation and give the India pharma and biopharma industry its rightful place under the sun.

India’s Pharma Sector

The World’s Pharmacy: India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer and is considered 'pharmacy to the world’ . It is the largest provider of generic drugs globally. The Indian pharmaceutical industry meets over 50% of global demand for various vaccines 40% of generic demand in the U.S. and 25% of all medicine in the U.K. Presently over 80% of the antiretroviral drugs used globally to combat AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) are supplied by Indian pharmaceutical firms.

India is the and is considered . It is the largest provider of generic drugs globally. Share in the Economy: The Indian pharmaceutical industry is a strategic industry for the nation with the advantage of scale (at $37 billion in 2019-20 it contributed 1.5% to the GDP directly with another 3% coming indirectly ). The industry also has global reach and is a net foreign exchange earner of more than $10 billion annually.

The Indian pharmaceutical industry is a strategic industry for the nation with the advantage of scale (at $37 billion in 2019-20 it contributed with another ). Progress in Global Share: In 1969 Indian pharmaceuticals had a 5% share of the market in India and global pharma had a 95% share. By 2020 it was the reverse with Indian pharma having an almost 85% share and global 15%. India already contributes over 20% by value to the global generics market with Indian products contributing over 40% (by volume) of US drugs.

Challenges

Complex Drug Development Process: Developing the new cutting-edge therapies is a complex and lengthy process. The scientific technical and regulatory bars are considerably higher making drug development difficult more time-consuming and very expensive.

Developing the new cutting-edge therapies is a complex and lengthy process. Low R&D Expenditure: India’s current public expenditure on Research & Development (R&D) remains low at less than 1% of gross domestic product (GDP). Whereas among the BRICS countries - China spends 2.1% of its GDP on R&D Brazil 1.3% and Russia a little over 1%. Moreover R&D incentives only accounted for 7.5% of total tax incentives and those for pharma were just 2.3% of this in 2018-19.

Whereas among the BRICS countries - China spends 2.1% of its GDP on R&D Brazil 1.3% and Russia a little over 1%. Lack of Funding : Despite the availability of several government instruments many brilliant ideas from entrepreneurs often do not come to fruition because of their inability to access adequate funding.

: Despite the availability of several government instruments many because of their inability to access adequate funding. Heavy Dependence on China: Despite being a leading supplier of high-quality medicines to several countries the Indian pharmaceutical industry is highly dependent on China for pharmaceutical raw materials i.e Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. Indian drug-makers import around 70% of their total bulk drug requirements from China.

Despite being a leading supplier of high-quality medicines to several countries the Indian pharmaceutical industry is highly i.e Price Capping: The Indian pharmaceutical Industry is facing pressure from both the government and the civil society to make generic medicines more affordable for a large section of the population of the country. However it is important to note that the medicine prices of India are already among the lowest in the world. The emphasis on low price of generic medicine impacts the net profits of pharma companies.

Way Forward

Increasing Value Share in Global Basket: Besides the volume share India now needs to capture value share as well. To move up the pharma value chain it needs to focus on emerging opportunities across novel biologics biosimilars mRNA and other new-generation vaccines orphan drugs antimicrobials precision medicines cell and gene therapies among others. To rank among the top five countries in value terms and No. 1 in volume terms the Indian pharma industry will need to grow from $44 billion currently to $120-130 billion by 2030 and $500 billion by 2047.

Besides the volume share India now needs to capture value share as well. To move up the pharma value chain it needs to focus on orphan drugs antimicrobials precision medicines cell and gene therapies among others. Boosting R&D Investments : Studies suggest that a 1% increase in R&D investment on average leads to a rise in output of between 0.05-0.15%. India will need to make exponential investments in R&D  manufacturing and digital transformations to become a global pharmaceutical innovation hub. The government needs to urgently explore mechanisms to incentivize investment in R&D and evaluate various funding mechanisms that can help the industry. The Budget for FY 2022-23 offers a great opportunity to give the pharma industry a shot in the arm. Research-linked incentives (RLIs) can provide an impetus for the industry to increase R&D investments as well as encourage it to forge much-needed linkages with academia to co- innovation.

: Studies suggest that a 1% increase in R&D investment on average leads to a rise in output of between 0.05-0.15%. Targeted Financial Incentives: In order to increase production the government needs to launch targeted financial incentives to promote the manufacturing of diagnostic kits and other medical devices — especially given that the raw material for manufacturing of these devices is heavily dependent on imports. This is also an opportunity to bring a much larger proportion of manufacturing of APIs back into India so that the country is not dependent on imports of critical inputs.

In order to increase production the government needs to launch targeted financial incentives — especially given that the raw material for manufacturing of these devices is heavily dependent on imports. Better Drug Pricing Policy: The Indian pharma industry is now at the cusp of developing new molecules for treatment of various medical conditions at scale. Developing new drugs costs money and the government needs to provide the conditions for sufficient profits for investment in new molecules while holding the firms accountable for producing new drugs for India and the world. At this time when Indian medicine prices are already amongst the lowest in the world there is a need to fine-tune the drug pricing policy to generate enough surpluses to invent new molecules while keeping the price levels reasonable with the objective of providing affordable healthcare.

While it doesn’t deliver the best PCIe 4.0 performance it competes well against many of the best PCIe 3.0 SSDs on the market and is listed at competitive prices.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

WD's Black SN750 SE' Special Edition' delivers sequential speeds of up to 3600/2830 MBps read/write but it is hardly faster than the best PCIe 3.0 SSDs which is curious given its PCIe 4.0 connection. However the SSD is priced to sell making it a great option for value seekers on the hunt for one of the best SSDs for a gaming rig.

Equipped with a Phison DRAM-less SSD controller and BiCS4 96-Layer TLC flash the SN750 SE's secret sauce is a mix of cost-efficient components clever marketing and low prices. While the DRAM-equipped SN750 excels in heavy workloads with its somewhat power-hungry eight-channel PCIe 3.0 controller the DRAM-less SN750 SE is better optimized for low-budget gaming builds with its four-channel PCIe 4.0 controller and newer flash although it still holds its own quite well when pressured with requests.

The special edition naming might indicate that this drive is an impromptu stopgap solution between the older SN750 and not a true replacement. Either that or it could be part of the company's attempt to optimally use up their last batches of BiCS4 TLC flash as it introduces newer BiCS5-equipped SSDs like the Blue SN570 we recently reviewed.

The WD Black SN750 SE is available in 250GB 500GB and 1TB capacities and is listed at very competitive prices ranging from $0.11 to $0.20 per gigabyte. Although it communicates over a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface the SN750 SE is only rated to deliver sequential speeds of up to 3600/2830 MBps read/write and sustain upwards of 525000/640000 random read/write IOPS at its highest capacity. The smaller capacities aren't quite as performant.

WD backs the SN750 SE with a five-year warranty and endurance ratings similar to the standard WD Black SN750 equating to 600TB of write data for our 1 TB sample. Leveraging the Phison SSD controller the SN750 SE features a fourth-gen LDPC engine SmartECC and end-to-end data path protection to ensure your data's integrity from when it's written until you retire the device. Similar to the SN750 it also lacks SED capability but fortunately that's not a big deal for most gamers. Trim secure erase support via the Format NVM command and SMART data reporting also come standard.

Software and Accessories

Like Samsung Magician WD’s SSD Dashboard is one of the best SSD toolbox softwares available. With it you can monitor your SSD's health and performance in real time upgrade the firmware if applicable and even enable gaming mode which disables all lower power states so that the SSD is always ready to perform optimally. WD also provides Acronis True Image for Western Digital so you can clone over your existing data to your new SSD.

A Closer Look

The Black SN750 SE comes in a single-sided M.2 2280 form factor so not only is it compatible with all desktop gaming systems it's also compatible with many of the best Ultrabooks too.

The Phison PS5019-E19T that powers the SN750 SE may lack DRAM but it isn't without some tricks to mitigate that. Instead of reading and updating directly on the flash itself it utilizes Host Memory Buffer (HMB) tech that grants the SSD's controller some of the host system's DRAM for the task. This feature offers improved performance with accelerated access to the metadata while only taking 64MB away from the host.

The controller features an ARM Cortex-R5 primary processor and leverages Phison's CoXProcessor Technology which means it has an additional dual-core co-processor to handle some of the firmware workloads. The controller is produced on TSMC's 28nm technology node. This isn't the newer 12nm node that Phison uses in some of its products but it still keeps fairly cool under load with features like power state management. Just in case it's needed thermal throttling will kick in if the SSD exceeds 84 degrees Celsius.

A single NAND package on our 1TB sample is filled to the brim with older generation BiCS4 96-Layer TLC flash. While this dual-plane flash is responsive it isn’t quite as fast as the quad-plane BiCS5 in newer drives. The controller supports transfer rates of up to 1200 MTps per channel but likely runs at Toggle 3.0 speeds of up to 800 MTps a limitation of the flash.

In an interview with Rolling Stone on Friday (January 28) Digital Nas who produced “Junya” and “Remote Control” for DONDA last year explained how Ye has set forth a standard for the project which specifically requires the music to be appropriate to play during four major moments in the span of any given person’s lifetime.

“These are the directives for the album” Digital Nas began. “If it cannot be played at a funeral childbirth graduation a wedding it will not be on our record. We learned a lot from DONDA 1. We learned what hit. We learned what was sticking. So we took from there. It has to be able to be played at four major moments in people’s lives. That’s crazy right?”

The 23-year-old also went on to discuss DONDA 2 studio sessions with artists such as Travis Scott along with the album’s executive producer Future who Digital Nas said he recorded a “Phenomenal” song with.

The 541 space’s relative obscurity belies its roster of heavy-hitting shows which has included Ed Ruscha Gerhard Richter John Currin Brice Marden and as of this month Damien Hirst with a body of work entitled ‘Forgiving and Forgetting’ which debuted in Rome in 2021.

Gagosian has ample square footage in the neighbourhood including a commanding foothold at 555 West 24th Street (home to its most ambitious programming such as last year’s ‘Social Works’ curated by Antwaun Sargent) and another space on West 21st Street. But the space at 541 West 24th Street possesses a refined and mercurial quality that seems to have resonated with art’s aforementioned big names.

There is an element of provenance – the space used to accommodate two galleries the once legendary Mary Boone Gallery and the still illustrious Pace Gallery (the latter has moved into larger premises one block north). But the new inhabitant’s appeal is more likely down to its sophisticated renovation by Caplan Colaku Architecture the New York firm that has collaborated with Gagosian recurrently over the years. Caplan Colaku also oversaw the overhaul of Gagosian’s uptown space at 980 Madison Avenue and is currently finishing the gallery’s offices right above.

‘What is unique about gallery design is that it is an entirely empty space that is effectively invisible’ says Jonathan Caplan a veritable gallery specialist given his past work with The Bass museum in Miami Gladstone Gallery and Petzel Gallery in New York as well as numerous exhibition designs. ‘Invisibility is an interesting challenge in itself especially when the space also needs to be capable of showing from one month to another vastly different kinds of exhibitions: huge abstract paintings miniature portraits monumental sculptures ephemeral installations film performance light works group shows.

‘Designing a gallery is in certain respects like [designing] a church hall or school gym which has the potential to be a badminton court a basketball court a running track a dance floor an assembly hall a vaccination centre a theatre a place of worship a polling station an examination room a storage space. But the similarity ends with the diversity because other multi-programmatic spaces do not need to be simultaneously neutral and undistracting and at the same time characterful and sympathetic.’

At 541 West 24th Street the firm refreshed the street-level space by combining two separate areas and concealing some of the distinctive features that had remained including historic wood trusses and an exposed decked ceiling. In its place a clean horizontal plane extends towards the space’s luminous skylight which in turn hovers above the length of the gallery at double-height.

The mix of volumes elegantly contracts and expands at different points throughout the space often opening up towards sources of natural light be it in the main gallery space or in the more introspective auxiliary space where the skylight has been manipulated and reconfigured to ensure an even distribution of natural light below.

In such a setting Hirst’s mash-up of cartoon character sculptures made from white Carrara and pink Portuguese marble and new Reverence Paintings take on an otherworldly aura. Caplan says that it was important to ‘[anticipate] how all sorts of artworks sometimes from very different eras and many that haven't been imagined yet [could] each be shown to their own best effect. The space itself [needs] to provide a feeling of continuity and permanence through time with its own particular character and atmosphere maintaining an unassuming demeanour while embodying and expressing the mission and identity of the gallery as an organisation.’

He adds ‘Points of differentiation in part evolve from the givens of the site itself and existing conditions of the property not least the proportions of the space. In the case of 541 you could say that the special feature that we were striving for was simplicity and spareness. We wanted to [give] flourish [to] the space and make it feel emotionally lighter by paring it down to a feeling of just space and light.’

He'll be directing and starring in a period Western movie called Horizon (yes terrible joke) and it will be his first time back in the director's chair since 2003's Open Range.

His first-ever shot at directing gave him a Best Picture and Best Director Academy Award for Dances With Wolves in 1990 so he'll be hoping this upcoming passion project will be just as successful.

The new movie is set as a saga spanning 15 years both before and after the Civil War expansion and settlement of the American West Deadline reports.

""America's expansion into the west was one that was fraught with peril and intrigue from the natural elements to the interactions with the indigenous peoples who lived on the land and the determination and at many times ruthlessness of those who sought to settle it"" Costner recently said in a statement.

""Horizon tells the story of that journey in an honest and forthcoming way highlighting the points of view and consequences of the characters' life and death decisions.""

But as teleworking during the coronavirus pandemic shifted work habits across Minnesota the mix at Twin Cities co-working spaces has shifted. Many of the traditional clients have returned to these flexible work environments but they are joined by a new wave of workers including some employed by large corporations and free to work from anywhere.

﻿""I don't think we'll ever going back to a time when corporate office were the primary space for teams to collaborate and connect"" said Alex Steinman co-founder and partner at the Coven a co-working officer operator in the Twin Cities that caters to mostly women. ""I think the future is co-working and we're seeing a lot of corporate organizations looking into co-working spaces as potential options for their employees.""

That model is working for Qumu a Minneapolis video-as-a-service company with 11 full-time workers in Minneapolis and 114 total. It closed all of its offices in fall 2020 and went fully remote.

But to facilitate ongoing in-person meetings post-pandemic the company contracted with Fueled Collective in Minneapolis for on-demand space for in-person meetings. Jason Karp the company's chief commercial officer says Qumu uses the space about 14 times a month.

""We still consider Minneapolis our home base and feel it's necessary to provide a physical space for in-person collaboration"" Karp said. ""It's all about empowering our employees to work in the ways that best suits each individual.""

Plus it saves the cost of fixed leases and other real estate expenses he said and eliminating daily commutes gives employees more flexibility.

The Fueled Collective has recently seen a rise in membership again. Space at Twin Ignition Startup Garage is full. Private office space at the Coven's Minneapolis office on Nicollet Avenue also is at capacity. And while membership levels at Finnovation Lab in downtown Minneapolis haven't returned to pre-pandemic levels they steadily increased in 2021.

The Coven’s 10000-square-foot location in St. Paul’s Blair Arcade.

In 2019 nearly 190000 people in Minnesota worked from home according to census data. But the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development estimates that number was 600000 in January 2021 as telecommuting had become the norm because of the pandemic.

As companies consider back to office plans many are looking at hybrid models. Co-working facilities say they are becoming part of the plan for some of the big corporations or for workers who want an office.

A July 2020 survey of Minnesota Chamber of Commerce members found 45% felt the pandemic would make remote work more permanent; 37% said it would lead to remote work being an option.

For some co-working companies said a flexible work space is ideal to strike a balance. And the memberships at co-working spaces can be more cost-effective compared to multiyear lease agreements.

As of the recent fourth quarter the asking rent price for office space in the Minneapolis market was $27.63 per square foot according to real estate service firm Cushman & Wakefield.

Meanwhile monthly memberships for Fueled Collective which operates two co-working spaces in Minneapolis start as low at $25 per month. Memberships range from full-time work to one hour a month. People also can rent space at the two spaces by the day or even the hour said Colleen Moselle president of Fueled Collective.

The Coven opened its first office in Minneapolis in 2018 and opened a 10000-square-foot location in St. Paul's Blair Arcade six weeks before the pandemic caused buildings across the metro to close in 2020. Between March and July in 2020 both locations were closed.

The day after they closed their doors though Steinman and her team created a digital community. During lockdowns the virtual hub allowed people to ""stay connected"" and offered programming around operating one's business she said. The move led to the company doubling its membership in the next four months.

Between its Minneapolis and St. Paul offices and the digital option the Coven is hovering around 1000 members.

""With kids going back to school — and we serve everyone but a lot of our members are women non-binary and trans folks who are caregivers or parents — we saw a spike in people coming in wanting to get out of their houses"" Steinman said.

Twin Ignition Ventures partners Scott Aubitz Ben Rasmussen and Seth Peter inside the Twin Ignition Startup Garage in northeast Minneapolis.

Tech entrepreneur and investor Seth Peter in 2017 founded Twin Ignition Startup Garage a co-working space in Minneapolis. The 6000-square-foot space opened in December 2019 with a few tenants but sat empty for most of 2020 because of COVID-19.

In 2021 as people began to gather again during social events such as Twin Cities Startup Week word spread of Twin Ignition's available space helping Peter and his partners sign new tenants.

Now the building is at capacity with an average of 50 people from various companies using the office on a daily basis Peter said.

""A year ago at this time people were coming into the office as little as they needed"" Peter said. ""We built up confidence with vaccinations and people were maybe just tired [of staying home]. There has been a steady build-up of people spending more time with others.""

Members even if it's for one day a week want to ""just to be able to get away here and there and be around like minded people"" he said.

The co-working spaces have instituted safety rules to keep members safe. For example the Coven and the Finnovation Lab for example both require masks and did before the city mandate. The Coven also requires proof of vaccination.

""I think we've actually maybe seen more people coming to our space because we are taking those extra precautions and people feel more safe in our space than in other spaces"" Steinman said.

Finnovation Lab the 10000-square-foot co-working space atop the Finnegans House building in downtown Minneapolis paused memberships and waived fees in 2020 ""thinking we could weather the storm"" said Connie Rutledge the space's CEO.

""We had people suspending memberships not knowing when they'd come back with offices closed and kids learning remotely"" she said.

To absorb the loss of membership revenue in 2020 Finnovation received two federal Paycheck Protection Program loans and renegotiated terms with the building's landlord Rutledge said.

In 2021 activity inside the building and membership rebounded and though membership hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels it's a vast improvement Rutledge said. Of the company's 12 private office suites nearly all are occupied.

""People need to focus and need a couple of days a week to come in to work so [they're] not distracted by household chores kids or pets or partners"" she said. ""I think that will continue. We'll see more individuals looking for solutions to revitalize their work life because I do feel like there's been a fair amount of burnout with COVID and co-working is maybe one way to shake it up a little bit.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5odW50aW5nZG9uZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3NtaXRoZmllbGQtZmlyZWZpZ2h0ZXJzLXJlY2VpdmUtdG9wLWhvbm9ycy9hcnRpY2xlXzIyNjY2OGUwLTVkYjYtNTQ5My04ZGVhLWJhYjY4NjZjYmQ2Yy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smithfield firefighters receive top honors | Local | huntingdondailynews.com,"Huntingdon PA (16652)

Fortescue paid $A309 million for the UK company which until 2019 was part of Formula 1 racing team Williams Grand Prix Engineering. William acquired its electric power plant knowledge after F1 adopted hybrid drivelines in 2014. Today’s F1 hybrids develop around 750kW.

The purchase comes in the same month as Fortescue signed up for two EV locomotives – the first to be delivered next year – to haul iron ore from its mines to ports in WA’s north-west.

This month Fortescue also signed an agreement to sell green hydrogen from its WA plant to German polymer manufacturer Covestro. Fortescue’s first hydrogen plant opened at Perth Airport in December.

It now plans a factory – expected to be the world’s biggest – in Gladstone Queensland to make electrolysers and the company plans to produce 15 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2030 much of it for export.

Fortescue has also signed a multi-billion deal to become the biggest supplier of green hydrogen to the UK supplying machinery group JCB and Ryze Hydrogen. It also has a contract with Hyzon Motors to from this year supply 10 hydrogen fuel-cell buses to its Christmas Creek mine in WA for employee transit duties.

Fortescue CEO Elizabeth Gaines said the moves were the result of the company diversifying “from a pure play iron ore producer to a green renewables and resources company.”

Williams Advanced Engineering (WAE) which built the EV drivetrains and battery systems for Fortescue’s electrified haulpak trucks will supply technology and systems for the mining company to electrify its fleet of vehicles 400-tonne trucks and 3km-long trains.

Ms Gaines said: “We have been working with WAE since early 2021 with WAE designing and building a battery system to power an electric mining haul truck; an important first step in the decarbonisation of Fortescue’s mining haul fleet.

“WAE’s expertise in battery systems and electrification further complements FFI’s green hydrogen projects for haul trucks and mobile fleet to further underpin our technical leadership.”

She said Fortescue and WAE shared strong cultural alignment “with a focus on technology and innovation to support carbon neutrality both companies being leaders in their respective industries.”

“We look forward to working together to apply this technology-first strategy to our emissions reduction pathway while also empowering the highly capable WAE team to achieve growth opportunities in new products services and markets” she said.

Fortescue founder and chairman Dr Andrew Forrest AO said: “This is the race of our lifetimes – the race to save the planet from cooking.”

“The speed at which we move matters. Together Fortescue and WAE will work to decarbonise Fortescue – with the aim of achieving that faster and more effectively than anyone else in the world.”

He said the announcement was “the key to unlocking the formula for removing fossil fuel powered machinery and replacing it with zero carbon emission technology powered by FFI green electricity green hydrogen and green ammonia.”

“For decades Sir Frank Williams’ F1 racing business was at the forefront of innovation in engineering and I thank him for his pioneering vision in founding WAE over a decade ago.

“I was sorry to hear of his passing last year and I pay tribute to him. I have huge respect for him his family and the Williams’ business.”

Following the acquisition by Fortescue Metals Group anticipated for completion in March 2022 WAE will continue to service its existing customers and commercialise new technology opportunities in addition to playing a key role in supporting Fortescue’s decarbonisation strategy.

Situated on a man-made island in the United Arab Emirates Wynn Resorts’ newest project will feature 1000-plus rooms a high-end mall restaurants lounges and more.

The project marks a big bet by Wynn on a tourism outpost halfway around the world — while back home the casino operator still hasn’t said what it will do with a big chunk of land across the street.

Wynn has teamed with developer Marjan and hotel owner RAK Hospitality Holding to build a “multibillion-dollar” resort on Al Marjan Island located in Ras Al Khaimah one of the seven emirates that comprise the UAE according to a news release Tuesday.

The project — slated to include meeting and convention space an “exclusive spa” entertainment and a “gaming area” — is scheduled to be finished in 2026 the release said.

Wynn isn’t the first Las Vegas casino company to venture to the Middle East nor is it the only one that owns a big tract of land in Southern Nevada where it could build a new hotel.

But just over four years after Wynn announced it was acquiring 38 acres next to Fashion Show mall for $336 million it still hasn’t confirmed what it will do with that property the long-vacant former home of the New Frontier.

‘Continue to evolve our ideas’

Wynn Resorts spokesman Michael Weaver said in a statement for this column that the company will be the operating partner for the UAE resort receive a management fee and hold a “minority financial interest in the project.”

He noted that Al Marjan Island is a 45-minute drive from one of the busiest airports in the world Dubai International Airport and offers a “pristine white sand beach.”

He also said 17 new hotels will open by 2024 in Ras Al Khaimah “increasing its appeal as a strong regional tourism destination.”

As for the land on Las Vegas Boulevard he said: “We continue to evolve our ideas for the 38 acres located across from Wynn Las Vegas and look forward to developing it at the appropriate time.”

In some ways this isn’t much of a surprise given the property’s history and Las Vegas’ stomach-churning experience through the pandemic.

Changing fortunes changing hands

Israeli investors bought the New Frontier in 2007 for more than $1.2 billion and imploded it with plans to develop a luxury resort. But Las Vegas’ frenzied real estate boom soon flamed out the economy crashed and the project was never built.

Australian billionaire James Packer acquired the site through foreclosure in 2014 and set out to build the 1100-room Alon Las Vegas. But Packer reportedly had trouble raising project funds and his company Crown Resorts put the land up for sale.

Wynn Resorts announced a deal in December 2017 to acquire the site and founder Steve Wynn told analysts in January 2018 that he wanted to move quickly on a project there.

Days later The Wall Street Journal reported that Wynn had a decadeslong pattern of sexual misconduct. Wynn who called the allegations “preposterous” soon resigned as chairman and CEO of his company citing “an avalanche of negative publicity.”

‘There will always be demand’

Meanwhile visitation to Las Vegas has increased dramatically from 2020 when the pandemic hit and tourism plunged but it hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels.

More than 32 million people visited America’s casino capital last year up from 19 million in 2020 but down from 42.5 million in 2019 the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported.

Asked if Wynn believes there is or will be enough demand for more megaresorts along the Strip Weaver pointed to the “incredible surge in demand for Las Vegas among domestic leisure and gaming customers in 2021” and added the company “firmly” believes Las Vegas will remain a “prime global destination for years to come.”

“And with that backdrop there will always be demand for the quality experiences that Wynn delivers” he added.

Will those experiences include a new casino across the street from its glitzy Wynn Las Vegas and Encore towers? Will that sprawling site remain an undeveloped lot for years to come?

Your guess is as good as mine.

The group is set to open a 1000+ room hotel on the man-made Al Marjan Island 15 minutes from Ras Al Khaimah International Airport and 45 minutes from Dubai International.

The development is currently scheduled to open in 2026 and will feature more than ten restaurants and lounges meeting and convention facilities a spa “world class shopping” and a gaming area.

As well as being Wynn’s first hotel in the MENA region it will also be the group’s first beach resort globally.

Wynn notes that “the new resort is in the initial stages of design and development and will be applying for an integrated resort licence from Ras Al Khaimah Tourism Development Authority”.

Al Marjan Island comprises of a group of four coral-shaped islands which are currently home to four hotels – Rixos Bab Al Bahr Doubletree by Hilton Resort and Spa Marjan Island Al Marjan Island Hotel and Spa and the recently opened Hampton by Hilton Marjan Island.

Commenting on the news Craig Billings CEO of Wynn Resorts said:

“Al Marjan Island is a pristine setting and an ideal greenfield location for us to create the one-of-a-kind guest experiences for which Wynn Resorts is renowned.

“The region offers tremendous potential for the hospitality and tourism industry and we are excited about the prospect of developing an integrated resort in Ras Al Khaimah.”

Finally Vegas has a decent selection of upscale Hilton’s in good locations to choose from. A new development called Resorts World opened last summer and contains three Hilton properties – Conrad Hilton and LXR (Crockfords). I stayed at the Conrad and Crockfords but in this review I will also cover Hilton since all the facilities are shared and I saw a few of the Hilton rooms for comparison.

Location and transport

The location of Resorts World is not ideal if you plan to go out and about a lot. It’s near Circus Circus at the northern end of the strip. There’s the legendary Peppermill opposite which is an old-school diner and cocktail lounge. It’s around 15-20 minutes walk to Encore Wynn and the Fashion Show Mall.

Now generally this wouldn’t be an issue as there’s plenty on-site. However the Uber situation is a pain in the backside. It’s fine when you get dropped off as they drop you off at reception right near the guest elevators. But when you order an Uber it’s quite a trek. You have to walk through the entire casino go outside and walk a bit further to a deserted parking lot. I was there in winter and it wasn’t much fun standing in the cold in a dimly parking lot on my own at night. Most other hotels have somewhere with patio heaters close to the entrance or in a garage. It’s worth bearing in mind that Crockfords does allow pick-ups from reception but it’s not an option in Uber so you have to message your driver. This is only for those staying at Crockfords.

Check-in

Conrad does have digitals keys so if you can get away with this I’d recommend it. There was consistently a line at reception at all times of day even though I was staying at the quietest time of the year. I have Hilton Diamond status and even in the priority queue I was waiting at least 15 minutes to speak to someone.

When I finally checked in the agent explained about the Hilton Diamond and Hilton Impressario (see below) perks which included free breakfast (up to $25pp for Hilton and $30pp for Impressario) and $100 hotel credit. The Hilton credit can be spent at any time of day but given that it was restricted to two restaurants that closed by the afternoon it was a choice of breakfast or lunch.

He neglected to mention that you had to spend the $100 all in one go which then meant I ended up wasting some of it. Plus if you are on your own $100 is quite a lot to spend in one go. This is not a requirement I have seen before. I was told I had an upgrade but in fact I hadn’t it was the standard room. I was there at a weekend so I’m guessing it was busy. Friends that arrived for a shorter stay on the Sunday were upgraded to the one-bedroom suite.

I found the Bell Desk staff quite rude. As I was only swapping from another hotel in the complex I got the Crockfords to transfer the luggage but when I went to the bell desk to say I’ve got my room number now I was frowned at. I was told I must go to my room and then call them to get the luggage even though it wouldn’t take more than two minutes to get there! This is obviously a ploy to get tips so you are in the room to give them money! Of course I did that and then no one answered the phone….However the porters themselves I encountered were all friendly and helpful.

The hotel is full of quirky artwork and Vegas momentoes like Liberace’s famous piano.

The rooms

I’ll review a few different rooms since I went back and asked to be upgraded for my last night having heard about how great the suites were from my friends. Plus I’ll take a look at the Hilton rooms. The good news is that the lifts for the hotel rooms are right by reception which is not the case in my hotels that make you walk for miles.

Conrad – Strip View Premium One Bed

All the rooms are resorts world are very similar with slightly different decor and features. The Conrad rooms feel very modern but rather masculine for my taste with the red and grey. The room was definitely a generous size but like many Vegas hotels did not have a coffee machine. This is because they want you out spending money. Instead there was a minibar and water was provided due to my status. One thing I liked which is unusual for Vegas was that the fridge had a smaller half-section as well as the minibar so you could store your own items.

I liked that there was a full-size table for eating although it was the only space to work and a bit of a stretch to the power sockets.

The bed was as comfortable as the Crockfords one and there was both USB USB-C and a normal socket by the bedside. The clock radio as had a wireless charging point on top which was clever.

There’s plenty of storage with a big closet massive chest of drawers and an area to put your case rather than use the annoying racks that can’t accommodate a two-sided case (the hotel industry needs to catch up with the fact that most larger cases are two-sided.

The bathroom felt luxurious with marble finishes although I did miss having a bath to soak my Vegas weary body in. Up until a few years ago most hotels had baths in the rooms but now they seem to be switching to shower only which is annoying. I liked the twin sink area which was well lit with a magnifying mirror as well. Strangely Conrad has a rain shower head but Crockfords which is more expensive doesn’t. There was also a seat area in the shower should you be so exhausted by Vegas you need to sit down!! It’s also handy for shaving your legs!

The toiletries in all three hotels are the same which is great for the Hilton in terms of quality. They were in large containers that could not be removed. I actually have no issue with this although it’s a bit annoying not to be able to have the body lotion by the bed where I normally put it on my hands before I go to sleep! I did like having a large bottle of handwash by the sink though as I much prefer it to soap.

The toiletries are by Byredo a luxury Swedish perfume company with toiletries starting at around £40. They are used in Emirates first class too. The Mojave Ghost fragrance is used in all the hotels to reflect the nearby Mojave Desert. There is a rare “ghost” flower in the Mojave desert that can develop with almost no water that the fragrance is named after. It is a slightly musky scent which I wasn’t particularly keen on but the products were great quality.

Conrad – one-bedroom suite

As I mentioned I managed to finally get my upgrade (I was entitled to one on both the Hilton Diamond and Impressario rates.) One tip is that if you stay for more than one night or at a busy time then you probably won’t get an upgrade. However if it is then quieter there’s nothing to stop you asking again if you don’t mind switching rooms.

Now this room was something special and if I was to stay again I’d only stay at the Conrad if I could get one of these at a decent price. It was worlds apart from the standard room. For a start it had a Nespresso coffee machine. It also had electronic curtains.

You enter into the sitting area which is enormous and had great views of the strip.

The bedroom was very similar to the previous room and both the sitting area and bedroom had huge TVs.

However there were a few more surprises in store. There was a walk-in closet with a dressing table area which I loved and was perfect for getting glammed up for a Vegas night out! The light mirror was handy too.

And finally in my bathroom I got a wonderful bath! There were also twin sinks in this bathroom and a separate shower and toilet. It was lovely that you got a little rubber duck soap for the bath an a loofah.

Hilton standard queen room

I have to say I was impressed by the Hilton rooms which are only slightly smaller than the Conrad ones. Although I’m not convinced by that carpet but it can probably hide a multitude of stains.

The bathroom was also particularly luxurious for a Hilton in fact if anything I preferred the decor to the Conrad bathroom. The only real difference was the lack of a shaving mirror.

The Hilton also has some great suites which may be a little cheaper than the Conrad. Here’s the Hilton Two Bedroom Entertainment Suite.

Food and drink

Overall there’s a lot of choice with some good options but breakfast really lets it down. Room service is also annoying. Breakfast can only be taken at Sun’s Out Bun’s Out or The Kitchen. Sun’s out Bun’s out is similar to the popular Egg Slut with egg buns of various descriptions plus burgers and avocado toast with eggs. However upmarket it is not. The other option of The Kitchen has a small buffet plus a la carte options but struggles to cope with the numbers of people leading to lengthy queues.

While Resorts World has numerous fantastic food options it lacks an upscale breakfast cafe such as Bouchon Veranda or Tableau. Every morning I was there I had a choice of stand in a queue for twenty to thirty minutes or pay a huge mark up for delivery to my room with a limited menu.

I tried Sun’s Out Bun’s Out for lunch instead one day and it was OK but nothing special and not really what I’d expect from a Conrad breakfast. You also have to pick up your orders from two different places if you order a drink. You could skip the queue if you could make do with a coffee and a donut for breakfast.

I never actually managed to last the 30 minutes to get into the Kitchen but I have not heard good reports from those that did. The main issue is that the hotel has over 3000 rooms and the capacity of the two restaurants is not nearly big enough. I estimate there are around 30 tables in The Kitchen which is just ridiculous for that many rooms. There are two Starbucks but only one was open and had huge queues.

Room service was also not great. Basically there is no traditional room service. You have to download an app that’s like Deliveroo and then order from there with a $8.50 delivery charge. You can order from anywhere in the hotel which is good but the menus are limited. For example here are the breakfast options for the Kitchen:

And as you can see from the drinks you can’t get any sort of juice or tea with your breakfast either.

I couldn’t face the whole queue situation after having headed down to check whether it would be any quieter on a Monday (not really gave up after 10 minutes of not moving in the queue) so I went for room service. One advantage is that they are quicker than other hotels with around 20-30 minutes being the average. Another thing to be wary of is that you have to tick a box to get cutlery which is not obvious and then if you forget there is no way to contact the courier. Which led to me having to try and eat noodles with my hands later on. Yuck!

As you can see it’s not the normally sort of room service presentation I’d expect from a Conrad. It was tasty enough though but then it should be at $37.88 in total! It was a breakfast burrito in case you are not sure what it was!

I also tried Wallys which is an upscale wine and truffle focussed restaurant overlooking the Sphere attraction. Wally’s also serves breakfast but only seemed to have the all day menu available when I was there. Now it opens at 7am and does offer breakfast.

I started with the Truffle Caesar salad which looked great but was a little underwhelming due to the lack of dressing and tricky to eat.

I then went for the steak tartare with caviar which I really enjoyed and felt very indulgent.

They also have a separate cheese and charcuterie menu so I would head back for that and to try some more of the wine selection since they have a great wine list with 8000 labels of wine.

There’s also Famous Foods which could loosely be described as a luxury world food court. Here high-quality stalls serve a wide variety of dishes from hand-pulled dan-dan noodles to Italian sandwiches. You can also have this delivered to your room via the Grubhub app. I tried some great Dan Dan noodles from one of the stalls. There’s also a hidden entrance to the Speakeasy bar amongst the stalls and the so-called “disco” bathroom.

I didn’t have time to sample any more restaurants but there are a plethora of choices including Italian Japanese Chin

ese or steak.

In terms of bars there’s the Crystal bar right in the center of the casino as well as Gatsby cocktail lounge and my favourite the Allē Lounge on 66 on the rooftop which has stunning 360-degree views of Vegas chilled live music and feels very upmarket. I’d say it’s one of the nicest bars I have been to in Vegas. They also serve small plate food.

The pools

The pools are one of Resorts World’s main attractions with the Vegas strip’s only infinity pool plus the largest pool complex on the Strip with seven pools in total. There’s also the family pool the Bimini game pool with submerged loungers and hot tub the main pool and a cabana pool. This is another reason I’d consider coming back.

I swam in the Bimini pool in December and it was well heated. There’s also a lovely infinity pool but you do have to rent a cabana to sit by it.

Other facilities and entertainment

I didn’t get a chance to visit the spa but it looked great and you can get a day pass for $100 if you don’t want a treatment. AWANA has six different vitality pools heated Crystal laconium room tepidarium chairs vapor-filled steam rooms cool mist showers and the experiential Rain Walk. As well as the thermal pools there is also a unique “Event sauna” where you get aromatherapy choreographed with music lighting and dancing towels for an extra $40.

In terms of entertainment they have a large theatre with big headliners doing residencies such as Katy Perry and Michael Bublé. There’s also a nightclub and a day club pool party.

Booking

I originally booked on points since I am swimming in them and had already made Diamond that year. That was when the price was around $250 a night. Then nearer the time the price plummeted to around $89 a night so it was stupid not to pay cash. However although prices are cheap you need to factor in the $45 resort fee per night and taxes. Prices start from 35000 points for the Conrad or 32000 for the Hilton. Cash prices start from around $140 for the Hilton and $160 for the Conrad mid-week.

You can search prices and book here for the Conrad. The Hilton Las Vegas website is here.

I mentioned that I had booked through Hilton Impressario. This is a service offered by luxury travel agents such as our partners GTC.

With Impressario you get added benefits and all your status perks and points. (Available on Waldorf Astoria LXR and Conrad brands).

Complimentary Breakfast for 2 people

$100 USD hotel credit per stay or local currency equivalent

Next category upgrade subject to availability

Double Hilton Honors points

The rates are higher than the cheapest advance rate but you can change up to one day before which you can’t on an advance rate.

Conclusion

I found the Conrad a mixed bag. It was definitely not up to the standard of other Conrads particularly in terms of the front desk and breakfast options. Given the low prices it was great value for money and I like some of the design features of the hotel which means that you don’t need to walk through the casino to get to reception/your room or the pools. The rooms were spacious and well equipped apart from the lack of coffee. Unless you are going to go for a suite I don’t really see the point of paying much more for the Conrad since all the facilities are the same and the rooms are only slightly smaller. Obviously you can get the Hilton Impressario deal on the Conrad which may tip the balance.

I will also be writing a short review of Crockfords as it is quite different to the Conrad and Hilton. That would probably be my first choice if I returned or one of the Conrad Suites.

Soon they might also witness a crying fit because one of the kids grabbed both cones.

Eager to capitalize on immense new interest that Max Verstappen vs. Lewis Hamilton generated F1 officials reportedly have begun detailed discussions with people in Las Vegas about bringing another race to the United States.

As exciting as it might sound to American fans of the world’s most glamorous motorsports series adding a Las Vegas Grand Prix to the schedule would bring as many negatives as positives.

Formula 1 could add a Las Vegas Grand Prix by 2023

Nevada Gov. Stephen Sisolak confirmed to Sports Business Journal in October 2021 that he spoke with Formula 1 officials about adding a Las Vegas race to the schedule by 2023 or ’24. Subsequent reports said backers attended the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin Texas on Oct. 24 to advance the conversation with F1 officials.

Now SBJ reports talks have reached the point that the sides could announce an agreement this summer with the goal of racing in 2023. If everyone signs off the race would encompass a large swath of the famed Las Vegas Strip between the Bellagio and Wynn Las Vegas.

Achieving the maximum visual effect would require racing at night. If Formula 1 schedules it for the summer then an evening event becomes a pressing requirement because of potentially scorching daytime temperatures.

Before discussing the merits of a third U.S. F1 race there is the question of cost and logistics. Even without private funding the Las Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority can write a check for $40 million or so for the sanctioning fee. However shutting down even a small piece of Las Vegas’ signature boulevard disrupts business for hotels and casinos the lifeblood of the city. Taking as much as a mile out of play for an extended period which wasn’t necessary when Caesars Palace hosted in 1981-82 would be nightmarish for the affected businesses.

Would Las Vegas be a third U.S. race or a replacement for COTA?

None of the reporting about Formula 1 potentially coming to Las Vegas refers to it as a third U.S. race. However it is the logical scenario.

The Miami Grand Prix which makes its debut on May 8 outside Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens has a 10-year contract. However Circuit of the Americas in Austin has not signed a new contract ahead of its scheduled Oct. 23 date and the speculation at times last year was that Formula 1 officials were holding Miami over COTA’s head as a threat.

Now though it seems implausible for Formula 1 to pull out of COTA. Tickets for the 2021 race weekend in Austin sold out in advance. The track well-suited for the powerful F1 cars has a decade of history behind it. Its operator would presumably fight Las Vegas to the death if confronted with an ultimatum.

Liberty Media has dragged Formula 1 into the 21st century since taking ownership in 2017 embracing social media and broadcasting to attract a larger younger audience that bodes well for long-term prosperity. Being U.S.-based the company understandably wants to exploit the largely untapped North American audience that wakes up early on Sunday mornings to watch F1 races in Europe and Asia. A third American race held in primetime checks all the boxes for continued prosperity.

A Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix would be too much of a good thing

As exciting as more Formula 1 would be for American fans its executives would risk long-term damage to a valuable commodity.

Among the issues:

Placing Las Vegas back-to-back with Miami or COTA would dilute attendance. All but the most ardent and affluent fans would choose one or the other.

Slotting Las Vegas in July or August midway between Miami and COTA to avoid overlap necessitates three annual trips to the United States a costly proposition for the 10 teams. With Mexico and Brazil the only other race venues in the Western Hemisphere at least one of the U.S. trips would be for a stand-alone race.

On top of everything else there is already concern that the season has grown too long. The 2022 schedule calls for a record 23 races.

Formula 1 officials will return to a post-pandemic China which means the schedule could soon stretch to 25 races. A 10-month schedule stretched around the globe threatens to exhaust team crews that set up and tear down complicated operations centers at each event.

Trimming the schedule potentially takes a race or two away from Europe which is the easiest continent for teams because most are based there.

So as exciting as a race weekend in Las Vegas might sound Formula 1 needs to rethink the idea.

The bump to the Minneapolis-based utility’s natural gas delivery costs would be its first such increase in 15 years a step the company said is important for addressing significant customer growth in North Dakota and to ensure safe and reliable heating. But their request also comes at an inopportune time for natural gas customers: The volatile commodity’s price hit some of the highest points in a decade last fall  and North Dakotans are still paying off the state’s $50 million tab from last year’s Texas freeze which sent natural gas prices through the roof.

“Quite honestly the timing is really unfortunate” said Public Service Commission Chair Julie Fedorchak who said state regulators will vet Xcel’s request and look for ways to cut it down in the upcoming rate case.

Of North Dakota’s three regulated natural gas providers Xcel customers felt the biggest blow from the Texas cold snap  a result of the large volumes of gas the utility had to buy off the spot market over four unusual days last February. Xcel racked up nearly $33 million in costs from the February freeze or about $240 for the average household — a price tag that prompted the PSC to call the utility back for a special investigation before ultimately approving its plan to recover those costs by spreading them out over two years.

While North Dakotans will be feeling the costs of the February storm for months more utilities aren’t allowed to make profits off the sale of the natural gas itself. Fedorchak noted Xcel was likely gearing up for its request well before last year’s winter storm and said the commission has to keep in mind the costs for Xcel to safely and reliably heat North Dakota homes.

The PSC which oversees the state’s three regulated natural gas providers will hold hearings later this year on whether to grant Xcel’s request which totals $7.1 million and comes out to an increase of about $5.80 on the average household’s monthly bill. The regulatory body is scheduled to field public input on the request during two virtual meetings on Wednesday Feb. 2.

Xcel has already been approved for an interim rate hike a cost of about $5.50 a month to the average household which went into effect in November. Though the PSC holds the authority to deny the utility’s request outright such an outcome is extremely rare and Fedorchak said their decision will more likely be a matter of degrees.

Why the increase?

Xcel is seeking an increase to its fixed charge for the delivery of natural gas the section of the customer bills from which the utility is legally allowed to collect profits. The majority of customer costs result from what’s known as the “pass through” price of the gas itself from which the utility can’t make any money and which can fluctuate substantially from one day to the next.

Chris Clark the president of Xcel Energy for Minnesota and the Dakotas said much of the utility’s request is aimed at addressing a 40% increase in its North Dakota customer base since their last rate case largely the result of the utility’s expansions into new and growing areas of eastern North Dakota like the town of Horace .

The company also notes in filings before the PSC that most of its request addresses needed updates to ensure reliable delivery of natural gas work that includes renewing old pipeline infrastructure and refurbishing three natural gas peaking plants.

“I think it's important to remember that it's been 15 years since we've filed a rate case in North Dakota” Clark said. “Over those 15 years we've provided a great value for our customers but at the same time we recognize the need to make additional investments in our system to be able to provide that strong safe reliable service for the next decade and beyond.”

Still one North Dakota group representing ratepayers argued Xcel is asking for more than it needs noting increases to fixed charges make it more difficult for customers to control their energy bills.

Josh Askvig state director for AARP of North Dakota which intervened last year in a rate case for Montana-Dakota Utilities called Xcel’s requested 10.5% increase “one of the most egregious we’ve seen around the country this year” and said the utility’s $18.48 base rate is already too high. Xcel is also requesting a decrease to its return on equity a figure used to calculate the fixed rate change from 10.75% to 10.5% — a level Askvig said still puts it ""on the very high end"" nationwide.

On top of the $7.1 million base rates increase Xcel is looking to apply $1.25 million in holdover costs from the cleanup of an old natural gas plant in Fargo  an addition PSC public utility analyst Victor Schock said comes out to roughly 60 cents a month for the average household.

In Xcel’s two most recent North Dakota rate cases in 2004 and 2007 North Dakota customers saw an aggregate increase to their natural gas delivery rates of 3.3% according to numbers provided by the utility. That compares to a 4.3% total increase between 2004 and 2010 for Xcel’s customers in Minnesota the most recent approved increases there.

Fedorchak noted Xcel’s fixed rates help cover the costs of its pipes in the ground and the safety of gas transportation adding “you really can't shortchange your gas system.” But she also said the PSC will aim to shave the rate increase down to ""as little as possible.""

“We always aim to significantly decrease what the company is asking for” she said.

If you go

The PSC will hold two virtual public input sessions on the Xcel request Wednesday Feb. 2 at Noon and 5:30 p.m. Customers can watch the sessions at psc.nd.gov/public/meetings/live.php or listen over the phone by calling 1-888-585-9008 room code 671-872-185.

Those wishing to comment should call the PSC at 701-328-4081 to be placed on a list.

Written comments can also be submitted between Feb. 2 and Feb. 9 by email to ndpsc@nd.gov or by mail to Public Service Commission 600 E. Boulevard Ave. Dept. 408 Bismarck ND 58505.

Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Xcel is seeking an increase to its return on equity in North Dakota a figure used to calculate the company's fixed rates. Xcel is requesting a decrease to its return on equity from 10.75% to 10.5%.

BOULDER COUNTY Colo. — One month ago the Marshall Fire destroyed more than 1000 homes and businesses in Superior Louisville and unincorporated Boulder County.

The fire started just after 11 a.m. Dec. 30 near Marshall Road and Highway 93 in Boulder County. One person was killed and another is still missing after the fire which was the most destructive in Colorado history.

The cause of the fire is still in question. Was it a fire on a property where the religious group Twelve Tribes had been burning trash out in the open the week before? Was it an issue with power lines even though Xcel Energy said none came down? Or did an underground coal mine fire smoldering for decades make its way to the surface?

There's no doubt though about what turned that first spark into a massive fire. Winds topping 100 miles per hour fanned the flames. Extremely dry grass offered plenty of fuel. Once the flames reached the first home researchers said the rest went like dominoes.

Over the next three hours evacuations expanded east into the hearts of Louisville and Superior. But 9NEWS has learned not many people actually got the message.

Only one in five people who should have gotten the emergency alert confirmed they did. Many others had to rely on a heads-up from a friend or neighbor or a deputy knocking on their door.

Boulder County relied on a system that only alerted cell phone users if they opted in before the fire. The county was approved in 2019 to use a system that would have alerted all phones but never finished setting it up. The emergency manager blamed a series of disasters.

Recovering from Colorado's most destructive fire on record will be a long road but help and hope are all around.

""It brought us together"" fire survivor Tracey Meyers said. ""We know people we didn't know before. People are helping people.""

On Monday Boulder County Sheriff's Office said most of the initial investigative work was nearing completion including evidence gather photos interviews as well as reviewing videos and information from community tips.

The investigation is now pending the conclusions and reports from several experts and labs which the sheriff's office said could take weeks or months.

The summer 2022 tour will feature special guests and long-time companions Ani DeFranco Brittany Howard Celisse Indigo Girls Lake Street Drive Lucius Sarah McLachlan and Allison Russell.

The tour kicks off at Gorge Amphitheater in George Washington featuring Sarah McLachlan Lucius and Celisse. A special guest will be featured at nearly every location – click here to see who will be coming to your city.

Revitalized in multicolored ‘50s Elvis-inspired suits Carlile brings old-school rock and roll glam and marries it perfectly to her Americana roots in her new album “In These Silent Days.”

Carlile told Apple Music her 7th studio album was written in quiet reflection in the woods near her cabin in the Cascades. As a traveling artist during the COVID-19 crisis Carlile and other touring artists retreated to their homes away from the crowds and away from the fast-paced beat of their everyday musical world.

“I realized how much affirmation I get from strangers other people how dependent I’ve been on it since I was 8 years old—that life-affirming response that you get from an audience when you perform” she said.

Fighting the quiet of the woods she said the stillness while much needed was a tough change of pace. In her time away from the stage Carlile maybe unwillingly at times began a renewed journey of self-discovery eventually leading to the creation of her new album and the writing of her memoir and album single “Broken Horses.”

“Broken Horses the reason I named it after the book is that the book just unlocked so many emotions for me and gave me so much perspective and allowed me to not feel shame about the things I was feeling” she said.

“With Broken Horses I realized after some reflection I had some really righteous anger about the way that I’ve come up in this world as a queer person and the ways that’s affected my marriage my family my faith. And I wanted to scream about it a little bit.”

In the process of returning to herself with the album Carlile wants the album to be just as much an exploration process for the listener to ignite the self-reflection journey for her audience with a question rather than trying to provide an answer or solution for the trying times.

“That’s why it’s ‘In These Silent Days.’ It’s a question: What did you learn? What did you make of yourself? What did you lose? What happened to you in this time? I want to invite people to reflect because it’s such a pivotal time in human history and a real spiritual upheaval for so many people in really positive and really negative complicated ways.”

Many locations are currently sold out and limited seating is available – grab your tickets here or through Carlile’s website.

Dashcam footage of the incident which happened on May 4 2020 shows the terrifying near-tragedy.

The young girl’s dad initially stopped Boyce from going further by putting his hand on the bonnet - but the reckless driver quickly revved his engine and sped off.

Footage of the incident was released on social media at the time in an attempt to identify the driver - which later led to Boyce handing himself in.
