By the end of the night 16-year-old Matteo Santoro outdid his double-gold-medal performance at last year’s junior world championships by winning his third gold medal in the 2022 edition in the synchronised platform in an older age group.

A few hours before that 15-year-old Alexa Fung of Canada eclipsed her big sister’s silver medal from Tuesday by winning gold on the 1m springboard.

In between on the platform 15-year-old Ukrainian phenom Kirill Boliukh won his second gold medal to go with his 3m title.

Boliukh tried for a third victory about an hour later and had he and his boys’ synchro platform partner succeeded and beaten Santoro’s duo (in the event where age groups are mixed) then Boliukh – not Santoro – would have been the undisputed king of these championships. Here’s how it all went down.

Girls 1m Springboard final (Group B – ages 14-15)

Alexa Fung brought Canada it’s third gold medal of these championships on Friday in the girls’ 1m final for ages 14-15. Not only that she earned bragging rights by doing one better than her sister Katelyn who earned a silver medal on Tuesday in the 3m event for ages 16-18.

“Runs in the family I guess” Alexa said when asked how she managed to lead all three rounds of the final and defeat the top qualifier Molly Gray of the US by 9.3 points.

After prelims Fung said she knew she had a “pretty decent” chance at a medal “but I didn’t have THAT high of expectations. I was glad I was second-to-last [in the final start order]. I hate being last.” And while her final dive didn’t earn her the most points the 15-year-old who trains in Toronto said “the back 1½ is a good one to end on. It’s not scary. It’s not too hard. It’s just like chill.”

Gray the silver-medalist said that going into the final “I really just wanted to keep a positive mindset and keep my composure.” To do that she said “I try to take deep breaths and only really focus on what’s to come and stop worrying about the past.”

The 15-year-old from Walnut Creek California admitted that she does keep an eye on the scores during competition. “It kinda motivates me in a way to do better.”

Bronze medalist Giorgia De Sanctis of Italy said “No no” she didn’t think a medal was possible going into the final. Instead she thought a top-5 finish was realistic for her junior world championship debut.

The 15-year-old who trains in Rome said she had been inspired by Santoro’s two gold medals earlier in the week but he didn’t give her any advice. “I stayed relaxed and didn’t think of anything when I’m on the springboard” she said. “I’m very happy and I’m so excited.”

Boys Platform final (Group B – ages 14-15)

Image Source: FINA/Antoine Saito

The 14- to 15-year-old boys platform final was intriguing because the top two contenders (Joshua Hedberg and Kirill Boliukh) both had senior world championship experience – and the difficult high-quality dives to prove it.

In the end Kirill Boliukh of Ukraine won the gold medal matching his gold from Monday’s 3m event. He led after each dive in the four-round final defeating the surprise silver medalist Jorden Fisher-Eames of Great Britain by a whopping 34 points thanks in part to his ability to nail the hardest dive in the contest – a forward 4 ½ that carried a 3.7 degree of difficulty.

Boliukh actually aced it twice on Friday – first in prelims (for 85.10 points) then in the final for 92.50 points. Afterwards the 15-year-old had to quickly prep for another final the 3m synchro event starting about an hour later where he teamed up with Ukraine’s other gold medalist from these championships Kyrylo Azarov.

Silver medalist Fisher-Eames 14 of Great Britain though had time to talk. Fifth after the first round he climbed to third stayed in third then advanced to second place on his final dive a back 2 ½ with 1½ twists which earned 76.80 points. “It’s just a fun little dive” he said.

Before the final “I didn’t really have a place in mind I just let it go let it happen” he said. Fisher-Eames started diving when he was 5 and quit other sports when he was 7 or 8 he said because “I knew I wasn’t going to get anywhere in football.” His little sister Skye also dives but none of his family was in Montreal so he planned to relay the news via FaceTime. Will they be stunned? “Yeah I think so” he said.

Hedberg the top qualifier from the US was in silver-medal position with one dive to go. His final dive was one of his hardest carrying a 3.6 DD (a back 2 ½ with 2 ½ twists). “Unfortunately I had a bad take-off which led to the dive being short” he said explaining that when he bent down he was leaning a little too far back and it messed up the entry. “I knew it immediately.”

Instead he took the bronze his third medal of the championships. (He also won team gold on Sunday and synchro platform bronze on Wednesday).

Boys Synchronised 3m (ages 14-18)

Image Source: FINA/Antoine Saito

The boys’ synchro 3m event was another intense battle this time between Italy and Croatia. Italy led after the first three rounds but Croatia battled back in the fourth pulling ahead of Italy by 3.84 points. By then Ukraine had long faded down to eighth. And since there was no preliminary – just an 18-team final – the potential bronze medalists were scattered all over the start list which only added suspense as everyone waited to see whose scores would hold.

Image Source: FINA/Antoine Saito

Ultimately Italy saved its best dive for last an easy-ish inward 2 ½ which scored 71.10 points while Croatia scored 64.26 on its harder forward 2½ with 2 twists. And with that Matteo Santoro 16 has his third gold medal of the championships aided by Stefano Belotti 18 his synchro partner of five months. “I really had fun this competition” Santoro said.

Croatia’s Matej Nevescanin and David Ledinski took the silver exactly three points short of the win. Backstage the taller Nevescanin was visibly upset. It was his second junior world championships and it was three days shy of his 16th birthday.

But Ledinski 18 was pleased. “I didn’t perform very well in 1-meter and 3-meter and then this synchro – it’s amazing” he said. “It was so close. To be honest after we did the last dive we thought we were going to be first. But then the Italians did an amazing dive and congratulations to them.”

As for Nevescanin who walked away and put his head against a wall Ledinski said “He is overwhelmed. But at the same time he is happy and sad because we thought we were going to be first. We really wanted to sing an anthem.”

In all Croatia had six athletes diving in Montreal but three flew home on Friday so only one teammate was in the stands to see Nevescanin and Ledinski take silver.

The bronze went to British 17-year-olds Leon Baker and Hugo Thomas who had been synchro partners for a year despite training in different cities. Baker said “Every so often I’ll come to London and train with him or he’ll come down to Southampton. I think as a team we’re sort of relaxed. We don’t really have problems and such.” As for the podium Baker said “It was a tough competition against everybody really. It did look like Croatia were gonna win it.”

“But we were quite confident” Thomas interjected “because at our European junior championship [in July] we got silver” behind the Italians and ahead of the Croatians “so we knew on a good day we could be up there with them.”

Boliukh and Azarov finished seventh for Ukraine. Boliukh’s parents had been watching online. He knew because his mother texted him after he had won his second gold medal on Friday on platform. She wrote “Congratulations my son my sunshine.” And after Monday’s gold on 3m she wrote “Congratulations on your victory. I am proud of you. It was cool to see and beautiful to see.”

Next for the Ukrainian prodigy? “Practice practice practice” he said. “Next year I am moving to Group A bigger boys serious business serious dives.” He is already doing big dives of course but he can’t relax if he wants to compete with these young men.

Greg Abbott bans TikTok on state devices,"“TikTok harvests vast amounts of data from its users' devices"" Abbott said.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott directed state agencies on Wednesday to ban the use of social media platform TikTok on government-issued devices over concerns about how the China-owned app handles data on American infrastructure and other sensitive information.

""TikTok harvests vast amounts of data from its users' devices -- including when where and how they conduct internet activity -- and offers this trove of potentially sensitive information to the Chinese government"" Abbott said in a letter to state officials on Wednesday.

TikTok has faced growing scrutiny from state and federal officials over fears that American data could fall into the possession of the Chinese government.

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita sued TikTok on Wednesday for allegedly misleading users about the Chinese government's capacity to access their data and showing mature content to minors. It marks the first state lawsuit against the app.

TikTok provided ABC News with a statement after Indiana sued the company.

""While we don't comment on pending litigation the safety privacy and security of our community is our top priority. We build youth well-being into our policies limit features by age empower parents with tools and resources and continue to invest in new ways to enjoy content based on age-appropriateness or family comfort. We are also confident that we're on a path in our negotiations with the U.S. Government to fully satisfy all reasonable U.S. national security concerns and we have already made significant strides toward implementing those solutions"" the statement read.

On Tuesday Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced a similar prohibition on TikTok as well as Chinese technology makers like Huawei and ZTE from use on state business.

The TikTok logo is seen on a cellphone on Oct. 14 2022 in Boston. Michael Dwyer/AP FILE

In a statement a response to Hogan's ban TikTok said in a statement to ABC News: ""We believe the concerns driving these decisions are largely fueled by misinformation about our company. We are happy to continue having constructive meetings with state policymakers to discuss our privacy and security practices. We are disappointed that many state agencies offices and universities will no longer be able to use TikTok to build communities and connect with constituents.""

Last month a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission called on the U.S. government to ban the social media platform.

The Biden administration and TikTok wrote up a preliminary agreement to address national security concerns posed by the app but obstacles remain in the negotiations The New York Times reported in September.

TikTok says that it stores the data of U.S. users outside of China and has never removed U.S. posts from the platform at the request of the Chinese government.

Recent news stories have called into question the security of user data.

Buzzfeed reported in June that TikTok engineers based in China gained access to intimate information on U.S. users such as phone numbers. Forbes reported in October that ByteDance TikTok's parent company intended to use the app to access information on some users.

The Trump administration tried to ban TikTok in 2020 eventually calling on ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company. However the sale never took place.

Abbott sends buses from Texas,"People embracing after the bus arrived at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia; the bus was sent by Gov. Abbott in Texas on Nov. 21. Read more

So far five unscheduled buses carrying more than 200 immigrants from Texas have pulled up in Philadelphia targeted by Gov. Greg Abbott because it’s a sanctuary city.

The biggest surprise to activists here? That it took him so long.

Because Philadelphia is not just a sanctuary city. It stands among the strongest and toughest sanctuary cities.

The Kenney administration fought and won a major lawsuit over President Donald Trump’s effort to make local police enforce federal immigration laws kicked ICE out of a database it believed the agency was using to find undocumented people and barred city employees from asking residents about their immigration status.

That stance has not only been supported but demanded by Philadelphia’s robust network of immigrant-rights groups who push for official action even as they take on the hard day-to-day job of supporting newcomers. At one point in 2019 more undocumented families had taken refuge in sanctuary churches in Philadelphia than in any city in the country assisted by advocates in putting themselves beyond the reach of ICE to block their deportations.

“It is a clear and consistent message from the city of Philadelphia that immigrant communities are welcome here” said Peter Pedemonti codirector of New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia which worked round-the-clock to help families in church sanctuary. “The city has stood strong on this.”

Being a “sanctuary city” means different things in different places but in Philadelphia a major aspect is that local police officers do not help ICE round up arrest and remove undocumented immigrants.

City officials say that’s the job of the federal government. And that crime victims and witnesses won’t come forward if they fear deportation.

Now Philadelphia finds itself under new pressure added to a list with three other cities that Abbott designated as drop-off points for his Texas busing campaign. Since spring he’s sent about 13300 immigrants from the U.S.-Mexico line to New York Chicago and Washington saying the state’s overwhelmed border communities need relief.

Immigration advocates call it a cheap political stunt that seeks only to harm and disrupt but the impact has been real.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a public health emergency and New York City Mayor Eric Adams a state of emergency to help handle the influx of thousands of people. Philadelphia city and immigrant leaders are considering asking for state and federal aid with more buses expected to arrive from Del Rio Texas.

Almost all of those arriving in Philadelphia on buses are seeking asylum a legal means of staying in the United States for those facing persecution in their homelands.

It’s important for people to understand that those coming here have been scrutinized and vetted by border authorities before being allowed to move on said Juan Giarrizzo executive director of Gente de Venezuela in Philadelphia.

He fights to counter the conservative narrative that immigration equates to criminality that it’s a detriment and not a benefit to American society. In fact major cities like Philadelphia depend on immigrants to grow businesses and jobs.

Many who have come here have fled danger to seek freedom and opportunity. “If we had to uproot our lives and our families to create a better future” said Laila Sadat the city deputy communications director “we would hope that others would treat us with dignity and respect.”

The concept of sanctuary is as old as the Bible with the “six cities of refuge” described in the Old Testament. It ran through ancient Greece and Rome and became widely known through Victor Hugo’s The Hunchback of Notre-Dame in which Quasimodo rescues Esmeralda from the gallows and spirits her into safety in the cathedral.

Today about 200 cities counties and states are sanctuary jurisdictions though many do not use the term. Philadelphia for instance officially describes itself as a “Welcoming City” where newcomers seeking a better life are treated the same as everyone else.

Almost all sanctuary cities are Democratic enclaves deplored by Republicans who insist the lack of cooperation with federal authorities endangers law-abiding Americans.

“Mayor Jim Kenney” Abbott said in announcing Philadelphia as a destination last month “has long celebrated and fought for sanctuary city status.”

He’s right about that.

Only hours after taking office in January 2016 Kenney restored a policy that barred almost all cooperation between city law enforcement and federal immigration agents.

A year later his administration sued then-President Trump a case that turned on a relatively small amount of money — about $1.5 million in federal grants to a city with a $4.4 billion budget — but a big principle: whether Trump could withhold funding if the city did not make its police officers help ICE arrest undocumented people.

A key issue was the city’s refusal to honor ICE detainers which are agency-issued requests to hold people in custody until agents can arrest them. Trump’s representatives argued that Philadelphia was releasing dangerous “criminal aliens” who should have been turned over to ICE agents.

Philadelphia officials said they honor detainers that come accompanied by signed judicial warrants but otherwise had no authority to keep anyone in custody beyond the release date set by the court.

Nearly a year of litigation and a four-day trial resulted in U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson ruling for Philadelphia in June 2018 saying that city policies were reasonable rational and equitable.

The next month — amid loud demands by Juntos and other immigrant-rights groups — Kenney announced he would not renew a controversial city contract that lets ICE agents access the PARS computer system.

The real-time database collected no data on immigration status but did note country of origin. Each day the Kenney administration said ICE probed PARS to find and investigate people who were born outside the United States.

For immigrant groups the city’s action marked a turning point.

“Ending agreements with ICE when I first started at Juntos people thought it was an impossibility” said Erika Almirón who led the Latino-rights group during its PARS campaign and is now senior organizer at Mijente.

Those years of immigrant-led battles to solidify Philadelphia’s sanctuary standing play an important role now as the city welcomes bus passengers because it strengthened relationships among the members of immigrant-aid groups.

They came to know and trust one another even as they found themselves competing for grants and funding said Lucy Rabbaa director of social services at HIAS Pennsylvania.

Those ties enabled 20 representatives of different organizations to connect in an urgent Zoom meeting as word spread that a bus — what would be the first on Nov. 16 — was headed here from Texas. They set plans to have volunteers on site and to provide goods like blankets and hygiene kits to passengers.

“If we hadn’t done this work in the past collaborating organizing” Rabbaa said “we would probably not be able to pull this off in a short amount of time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd2N3LXRhbmstYWJib3R0LWhvdy1waW5uZWQtaG9wZXMtb24tZm9ybWVyLXVmYy1maWdodGVyLWZhaWxlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tank Abbott: How WCW Pinned Their Hopes On A Former UFC Fighter (& Failed),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd2N3LXRhbmstYWJib3R0LWhvdy1waW5uZWQtaG9wZXMtb24tZm9ybWVyLXVmYy1maWdodGVyLWZhaWxlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C49093CF70>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

9 million student-loan borrowers received an email in late November with a subject line that their debt relief had been approved.

It should have stated the applications had been received not approved — an error made by an Education Department contractor.

The content of the email was accurate but the contractor of the department will soon issue corrections.

Millions of student-loan borrowers will soon receive an updated email on the status of their debt relief.

Over November 22 and 23 approximately 9 million borrowers received an email from President Joe Biden's Education Department with a subject line that stated: ""Your Student Loan Debt Relief Application Has Been Approved."" However that subject line was incorrect Insider has learned — it was simply supposed to inform borrowers that their applications had been received with the subject line: ""Update on Student Loan Debt Relief.""

This error was made by Accenture Federal Services which is a contractor of the department that sent the email communications. While the content of the email was accurate and provided borrowers an update that debt relief is currently held up in court and loans cannot be discharged at this time Accenture on behalf of the department will be sending new emails with a corrected subject line to those impacted borrowers in the coming days.

Stacey Jones senior managing director and head of corporate communications for Accenture told Insider in a statement that the company ""regrets the human error that led to an email being sent to a number of student loan debt relief applicants with an inaccurate subject line.""

""The email was sent on behalf of the Department of Education on Nov. 22 and 23"" she continued. ""Working closely with the Department Accenture Federal Services will review quality control measures to support accurate and timely communications to applicants in the Student Loan Debt Relief program.""

An Education Department spokesperson also told Insider in a statement that ""communicating clearly and accurately with borrowers is a top priority of the Department.""

""We are in close touch with Accenture Federal Services as they take corrective action to ensure all borrowers and those affected have accurate information about debt relief"" the spokesperson said.

The department has previously indicated that 26 million student-loan borrowers had already submitted applications for debt relief. However since October the option to submit an application has been closed due to two legal decisions so far that have blocked the implementation of the relief. The first ruling came from a Texas judge last month who said Biden's plan to cancel student debt is illegal and just days later the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals decided the temporary pause it had placed on the relief in October will remain in place.

Biden's Justice Department has since asked the Supreme Court to intervene in both cases. On Thursday the Court agreed to hear arguments for the lawsuit brought to the 8th Circuit in February and it has not yet indicated how it will approach the lawsuit the Texas judge ruled on. It's likely the Supreme Court could choose to combine both of the cases and hear arguments for them early next year.

In light of the lawsuits Biden recently extended the pause on student-loan payments through June 30 or whenever the lawsuits are resolved — whichever comes first. The administration also continues to express confidence that it will prevail in court and stands behind the authority it used under the HEROES Act of 2003 to enact one-time debt relief for millions of borrowers.

""Our student debt relief program is necessary to help 40M eligible Americans struggling under the burden of student loan debt recover from the pandemic"" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona wrote on Twitter on Thursday. ""That's 40M borrowers who chased the American dream through higher education. I look forward to SCOTUS hearing our case.""

Organizations have over the years made a conscious effort towards enabling people with disabilities at the workplace – including in a hybrid setup during the pandemic. This focus is no longer merely for driving inclusivity but also to encourage diverse ideas and thoughts.

For International Day of PwD we reached out to industry thought-leaders to understand how their companies are enabling PwD talent.

Ruhi Ranjan Inclusion & Diversity Sponsor Accenture in India

“Across the world there are over a billion people who experience some form of visible or invisible disability and the entire ecosystem needs to do more to boost their participation in the workforce.

At Accenture we continue to strengthen our long-standing commitment of hiring and growing persons with disabilities. Each of our businesses has a dedicated recruitment team focused on persons with disabilities. We partner with specialized external organisations participate in niche job fairs have a robust employee referral program to boost hiring and run a six-month long Inclusive Internship program to build a skilled talent pool in this segment.

We are equally focused on strengthening a culture of equality where our people with disabilities feel included and can thrive. We give our people access to a range of technologies and accessibility enablement such as assistive devices and technologies ergonomic support flex work arrangements sign language interpreters and more to create a barrier-free workplace. Our progressive medical insurance program supports enablement such as assistive devices. Our workplace applications and platforms are developed to be accessible by design.

In order to help our persons with disabilities build fulfilling careers we leverage a customized career path framework that identifies various interventions required at various stages of their career at Accenture and builds levers to create a level playing field. For example our ‘Abilities Unleashed’ program helps our persons with disabilities become authentic leaders and effective role models through capability development and mentoring.

We encourage open dialogue about disabilities inclusion and accessibility and drive sensitization to eliminate bias. Our network of more than 35000 Persons with Disabilities Champions across the world plays a key role in evangelisation of PwD inclusion.”

Shweta Mohanty Head – HR SAP Labs India.

“At SAP we have always been committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment where people with disabilities have access to equal opportunities. We believe that by focusing on people’s strengths rather than their differences we are well positioned to deliver on SAP’s vision to help the world developed run better and improve lives. Bringing on board a diverse talent not just broadens our workforce strength but also helps us drive innovation at scale.

As an example our ‘Autism at Work’ program highlights the valuable skill sets that people with autism can offer and create an impact. With support from our local partners we were able to integrate Autism at Work into the mainstream company processes and able to achieve ~90% retention of the employees in the program. Not only do we hire but through the Autism support circle an eco-system of coaching mentoring and holistic growth and inclusion of each individual is established to ensure sustained scalability. As one of the first corporates in India to introduce such an initiative we look forward to taking precedence in the conversations around inclusion of people with disabilities at workplace. We realize that empathy and openness can help us become not just a better company but also a successful one.

Over the years our eyes have been continuously opened to more possibilities than originally anticipated by witnessing the contributions of our Autism at Work employees at SAP. Our colleagues have filed for patents dramatically redesigned processes represented in the UN and attained countless other achievements.

We go beyond hiring numbers to measure success of our diversity efforts as inclusion is about being belonged and respected. We conduct sensitization sessions for our employees to be more aware of the concerns of the differently abled. We have conducted an accessibility audit and made the necessary infrastructural changes to ensure an Accessible and Inclusive environment. We encourage the teams to use ALT Text to ensure colleagues with visual disability understand image in an email.

At SAP we continuously strive to ensure that all our facilities technologies information and privileges are accessible to people with disabilities. Our Equal Opportunity Policy ensures we have the framework processes and leadership commitment to ensure a fair and equal workplace for All”

Sandhya Ramesh Lead – Diversity Equity & Inclusion Great Place To Work

“For centuries now Persons with Disabilities (PwD’s) have been trying to find a space in Indian societies where able-bodied individuals view and treat them as contributing citizens of the country. Although average PwD representation continues to be less than 1% in the organized sector organizations who have consistently invested in disability inclusion have been able to experience improvements like larger talent pools enhanced productivity better experience for both employees and customers as well as improved mechanisms to manage conflicts strikes and lockouts.

However extreme and unpredictable weather events that can occur as a result of climate change such as widespread wildfires lengthy droughts major hurricanes and severe winter storms have also proven to be a significant risk. Their residual effects have already been felt across the supply chain and within the shipping experience.

According to a UPS Capital report 75% of merchants have experienced an increase in damaged expired or lost packages due to severe weather events over the last 12 months. This increase is so pronounced that many believe this threat is just getting started as climate change is a slow-moving crisis that is likely to gain momentum for years to come. In fact the same report found that nearly all merchants (92%) anticipate an increase in shipping and delivery issues due to climate change over the next five years.

With peak season ramping up and the Farmer’s Almanac forecasting a turbulent winter it’s important to invest in safeguards that can protect shipments against the havoc that climate change can bring—now and in the future.

Protecting warehouse inventory from damage

The US Census Bureau estimated that retailers’ inventory stockpiles exceed $550 billion this peak season due to fears over last year’s mass shortages. Unfortunately inventory at rest in a warehouse is vulnerable to climate-related risks such as fires and floods. This is especially true in higher risk areas like California or Florida that are more susceptible to natural disasters.

Not only is there risk of massive loss should an unruly weather event occur but aggregate inventory can also have insurance policy limitations surrounding the amount of inventory being held and the time it has sat idle. Therefore the loss may not even be adequately covered putting the merchant on the line and in the hole.

Circumventing shipping and delivery delays

Climate change has made severe weather a worldwide issue causing global supply chain shipping challenges like port shutdowns longer freight routes and last mile delays. Merchants who rely on just one supply chain line are most likely to be affected by weather delays or halts that influence their only supply source.

For example weeks of drought across Europe this summer created supply chain problems for major waterways like Germany’s Rhine River. While most vessels were forced to lighten their loads to ensure they could travel along depleted water channels some vessels still couldn’t sail even when they were empty—causing bottlenecks on one of the country's main commercial routes and delaying shipments worldwide.

During the holiday season when deliveries have a drop-dead date merchants could face negative repercussions to both their reputation and bottom line should inventory not arrive in time (or at all). It’s imperative to diversify supply sources so that there’s multiple lines of inventory coming in—helping to avoid being left high and dry in the event of complications.

Investing in weather stabilizing shipment packaging

According to UPS Capital’s 2022 State of Shipping report 77% of shoppers now believe that extra steps are needed to protect their orders from weather issues due to climate change. Merchants and other supply chain players should be investing in solutions like weather-stabilizing shipment packaging to offset the potential for an increase in damaged or expired packages especially for more sensitive items like electronics or pharmaceuticals. In addition to express shipping and insulated containers shipments can also include materials that stabilize the temperature to protect items against extreme cold or heat.

Understanding the greater need for shipment insurance

As the weather becomes more unpredictable and disasters become more frequent as the result of climate change such events are likely to have a greater impact on the supply chain. According to Climate.gov the U.S. had the second-most climate disasters (20) in 2021 just behind 22 in 2020.

It’s important for merchants to safeguard themselves from these growing risks by investing in peace of mind through the right shipping insurance.

“By showing his humanity his family we were able to illustrate exactly what was at stake for him and exactly what he was sacrificing for the cause of Russian democracy and the freedom of Russia” he said. “And that’s why it was paramount to not just have this film be a political film or not just have this film be the murder mystery but to really at its heart make a film about a family man make this film a love story between Yulia and Alexei.”

Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev spoke about how he felt during one of the film’s most memorable scenes when Navalny impersonated a Russian official to trick one of the conspirators into giving him information about his own assassination.

“My God this guy’s giving us much more data than we even had before the beginning of the phone call to somewhere midway through the call I was starting to feel pity for him and sorry” Grozev said. “I’m thinking what have we done to this killer or one of the killers? And then towards the end I was already kind of jaded and thinking ‘OK I peaked. I’m never gonna see anything as good as this in my life. So what else is there to do for the rest of my life?’”

Despite being evacuated to Germany for medical treatment following the attempt on his life Navalny made the choice to return to Russia where he was immediately arrested and sentenced to nine years in a maximum-security prison.

Russian investigative journalist Maria Pevchikh shared what his imprisonment has been like.

“He has been moved permanently to solitary confinement” she said. “He spends his day in a tiny little prison cell three-by-four meters. …The room consists of a bed that has been chained up to the wall every morning at 6 a.m. He has a small table and a stool without a back. So that’s his life at the moment and the biggest struggle that he’s going through at the moment is that as opposed to all of the other inmates he isn’t allowed winter shoes.”

Somebody wanted it and he happens to be the most exciting hire the school could have possibly made.

Deion Sanders is coming to Boulder.

It hardly seems reals. Of all people the former NFL and Major League baseball star the guy in the AFLAC commercials actually wants to take over the Pac-12’s most beleaguered football program. Coach Prime whose Jackson State team is 23-2 the past two seasons and who convinced the No. 1 recruit in the country to sign with an FCS school is coming to the rescue of a program that has had two winning seasons in the past 17 years.

It’s the most exciting thing to happen to Colorado football since Kordell Stewart to Michael Westbrook.

“I don’t think I can express in words how big this is for the Colorado football program” said former Buffaloes quarterback and current Fox Sports analyst Joel Klatt. “This is a really proud program that desperately needs someone like Deion for energy notoriety and exposure.”

Last spring I interviewed a bunch of former Colorado coaches players and administrators for a story on the 20-year demise of the one-time powerhouse. They spoke proudly of the Buffs’ rise to the top of the sport in the 1990s under program savior Bill McCartney but they also expressed a sense of hopelessness about Colorado’s future.

“As a player every time I stepped on the field I expected to win” former All-American linebacker Chad Brown said then. “I’ve had to remove that expectation from my rooting interest in the Buffaloes. I’d be disappointed all the time if I held that mindset still.”

And that was before Colorado went 1-11 this season losing its last three games 55-17 54-7 and 63-21.

Reached Saturday Brown sounded a lot more optimistic.

“This attempt to go after Deion and get him has renewed my spirt as a former Buffalo that the folks in charge aren’t going to let this program just fade off into obscurity” he said.

Bill McCartney’s son Mike now a sports agent sent this message within minutes of the school’s official announcement: “I’m beyond happy!”

They’re happy because Coach Prime gives them hope. And there hasn’t been much of that to go around the last 20 years. Colorado has never been an easy place to build a successful football program. The state doesn’t produce enough talent. The community is transient. The fan base is loyal but not necessarily large. And the relationship between the university and the football program has not always been harmonious.

It had gotten to the point in recent years that fans wondered whether the administration was even willing to invest in the program. They were scarred when Michigan State swooped in and hired away Mel Tucker after just one season at Colorado by more than doubling his $2.4 million salary.

Colorado reportedly offered Sanders a $5 million a year with enough money to assemble a quality staff as well. And George said recently that the university is working to solve an academic issue that has made it difficult for the program to bring in transfers. Dorrell’s 2022 roster got decimated by portal exits and he did not manage to bring in nearly as many. Sanders would not be coming without assurance he’ll be able to recruit both high-schoolers and portal guys to the same extent as his competition.

“Colorado — which let’s face it was not going to win many recruiting battles a week ago — is going to be on the radar of almost any transfer or any uncommitted recruit because of him” said Klatt.

Sanders will be unlike any coach in FBS football. He was a celebrity long before he became a football coach and now he’s football coach who conducts himself like a celebrity. Which is probably why higher-profile programs than Colorado weren’t in hot pursuit of an ostensibly desirable coach.

But Sanders does not need to conduct himself like his commercial co-star Nick Saban. He’s got his own style and his players truly look up to him. In a video released late Saturday of the team meeting where he told his players he was leaving it’s easy to see how he can be such a powerful mentor to the 18- to 22-year-old young men he coaches.

“I love what he does transforming boys into men into competitors” said former Colorado All-American offensive lineman Ryan Miller. “He did great things at Jackson State and I’m excited to see if he can revive the program. He commands respect and I hope it translates to some wins.”

And yet he will have no shortage of skeptics. What if after all the initial hype he crashes and burns?

The more interesting question for Colorado: What happens if he doesn’t?

It’s hard to say what the program’s ceiling is in today’s sport because it’s spent so long hovering closer to the floor. Its lone recent moment in the sun was Mike MacIntyre’s 2016 team which rose up to win 10 games and a division title. But that was a senior-heavy team built via recruiting classes annually ranked 12th in the Pac-12. The Buffaloes slipped right back to 5-7 once they graduated.

We haven’t yet seen the possibilities with a coach like Sanders who may truly start bringing in elite talent. He’s expected to bring with him his son quarterback Shedeur Sanders the 2021 Jerry Rice Award winner (given to the top freshman in FCS). Additional touted transfers will likely follow. The cupboard in Boulder is too barren to pull a Lincoln Riley-esque overnight flip but it would not be surprising if he upgrades the roster in a hurry.

In parallel he’ll need to assemble an all-star staff. Luring top-shelf assistants to Colorado is not generally easy but Sanders may have the clout and the administrative support to pull it off.

And then there’s the competition. USC and UCLA are leaving the Pac-12 after next season. Oregon is the one remaining program that consistently recruits at a high level. Utah is the league bully. Washington is on the rise under first-year coach Kaelen DeBoer but is not yet swimming in talent. The Arizona and Bay Area schools are playing catch up.

Just getting Colorado back to a bowl game would be a highly appreciated feat right now but it feels like Sanders could accomplish so much more. He just led Jackson State to consecutive SWAC titles the program’s first since 2007.

And that’s why this is moment is so profoundly exciting for Colorado fans. It truly feels like anything could be possible.

Because just getting Sanders to come to Boulder feels like a miracle unto itself.

Although modern farming techniques have been instrumental in producing enough food to sustain the world’s growing population they have also polluted our airways contaminated the soil and compromised water quality incurring harmful effects on humans animals plants and the planet in general.

However it doesn’t have to be this way. Although it will take a seismic shift in how the agricultural industry operates at every stage of the supply chain from farm to fork it is possible to curb the contamination associated with the sector. Here are a number of the most important ways that agriculture can clean up its act and minimise the pollution it produces.

Organic farming

The use of chemical-based fertilisers and pesticides has been hugely important to maximising crop yields and fighting off competitors for our food. However they have also brought with them a number of other undesirable side-effects. A return to organic farming is better for the environment but produces significantly smaller yields and as such is not a feasible tactic alone.

Precision farming

Instead organic farming could be combined with precision farming which utilises data on moisture temperature humidity and a range of other parameters to guarantee that crops receive the exact amount of H2O and chemical product that they require – and not a drop more. This not only optimises the use of resources but also protects the land from oversaturation with nutrients and toxins.

Better land use

At present agriculture is responsible for the destruction of far too many natural habitats and the degradation of too many land resources. By favouring crop rotation over monoculture farming eschewing deforestation positioning reeds shrubs and other border plants to prevent agricultural run-off and planting cover crops to protect the ground after the season is complete farmers can better care for the Earth that sustains them.

More plants less animals

Ruminant animals like cows and sheep consume vast amounts of crops and water as well as expelling substantial volumes of greenhouse gases into the air. By cultivating the land more and rearing livestock less we can reduce the burden on the planet in both ways. Of course this will take a concerted effort from consumers too since supply only ever responds to demand but a more plant-focused diet would be beneficial for all.

Waste management

The waste generated by farms and other husbandry holdings is a significant contributor to agricultural pollution. If farmers can implement plans to properly manage the waste they produce this will cut down significantly on their environmental footprint. This means appropriate storage processing and disposal of manure and other waste products as well as recycling and reusing wherever possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29mb21hbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMjQwOTItZ3JlZW4taHlkcm9nZW4tc3VtbWl0LW9tYW4tY29tbWVuY2VzLXRvZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Green Hydrogen Summit Oman commences today,"MUSCAT: The second edition of the Green Hydrogen Summit Oman (GHSO) Conference & Exhibition opens on 5 December 2022 under the auspices of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals at Oman Convention and Exhibition Muscat.

Nigeria LNG Train 7 Project Host Communities in Orashi threaten to shut it down

The host communities of the Nigeria LNG Train 7 Project in the Orashi area of Rivers State under the aegis of the Ekpeye Oil and Gas Pipeline Host Communities (EOGPH) have threatened to shut down the project by moving against all multinationals in their area if the federal government and companies involved failed to duly consult them and address their grievances.

Chidi Idogini the National Chairman of EOGPHC said that it was wrong that the federal government and other parties involved in the Nigeria LNG Train 7 Project were only dealing with Bonny communities regretting that attention had not been given to Ekpeye people where the gas would be drilled.

“Ekpeye is as important or even more important in Nigeria LNG Train 7 Project as Bonny” Chidi Idogini

According to the National Chairman of EOGPHC Ekpeye is as important or even more important for the Nigeria LNG Train 7 Project as Bonny while the former has been impoverished for too long.

“Attention ought to have been given to Ekpeye communities where the raw material for the project will be gotten from than Bonny where only a terminal is being sited” said Mr. Idogini adding that the project implementation cannot begin without the involvement of the Ekpeye nation.

“The project is totally a business that has to do with Ekpeye and partly Ogba communities. The Nigeria LNG Train 7 Project team therefore has to come and discuss with us otherwise will not allow any company to come to Ekpeye land to undertake the drilling works” assured the National Chairman of EOGPHC.

Background

Nigeria LNG Train 7 project is an ongoing expansion of the Nigeria LNG Terminal at Bonny Island Nigeria which currently has a total of six operational LNG processing units four 84200m³ LNG storage tanks four 65000m³ refrigerated storage tanks and three 36000m³ condensate storage tanks.

In addition the terminal also has a common LNG processing fractionation plant a common condensate stabilization plant two LNG export jetties 23 dedicated LNG ships and a materials off-loading jetty and ten gas turbine generators with a combined capacity of more than 320MW.

Owned and operated by Nigeria LNG (NLNG) Company a joint venture between Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Shell Gas Total and Eni the terminal currently has the capacity to produce 22Mtpa of LNG and 5Mtpa of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and condensate per annum (Mtpa).

The Nigeria LNG Train 7 project will primarily add a seventh LNG processing unit with a production capacity of 4.2Mtpa and supporting infrastructure including an 84200m³ storage tank a 36000m³ condensate tank and three gas turbine generators at the terminal.

The project whose cost is approximately US$ 6.5bn will also include debottlenecking of the existing six trains that will increase the processing capacity by 3.4Mtpa and the construction of wells and pipelines to supply additional feed gas to the LNG facility.

Upon completion the Nigeria LNG Train 7 project will increase the Nigeria LNG Terminal production capacity by 35% from the current 22mtpa to 30mtpa.

Project timeline

2018

In July NLNG awarded Front End Engineering Design (FEED) contract for the train seven to two consortia of engineering companies namely B7 JV Consortium and SCD JV Consortium.

The B7 JV Consortium is made up of KBR TechnipFMC plc and Japan Gas Corporation (JGC) while the SCD JV Consortium includes Saipem S.p.A of Italy Chiyoda Corporation of Japan and Daewoo Engineering & Construction of South Korea.

In the same year Guaranty Trust Bank of Nigeria and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC) of Japan were appointed as the Financial Advisers for the Project.

2019

In March the NLNG and the Nigerian Content Development Monitoring Board (NCDMB) signed off an approved plan for Nigeria Content (NC) for NLNG’s Train 7 Project.

In September NLNG issued a Letter of Intent for the Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contract of the Project to SCD JV Consortium.

LNG Train 7 project

According to Tony Attah Managing Director for NLNG the company is making significant progress towards the realization of the extension project. “Intent as it connotes is a very clear statement that we are forging on with Train 7. The letter of intent is a bold statement that we have selected our preferred bidder for the contract. With Train 7 Nigeria will maintain its place in the global gas market and NLNG will continue to support the development of our domestic LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) consumption through our commitment of 350 million tonnes to the domestic market” Attah said.

The project will be owned and operated by Nigeria LNG a joint venture between Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) with 49% stake Shell Gas with 25.6% interest Total with 15% stake and Eni with 10.4% interest. Once the deal is approved by Nigerian authorities Daewoo E&C and its partners will be responsible for the construction of the LNG plant with an annual production capacity of 8 million tonnes and other associated facilities on Bonny Island Nigeria.

Upon completion the project will increase the Nigeria LNG facility’s total production capacity from 22 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). The project will increase the plant’s liquefaction capacity by 8 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) or 35% to reach 30 million barrels per day (Mmbpd).

In September last year NLNG issued a Letter of Intent for the EPC Contracts of the project to SCD JV Consortium. The Letter expresses the intention to award the main EPC Contract subject to the signing of the terms to the preferred bidder after a contracting process that has been transparent and in full compliance with all applicable laws and good industry practices.

NLNG took the Final Investment Decision (FID) on 27 December 2019 which was followed by the approval of the Nigerian Content Compliance Certificate (NCCC) and Approved Vendors Lists (AVLs) by Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) in April this year.

Present during the signing of the EPC contract the Group Managing Director of NNPC Mr. Mele Kyari expressed satisfaction to see that the contracts have been finally awarded and fully signed.

The Project is expected to create about 10000 new jobs during the construction stage and on completion help to further diversify the revenue portfolio of the Federal Government and increase its tax base.

Nigeria LNG Train 7 project officially inaugurated by Muhammadu Buhari​

President Muhammadu Buhari has officially inaugurated the Nigeria LNG Train 7 project to mark the start of the construction of a new liquefaction unit an 84200m³ storage tank a 36000m³ condensate tank and three gas turbine generators at the Bonny Island LNG facility.

“Today I have performed the groundbreaking ceremony for a very important project and a milestone in the country’s oil and gas sector. I have been passionately associated with this project for a long time since the formative years of the LNG project. As Minister of Petroleum Resources back in 1978 I kicked off Nigeria’s first foray in the LNG Business and we have not looked back ever since.“

“I am very delighted that we have reached yet another milestone today under my watch. We will continue to deliver on and enable transformational public and private sector projects of this nature to the people of this nation” said the West African country’s president.

Upon completion the project will increase the capacity of NLNG’s current six-Train plant by 35% from the extant 22 Million Tonnes Per Annum (mtpa) to 30mtpa.

Project Development

The Nigeria LNG Train 7 project is speared by Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) a joint venture between the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and international oil majors Royal Dutch Shell ENI and Total.

NLNG took the Final Investment Decision (FID) in December 2019 which was followed by the approval of the Nigerian Content Compliance Certificate (NCCC) and Approved Vendors Lists (AVLs) by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) in April last year.

In May 2020 NLNG awarded the Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contracts for its Train 7 Project to SCD JV Consortium comprising affiliates of Saipem Chiyoda and Daewoo a step that triggered the commencement of the Detail Design and Construction phase of the Project.

The American international corporation will also provide process technology and proprietary processes to the JV. Noteworthy Air Products has previously provided the MCHEs and process technology for the first six trains at the NLNG at Bonny Island with initial on-stream LNG production from the units beginning in 1999 for the first to 2007 for the sixth.

Proof of quality products and good customer service

Speaking on the appointment Dr. Samir J. Serhan the Chief Operating Officer at Air Products said that they are proud that the six heat exchangers the company built at the NLNG at Bonny Island continue operating and that the Nigeria LNG Train 7 will utilize two additional Air Products’ heat exchangers from Air Products.

“Every customer is an important one but returning customers reveal a lot about how you are operating as a business and how your technology is viewed at the marketplace. Air Products prides itself on the manufacture of quality products and delivery of excellent customer service” said Dr. Serhan.

Production of the MCHEs

The Allentown Pennsylvania headquartered company will manufacture the main cryogenic heat exchangers at its Port Manatee Florida manufacturing plant in the southeasternmost U.S. state.

The Port Manatee facility was opened in January 2014 and in October 2019 the company completed a 60% expansion of the facility in a bid to meet the needs of the growing LNG industry.",,,,,,

Total demand for short-term rentals in September was up 26.6% compared with the same period in 2019 according to vacation rental data platform AirDNA. And for some guests successfully booking an Airbnb means more than just paying the cost (plus any additional fees) — it means maintaining a good rating from hosts.

Like Uber and other peer-to-peer rental platforms the reviews on Airbnb go both ways. Guests review properties and hosts to inform future guests and hosts review guests to inform future hosts.

Having a poor or nonexistent rating as a guest can make it hard to book stays particularly on peak travel dates when hosts can be choosy about whom they accept.

“If somebody doesn’t have any reviews that’s kind of a red flag — especially if it’s a brand-new account” says Patrick Moltrup an Airbnb host in California’s Coachella Valley. He says brand-new accounts with no ratings are a concern because guests who get bad reviews tend to delete their accounts and open new ones.

“We require a review before we book you.”

Despite recent horror stories about hosts demanding that guests perform arduous tasks at checkout and reports of hosts getting fed up with unruly guests maintaining a good guest rating doesn’t require a lot of effort according to Moltrup. Being thoughtful about some basic rules can make the difference between a successful rental and a canceled (or rejected) booking.

How to find your Airbnb reviews

Just like reviews for the properties themselves the reviews you receive from hosts have two parts: a written review and a numeric rating on a 5-star scale.

Finding your reviews can be tricky since Airbnb hides them deep within the account menu. On the website or app navigate to the “Account” page then select “Go to profile” near the top.

There you’ll find any written reviews from previous hosts. Can you see your Airbnb rating? No. You won’t find the numeric rating itself as only hosts can see this rating when a guest tries to book a stay.

So unless you know a host who is willing to share it your guest rating will remain inaccessible.

How to maintain a good rating

Unlike hosts who go to great lengths to maintain their positive ratings guests don’t have to do much.

“You’ll almost always get a positive review from your Airbnb host if you do two things: Respect the house and respect the rules” Scott Lieberman a former Airbnb host and frequent guest said by email.

Each rental has its own house rules which can be found in the booking details. Hosts sometimes leave hard copies of the rules within the rental. These include prohibitions such as smoking and loud music as well as checkout procedures which can be as simple as locking the door when you leave and possibly running the dishwasher.

Of course accidents happen. Plates break. Walls get crayoned. But hosts suggest they rarely leave bad reviews for these issues so long as they’re accidental and guests communicate them as quickly as possible.

“If you break something that’s OK just tell us that you broke it” says Moltrup suggesting that failing to communicate clearly and consistently can affect a guest’s rating. “When we leave a review we’re asked: ‘Did they communicate well?’”

In the end hosts say it comes down to respect. And there’s a big difference between an accident and a clear breach of considerate behavior. Moltrup says he almost always leaves a positive review unless the guest leaves him no option.

“We had a guy who melted chocolate on the stove and then threw it on our driveway” he says.

What to do if you get a bad review as a guest

Sometimes communication goes south misunderstandings arise or a host simply has a bad day and leaves you a bad review. These situations can affect your rating and your ability to secure bookings for years to come.

Here are some steps to take if you find yourself with a bad Airbnb review:

Respond to the review to explain your experience. This will help future hosts understand the broader picture. It might also encourage the original host to modify or update their review. Striking a calm bridge-building tone can go a long way.

Message the host directly and explain. Especially in the case of misunderstanding this action can help clear the air.

Contest the review. If all else fails or you believe you’re being unfairly treated by the host you can try to dispute the review. Airbnb has clear guidelines for what can be disputed including reviews that are biased or irrelevant.

A single negative review might not have that much of an impact especially if it’s countered by many other good reviews. Just like savvy shoppers on Amazon many hosts look into the details of bad reviews to see how bad they really are.

“We read the reviews to see what the issues were” Moltrup says. “If they bring extra people to a property that’s no good. If you’re damaging stuff or you’re not communicating we look at that.”

The bottom line

Because they feel so personal reviews from Airbnb hosts can seem like a big deal. And they can jeopardize your ability to book future trips especially during busy travel dates. But maintaining a good rating is as simple as respecting the property and communicating effectively with the host.

Unlike rideshare drivers who sometimes seem to leave bad reviews for passengers who breathe the wrong way Airbnb hosts tend to be forgiving of minor issues.

And if the host asks you to trim the hedges before you leave feel free to consider Airbnb alternatives — or simply push back.

“You shouldn’t have to do unreasonable checkout tasks such as stripping the beds doing the laundry or vacuuming” the CEO of Airbnb Brian Chesky wrote this month on Twitter.

She still got fined $3750,"Up until three years ago Montrealer Ashley Werhun was occasionally renting out the condo she shares with her fiancé on Airbnb when they were out of town.

In 2019 the Quebec government toughened the rules for short-term rentals and Werhun decided at that point to stop renting her property. She hasn't rented it since.

But in 2021 after a Father's Day weekend visit from her father-in-law Revenu Québec fined Werhun $3750 for having a listing for an unregistered Airbnb.

She received notice of the fine a few months later in the mail. The letter from Revenu Québec said it appeared that she'd had a visitor on the Father's Day weekend and that inspectors had subsequently discovered her Airbnb listing online.

The letter also included photographs inspectors had taken of her residence without her knowledge a few weeks after her father-in-law's visit.

When Revenu Quebec notified Ashley Werhun of her fine they sent her a letter that included photos inspectors had taken of her property. (CBC News)

Werhun isn't clear on how Revenu Québec was made aware of her father-in-law's visit (she believes it's possible an unwitting neighbour may have made a complaint) but it was that visit that prompted Revenu Québec to follow up.

Even though her father wasn't a paying guest and she explained that to Revenu Québec she was still fined.

""It doesn't matter if you actually rented it it doesn't matter if you made zero dollars"" Werhun told CBC in an interview at the Montreal courthouse Monday.

Her story highlights the frustration of many Airbnb hosts who feel they've been unfairly targeted since Quebec toughened the rules.

Fines start at $3750

The rule change that has prompted such consternation came in 2019.

That's when Quebecers who rented out their homes on a short-term basis (under 31 days) were required to obtain a registration number through the province for a cost of $50.

That number has to be included on any advertising contract or website connected to the rental unit.

The province was slow to start enforcing the law but started to ramp up enforcement in 2021 after hiring more inspectors. Revenu Québec also stopped giving warnings instead proceeding straight to fines.

The fine for an individual who fails to correctly post their registration number is $3750 including administrative fees. If two people are listed as property owners each individual is fined that amount.

The change has been lucrative for Revenu Québec with just under $3 million in fines assessed in the first 10 months of this year alone.

Hosts with old listings still face fines

Where Werhun may have gone wrong was in how she changed the status of her Airbnb listing when she stopped renting.

She says she ""unlisted"" her online ad meaning it was removed from search results by Airbnb. No one could reserve it until she reactivated the listing. She said she blocked off dates for two years.

But Revenu Québec inspectors were still able to find traces of her listing online and if a listing appears without a registration number included a fine is automatically assessed. It doesn't matter if you're not actually renting.

Airbnb has several options for the status of its listings from snoozing to unlisting to deactivating to deleting an account. In July after receiving the fine Werhun permanently deactivated her account.

Airbnb refused to comment on Werhun's case because of privacy policies. A spokesperson told CBC in an email that Airbnb actively encourages hosts to be in compliance with existing regulations.

Werhun said Revenu Québec is clearly punishing people who never intended to break the law and never realized they were breaking the law.

""A lot of citizens are being fined for having old listings. So even if a listing was in 2005 or 2010 if they didn't fully confirm and delete all the data on the account that still lives somewhere on the internet unbeknownst to them"" Werhun said.

""If a citizen has a listing from 10 years ago that they weren't even aware of and they clearly have shown that they weren't trying to evade the law then that's not the person you should be looking for your revenue from"" she said.

Ombudsman says government message 'confusing'

Werhun isn't alone in her frustration. A Facebook group dedicated exclusively to complaints about Revenu Québec fines for short-term rentals has more than 300 members.

And in May the office of Quebec's ombudsman wrote a memorandum after receiving several complaints about fines that were perceived to be unfair.

The ombudsman found that the province should have done a better job explaining its new rules.

""The ombudsman has identified several discrepancies between the rules in effect and the information available discrepancies that could confuse citizens"" the report said.

The ombudsman gave the example of an online guide — and Quebec government ads that ran from 2013 to 2018 — that indicated that having a certificate for an Airbnb listing was mandatory.

Then a new online guide and a press release from the tourism minister's office was issued in 2018 and suggested that the certificate was optional if you were listing your primary residence.

The rules changed in 2019 but the ministry did not update its online guide until 2021 so some people who consulted the guide in good faith could have been led to believe that a certificate was optional — which was not the case.

The ombudsman also found that when people used online search engines to try to verify the rules they were often shunted toward the 2018 ministerial news release which also was no longer accurate.

And the ombudsman noted that as late as July 2021 Airbnb on its website was still saying the certificate was optional.

This map from independent watchdog group Inside Airbnb suggests that more than 95 per cent of Airbnb listings Montreal in late 2021 were unlicensed. (Inside Airbnb)

""In light of the problems identified the Quebec ombudsman wishes to underline the importance that required guides be made available quickly on the government website and that the ministry ensures that all obsolete information is removed"" the memorandum recommended.

A spokesperson for Quebec's Tourism Ministry Jean-Manuel Téotonio told CBC in an email the obsolete news release and erroneous information in the online guide have been removed.

Téotonio said the ministry's communication strategy when the law was changed included news releases social media postings and notes on government websites.

""Key industry partners and ministry staff who are in close contact with stakeholders in the tourist accommodation sector also acted as relays"" Téotonio said.

But the ombudsman's report suggested this is probably not enough.

""This information will be directed to those who already follow these organizations on social networks which is not necessarily the case for citizens who are thinking of offering their residence for rent"" the report said.

Why not a warning?

Werhun said given of this confusion and lack of clarity about the rules Revenu Québec should still be giving out warnings instead of instantly fining people.

""I think a warning would be great for them to say: 'Hey looks like you have an unlisted property. Do you have any intentions? There's a new law'"" Werhun said.

She noted in her case instead of a warning a few weeks after her father-in-law's visit Revenu Québec inspectors came to her home and trespassed on her property to take photos. Copies of these photos were sent to her when she was informed of the fine.

""They could have knocked on our door to say: 'Hey it looks like you have a visitor' and I would have said: 'No it's my father-in-law'"" Werhun said.

""That would have been a little bit more civil"" she said.

Mylène Gagnon a spokesperson for Revenu Québec responded to CBC in an email.

""Certain omissions or actions by a tourist accommodation establishment operator constitute offences liable to fines"" Gagnon said.

""Revenu Québec ensures compliance with tax rules and obligations by carrying out inspections in the tourism sector"" she said.

Online platforms and accountability

The ombudsman also suggested in his report that Revenu Québec was perhaps targeting the wrong people.

The ombudsman said that hosting platforms such as Airbnb should be part of the solution pointing to the law in France and many other jurisdictions where not just citizens but platforms themselves are fined if listings appear online without a registration number.

""Assigning all liability to the person who operates a tourist accommodation does not contribute to reducing the number of non-conformities generated by ignorance of the law"" the ombudsman's report said.

The ombudsman's recommendations are intended to reduce the number of non-compliant listings in particular those belonging to ""citizens acting in good faith but who are ill-informed"" the report concluded.

Neither the Tourism Ministry nor Revenu Québec would comment on this suggestion.

Despite feeling her fine was unfair Werhun agreed to pay it during her court appearance Monday.

""I thought taking time away from work to go to a trial for this and what that would do to the stress levels — It would be better just to pay it"" she said.

""You end up paying $20000 in lawyer fees. I can't afford that"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIxMjA0L2FpcmJuYi1oYXMtcGxhbi1maXgtY2xlYW5pbmctZmVlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb has a plan to fix cleaning fees,"Pretty much everyone hates Airbnb cleaning fees – those pesky charges tacked on to your vacation rental bill that supposedly cover the costs to get the place ready for the next visitors.

Travellers don’t like the expense and hosts don’t like charging them either.

Dennis Shirshikov an Airbnb host who owns a rental property in upstate New York says cleaning fees are the most common complaint he gets from customers.

“We are strongly considering cutting them off” he says.

And Shirshikov might get his way. Airbnb is set to roll out big changes that won’t end cleaning fees but could make them more transparent for customers and incentivise hosts to reduce or forgo them altogether.

Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.

Airbnb cleaning fees are a one-time charge pocketed by hosts to cover costs such as doing laundry or scrubbing toilets between guest stays. They’re separate from the base price and are in addition to service fees or charges for optional add-ons.

A June 2022 NerdWallet analysis of 1000 US Airbnb reservations with check-in dates in 2022 or 2023 found that the median cleaning fee per listing for a one-night stay was US$75.

But cleaning fees vary widely. An Airbnb spokesperson told NerdWallet that cleaning fees are on average less than 10 per cent of the total reservation cost at properties that charge them. Meanwhile NerdWallet’s analysis found that cleaning fees amounted to about 25 per cent of the total price paid. In fact almost 40 per cent of listings had cleaning fees from 20 per cent to 29.9 per cent of list price.

And on a few listings cleaning fees were higher than the nightly rate.

Besides the cost Airbnb cleaning fees can feel especially brutal simply given their presentation. Airbnb’s search page displays the nightly rate on most interfaces in big bold lettering masking the total price. So the total price presented in lightly coloured lettering can be easy to overlook.

To add to the confusion nightly rates often don’t correlate with total price anyway. One listing with a US$40 nightly rate could total US$90 because of a US$40 cleaning fee and US$10 service fee. Another listing with a US$60 nightly rate could turn out cheaper – US$73 total – if it has a US$13 service fee and no cleaning fee. A traveller with a US$50 budget might be seduced by the US$40 listing only to owe more than if they had booked the US$60 listing.

But that’s set to change this month December when Airbnb plans to roll out a toggle so travellers can opt for search results to display total price including all fees . Users who don’t toggle the total price display will still see nightly rates only.

The company in November 2022 also adjusted its search algorithm to rank listings by the best total price rather than simply accounting for the nightly rate which may sway hosts to lower or remove cleaning fees.

A minority of listings don’t charge cleaning fees. Airbnb says 45 per cent of listings worldwide don’t charge those fees. Yet only 15 per cent of the available listings in NerdWallet’s analysis didn’t have a cleaning fee. The disparity is partly because NerdWallet looked at only US listings while Airbnb’s number is based on listings worldwide where the fees are less common.

Shirshikov says he’d prefer to list a final price that includes the cleaning fee for two reasons. First he suspects guest satisfaction would increase and second he thinks guests would leave the place cleaner.

Airbnb has warned hosts that cleaning fees can backfire by creating unrealistic expectations of how much guests will offer to help at checkout.

“With a higher (cleaning) fee guests may expect to just walk away from your space at checkout as they would a hotel room” said Airbnb in a memo posted to its website before the cleaning changes kicked in.

That’s exactly what Shirshikov has experienced.

“If they pay a cleaning fee they sometimes leave the place looking like it’s been lived in and uncleaned for months” he says adding that he has returned to find food all over the floor and drinks spilled on the beds.

Why the fees persist

For hosts who clean the rentals themselves the money might cover the cost of cleaning supplies. Often that money is simply passed on to professional housekeeping services who handle the cleaning.

Sébastien Long  the founder and CEO of Texas-based short-term rental company Lodgeur says he believes the average cleaning fee of US$75 is quite low.

Considering staff wages supplies and replacement items Long says he estimates it costs roughly US$22 to turn over a hotel room. If Airbnb hosts outsource the work Long estimates it could cost US$175 to clean a two-bedroom apartment including US$100 for the cleaning company US$50 for laundry services and US$25 for supplies such as coffee or mini toiletry bottles.

The cleaning costs for Airbnb hosts are often higher than those for hotels because they likely can’t take advantage of economies of scale. For example hotels have commercial-size laundry machines. Plus listings are typically spread out geographically so there’s the inefficiency of travelling miles between properties. And short-term rentals typically are much larger and have more space to clean – such as kitchens – than hotel rooms.

But other hosts use the fees simply as a way to squeeze more money out of travellers clearly overcharging for cleaning fees which is a practice Airbnb warns against.

“Aim to use the cleaning fee to cover the expense of cleaning – not to make additional money” according to a 2021 memo from Airbnb to hosts.

And then there are the hosts who charge cleaning fees and still ask guests to clean up after themselves. That too will likely end soon. Along with more transparent cleaning fees Airbnb said it also plans to require hosts to post the cleaning requirements on the listing before guests book. Guests will also be able to leave feedback on the checkout process.

Airbnb also clarified that checkout requests should be reasonable. At your next Airbnb stay if the host is amenable to the changes you might not have to vacuum or strip the beds. The only things you’ll have to do are turn off the lights throw away the trash and lock the door.

For now though Shirshikov says he’s sticking with charging cleaning fees because he’s uncertain whether users will turn on the toggle.

“I’d want to see how many people actively turn on the full price display” he says. “Unless guests use it it won’t mean much for how we do pricing.”

The eight and one additional girl had been taken from the homes of Samuel Bateman — the leader of a small offshoot of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — and placed in the group homes under the custody of the Arizona Department of Child Safety in September.

Last Sunday however the eight girls who range in age from 11 to 16 went missing from the homes outside Phoenix the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

They were found four days later at an Airbnb in Spokane Washington with a Bateman follower named Moretta Rose Johnson 19 who has since been accused of kidnapping according to a federal complaint obtained by the paper. Johnson reportedly married Bateman when she was underage according to KXLY.

A 24-year-old woman was also arrested in Colorado City Arizona in relation to the missing girls. She was booked into the Mohave County jail on suspicion of kidnapping obstructing a criminal investigation resisting arrest and tampering with a witness the outlet reported.

FBI agents had traced a credit card linked to a business of one of Bateman’s followers to the reservation on the Airbnb rental site the court documents state.

The girls were considered runaways according to the Tribune.

All nine children and teens were removed from Bateman’s homes on Sept. 14 when the FBI searched his properties looking for evidence that he had underage wives or engaged in sex acts with minors according to a FBI affidavit.

Bateman 46 has been accused of wedding more than 20 women most under the age of 15 — reportedly including his own daughter.

Bateman allegedly made sexual advances toward his own daughter first bribing her with two bags of Doritos and $50 and saying “if his feelings were right he would do what a boy does to make [her] have a baby” KXYLY reported.

While he hasn’t been charged with sexual abuse or other related crimes the affidavit claims the FBI has probable cause to believe he and others transported minors between Arizona Utah Nevada and Nebraska to engage in illicit sexual conduct between May 2020 and November 2021.

Bateman has remained jailed since late August when authorities found three young girls between the ages of 11 and 14 locked inside a cargo trailer he was towing near Flagstaff."

To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see 5 biggest mining companies in the world.

The mining industry is easily one of the most important sectors in the global economy and was worth around $1.84 trillion in 2021 while growing to $2.06 trillion in 2022. This is a stunning increase at a CAGR of 12% and the industry is expected to continue growing at an even more exceptional CAGR of 12.9% and will cross $3.36 trillion by 2026.

2022 has been a bumper year for the mining industry as a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Since these two countries are major producers of several metals such as copper iron and nickel while also being involved in other raw materials extraction such as of palladium neon and platinum. When the war started the supply of these metals was affected which led to an increase in prices. Prices also soared amid the West's sanctions on Russia. For example palladium was being traded at $2700 in February 2022 which showed an 80% increase in prices in a period of just two months.

(WMTV) - The Madison College community spent their Saturday celebrating the Hmong New Year!

The technical college hosted a free event at their Traux Campus where the public could watch cultural dance buy from Hmong-owned vendors and spend time together as a community.

Community engagement coordinator Masaya Xiong said there are many Hmong New Year celebrations around the area each one a bit different.

“There are certain traditions that do happen. New Years is just not a big celebration there are families that do their own type of New Years they have clan based New Year’s too and all those look very different depending on who runs them” Xiong said.

Xiong said what makes their celebration unique is their focus on educating the community.

“What makes us a little bit different is we get a chance to really help educate our community about our textile our dance movements our vendors right? And so we’re going to have some of that learning component that’s going to go into the performances” Xiong said.

Thousands gathered at the Alliant Energy Center in November for Madison’s annual Hmong New Year celebration.

A row of ornate homes in the Capitol Avenue historic district represent one of the first affluent neighborhoods to conceptualize in early Jefferson City.

Historian Gary Kremer wrote in ""Exploring Historic Jefferson City"" that this pocket of suburbia was one of the first to be directly connected to the city's center.

Many prominent political or business elites took residence there and as it is often recalled today grew wealthy by profiting from prison labor at the state penitentiary located across the street.

In 2005 the Capitol Avenue neighborhood was added to the National Register of Historic Places officially becoming a historic district.

The district is bounded by 400-700 blocks of Capitol Avenue the 100-200 blocks of Jefferson Lafayette and Marshall streets the 400 and 700 blocks of East High Street and the 200 block of Cherry Street.

Homes on Capitol Avenue built sometime between 1830-1947 bear archaic features that present a wide variety of architectural styles many the National Register recognizes as: Italianate Queen Anne Classical Colonial Gothic and Spanish Revival style buildings.

According to the National Register when the application was accepted there were 107 contributing structures and 12 non-contributing structures in the district. Some have been demolished due to abatement procedures from dangerous conditions.

Today any passerby would notice sheets of plywood boarding windows on about a dozen of Capitol Avenue homes in the district boards that also state ""No trespassing."" One might sense historical pertinence glancing upon the exterior facades for they don't look like today's typical housing stock. One might also recognize many of these homes show signs of degradation levels of cracking and a little more damage than basic wear-and-tear conditions.

Eleven have been long vacated and declared too dangerous to inhabit a result that triggered the city's comprehensive development plan -- approved by the City Council -- for how to address Capitol Avenue blight.

City officials and local preservationists hope the structural antiquity of the historic homes may be spared through private redevelopment. And a process for seeking people interested in placing future redevelopment bids on eight of the properties is open now until Dec. 13.

The city is also accepting full redevelopment proposals for three properties it owns until Dec. 22. The city denoted certain criteria must be submitted in the proposal to qualify. The 10-elected council members will have the final approval on accepting bids once (and if) they are received.

The city hired consultants from Allstate to visually assess the interior and exterior conditions for each of the properties. Many expressed desire to see inside the structures before placing bids however the city noted the danger in entering any of premises and instead hired consultants to draft reports including photos and estimations for repair costs.

The eight homes involved in the ""call for interested parties"" process are not owned by the city though the redevelopment plan regards a future effort to obtain ownership through an eminent domain lawsuit.

Cost estimates authored by consultants were determined using prices for builders' grade materials and only include repairs making homes livable.

Estimates do not factor costs for restoring buildings in any historical capacity.

Damages observed by Allstate consultants are summarized below and consultants have said more damage may be prevalent than what is otherwise noted in their reports.

Remember the Alamo? The Texas Longhorns know it quite well.

The No. 20 Longhorns will return to San Antonio to face No. 12 Washington in the Valero Alamo Bowl on Dec. 29. Texas will be playing in the Alamodome for the third time in four years.

With Kansas State winning the Big 12 title over No. 3 TCU the Wildcats will represent the Big 12 in the Allstate Sugar Bowl against No. 5 Alabama. The Horned Frogs (12-1 9-0 Big 12) did enough during their undefeated regular season run to make the 2022 College Football Playoff along with No. 1 Georgia No. 2 Michigan and No. 4 Ohio State.

The Alamo Bowl usually plays host to the second-ranked teams in both the Big 12 and Pac-12. However with both schools having multiple representatives in the New Years Six bowl cycle the Longhorns (8-4 6-3 Big 12) and Huskies (10-2 7-2 Pac-12) will take the place of both as the third-ranked teams in the conference.

Texas produced better results in Year 2 of the Steve Sarkisian era but still showed several similarities from a season ago. Despite picking up wins over Oklahoma in the Red River Showdown and Kansas State on the road the Longhorns blew a pair of second-half leads to Texas Tech and Oklahoma State respectively ultimately factoring into their third-place finish.

Washington over exceeded expectations under first-year coach Kalen DeBoer. Quarterback Michael Penix Jr. who played at Indiana while DeBoer served as the Hoosiers offensive coordinator led the nation in passing yards (4354) and finished with 34 touchdowns against three interceptions.

The Huskies last played in the Alamo Bowl when Sarkisian served as head coach losing to Bayor 66-57. That season Washington went toe-to-toe win Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III.

Even prior to recent memory the Longhorns are far from strangers playing in the Alamo Bowl. Since its inaugural game in 1993 Texas has been a record-leading six times. The Longhorns have gone five times since 2006 including this upcoming matchup.

The Longhorns and Huskies have met four times on the gridiron since 1974. Texas currently holds an all-time 3-1 record over Washington including winning its last matchup in the Holiday Bowl back in 2001.

Sarkisian said he did not know which players would opt out of the bowl game following the Longhorns' 38-27 season finale win over Baylor. It's expected that running back Bijan Robinson along with several seniors will not participate and begin preparing for the 2023 NFL Draft.

You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

In June 2022 South Korean tech giant Naver Corporation opened a new office building — and a fleet of robots are now navigating its halls alongside the human employees. The building is a sandbox for trying out the tech that’s being developed there as well as teaching robots how to work around humans.

The background

Naver operates South Korea’s most popular search engine earning it the nickname of the “Korean Google” but “Korean Alphabet” might be more apt (though admittedly a bit more confusing).

Like Google’s parent company Alphabet Naver is involved in seemingly everything tech-related including AI robotics healthcare self-driving cars and the metaverse and many of the conglomerate’s most futuristic projects are spearheaded by its R&D subsidiary Naver Labs.

In 2016 Naver announced plans to construct a new headquarters in Bundang South Korea but rather than building a typical high-rise it decided to make the entire facility dubbed “1784” into a testbed for Naver Labs’ tech creating what it calls the “world’s first robot-friendly building.”

“At 1784 we’ll be experiencing and testing the future technologies we’re developing before presenting them to the world” SangChul Kang head of Naver Labs’ Project and Platform Group said in April 2022.

The building

The most obvious tech testing going on at 1784 involves Naver Lab’s self-driving service robot Rookie which is about 3 feet tall and looks a bit like a water dispenser minus the jug. At 1784 dozens of these bots fill the role of “gofer” ferrying things around the building.

An employee can place an online order at the in-house Starbucks for example and the barista will load the drink into a Rookie’s storage compartment. The bot will then drive itself to the thirsty worker’s location and use facial recognition tech to identify who it’s supposed to give it to.

Naver Labs also gave the robots animated “eyes” to help workers anticipate their movements and designed them to be as unobtrusive as possible while navigating the building.

“Socioculturally speaking we made our robots have manners” said a member of Naver Labs’ human-robot interaction team. “We all have our personal space and feel discomfort when other people come too close. Our robots were designed to successfully avoid people in a way that does not invade this personal space.”

For Naver ensuring Rookies could go everywhere they needed to on a single floor in 1784 wasn’t a problem — by adhering to standards for wheelchair accessibility the company didn’t need to worry about the bot being blocked by narrow hallways or individual steps.

1784 has 36 floors though so Naver designed the robot to be able to use elevators alongside employees. It even worked out that the best place for the robot to “stand” was in the front corner opposite the floor buttons — elevator riders got uncomfortable when the bot stood behind them.

To ensure the robot could continue operating at times when elevators were crowded such as around lunch hour Naver even built a robot-only elevator system called the “Roboport” inside 1784.

Rather than trying to make each Rookie “smart” Naver Labs designed the bots to transmit data from their cameras and sensors to ARC a cloud-based system that acts as a brain for all of the robots in the fleet.

ARC is able to cross reference images from a Rookie’s camera with a “digital twin” of the building’s interior identifying the robot’s location in the building within 6 inches. It can then tell it the most efficient route to take to its destination and because this communication happens over a local 5G network there’s hardly any lag.

In addition to minimizing each individual robot’s processing power needs using a central “brain” also makes it easier for Naver Labs to manage its robot fleet which is expected to number 100 by the end of 2022.

“In such a large building we do believe in the need for a central control system for harmonious and smart control for 100 robots to move — we have to manage that properly” Sangok Seok CEO of Naver Labs told Fast Company.

Beyond the bots

The Rookie robots are just one part of what makes 1784 forward-looking. There’s also a two-armed robot called “Ambidex” whose job it is to clean the Rookies and the building also houses a “startup factory” an AI research center and a dedicated space for testing mobile tech on more than 200 devices.

Employees also have access to a healthcare clinic that Naver Labs is using to develop tech for the medical industry including an AI that listens to conversations between patients and doctors and extracts relevant data for medical records.

That sort of AI technology — and the Rookies’ facial recognition tech — makes 1784 sound a bit “1984” but Naver says it’s in compliance with South Korea’s data privacy and surveillance laws.

Naver also appears to be taking steps to balance its need for data with employee’s comfort.

According to a report by the New York Times Rookie relies primarily on its front-facing camera for navigation and that camera is positioned to film from employees’ waists down — if the bot is knocked over or its camera angle changes it issues a warning that a face might be filmed.

It’s not clear if the warning is issued if the person is naturally in the robot’s line of sight because they’re sitting for example. The bot will use images from other cameras if ARC can’t place it using the front-facing one too meaning it’s not clear if employees always know when they’re being filmed.

Still Naver’s goal is to eventually sell products developed at 1784 to customers and that might happen sooner rather than later — on November 29 it gave Saudi Arabian officials a tour of 1784 in the hopes of being asked to help build the nation’s in-development smart city NEOM.

By using its own headquarters as a testbed for this tech Naver is figuring out how to make people more comfortable with these products before they’re out in the world whether it’s by giving robots “eyes” or teaching them the least-creepy place to stand in an elevator.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the plight of the world and go directly to 5 Biggest Issues in the World and The Companies Working on Solving Them.

The world is currently going through several crises most of which are exacerbating each other. On November 15 2022 the world population hit 8 billion people. All other things constant it is expected to reach 10 billion people in 2050 according to UN forecasts.

Growing population means more resource consumption. As economic growth around the world leads to rising living standards consumption is expected to skyrocket. The UN International Resources Panel estimates that resource-use per person in 2050 will be 75% higher than it is today.

Even in the present day humanity is consuming resources 1.8 times faster than Earth’s biocapacity can regenerate according to Overshoot Today. The ecological footprint of an average American is 8.1 Global Hectares (gha) per person while Earth’s biocapacity is only 1.6 gha per person. If everyone consumed like the average American we would need 5 Earths.

A landmark MIT study done in 1972 accounted for interacting variables such as natural resources population growth rate food production/supply industrial output and pollution in a system-dynamics computer model and showed that our default business-as-usual trajectory leads to overshoot and global system collapse somewhere in the mid-21st century. The data from 38 years since the study confirmed its findings in another study done in 2020.

These are stark problems and have created demand for technological solutions which is where the free market comes in to respond. Many established as well as startup companies are attempting to solve these problems.

For instance climate change has resulted in the emergence of the carbon-capture industry (because we’re also destroying the natural carbon sinks forests) made up of companies attempting to develop efficient and scalable carbon-capture technologies. Notable among these are Aker Carbon Capture ASA (OSLO:ACC.OL) and Carbfix. While some companies are actively trying to solve climate change others like Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are doing so passively by adopting climate-friendly policies.

Now that we understand the background let’s move on to the list of 10 biggest issues in the world and the companies working on solving them.

Our Methodology

For our list of the 10 biggest issues in the world and the companies working on solving them we’ve consulted the UN’s Global-Issues list and selected the ones that are the most globally consequential. For companies trying to solve them we’ve used data from various forward-focused media organizations like The Verge Tech Crunch Gizmodo and Mashable.

10. Gender Equality

Gender disparity is still among the biggest issues in the world in 21st century especially in the global south. Most of it results from the gender roles assigned to both biological sexes where women get the worse end of the bargain.

According to data from UNICEF girls aged 10-14 are twice as likely to spend an average of 21 hours per week on household tasks than boys of the same age worldwide.

The world is also missing out on the full potential of one-half of its population. The ILO report on gender gap in employment shows women represent only 47% of the workforce around the world while men make up 72% of it as of 2022.

Many large market-cap companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are taking the initiative in gender inclusion and hiring more and more women for gender equity.

An AI startup called Pipeline has also been one of the companies working on solving the issue. It has been making headlines for developing algorithms that help HR departments avoid hiring patterns which are systematically biased against intersectional female gender.

9. Misinformation

Misinformation is one of the most pressing problems of the 21st century. It is having a corrosive effect on democracies and institutional trust not only in the developing world but in the developed world as well and leading to a rise in populism.

Misinformation is also central to the present-day disdain for expertise. Its most recent example in the US was the response to the pandemic from some sections of the society.

A significant number of people believed that pandemic lockdowns and vaccination were an excuse for “globalists” to take control of the society and microchip people for surveillance. A survey conducted by YouGov in collaboration with The Economist showed that one in five Americans held this belief.

Misinformation spreads much faster through digital and social media platforms which is why many digital technology companies like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ByteDance and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have introduced various methods to detect and remove misinformation from their products’ platforms.

8. Wealth Inequality

Wealth inequality between countries and between individuals within countries are among the biggest issues in the world. In terms of wealth inequality between individuals the richest global 1% own 46% of the global wealth according to Inequality.org.

For perspective in 2018 it only took 26 billionaires to hold as much wealth as the bottom 50% of the entire world. High income inequality has been found to be linked with increased risk of economic instability and financial crises. Further in developed nations life expectancy and levels of physical health are often lower due to income inequality.

Many startups have started to emerge that are working on solving the problem. One such startup is Pioneer. Its solution to wealth inequality is entrepreneurship. It hosts a sizable online competition every month where people present their projects like startups books and research projects.

These projects can be digitally voted for by other members adding points for advancement. Projects with highest points are evaluated at the end of the month and a dozen or so are selected for funding backed by Marc Andreessen.

7. Health

Global health is in crisis especially in the developing world due to lack of proper medical resources hygiene and socio-political issues. Apart from these two factors many diseases have been wreaking havoc without a cure. Cancer for instance takes 1 out of 6 lives in the world every year according to Webmd.com.

In parts of the world like Africa the threat of another viral outbreak is ever present. The two recent outbreaks of Ebola Virus and Zika Virus occurred in 2013 and 2015 respectively contributing to a 63% increase in zoonotic diseases on the continent from 2012-2022 according to WHO.

The Covid-19 outbreak which has claimed nearly 7 million lives as of 2022 also showed the world how unprepared it is to deal with outbreaks of airborne viruses despite their statistical inevitability.

Many companies are working to tackle the rising threat of global health crises. These include Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is known for developing Ervebo the vaccine for Ebola Virus that contained its spread. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is known for its contribution to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine the first vaccine to roll out for Covid-19.

6. Poverty

Extreme poverty is one of the biggest humanitarian issues in the world. According to World Vision around 9.2% of the global population lives in extreme poverty and make less than $1.90 a day.

A number of startup companies have emerged as of late to alleviate suffering caused by poverty. One such startup is Unhoused.org. It is a London-based retailer that sells items like clothes dental kits and other consumer products. For every product it sells it donates the same to an organization helping the homeless community.

Another startup known as Wagestream lets the workers of companies which are subscribed to it tap into their incomes at any time of the month so they can accommodate their ongoing needs. The company has received significant investment from people like Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have also significantly contributed to tackling extreme poverty. Google has contributed $50 million to the global education project and $50 million to the economic opportunity initiative in the battle against extreme poverty.

Family owned businesses are businesses are where the the founder or the family of the founder owns a substantial share of the company and can influence important decisions especially as it relates to the company's Chairman and CEO positions.

In some ways family owned businesses have their advantages. Because they have substantial influence family owned businesses can often make important decisions faster than a non-family CEO given there is less resistance. Family owned businesses can also plan more for the long term rather than focusing on short term metrics if the owner chooses to do so.

By definition many tech startups are family owned given that their founders own a substantial share of the company and exercise a lot of influence. With the growth in the tech industry over the past few decades some family owned companies have grown substantially and many of the founders rank among the world's richest people. Perhaps the best example of this would be billionaire Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) who founded the company before handing off control to current CEO Andy Jassy. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) did not make much profits for many years to gain more market share under Bezos.

Some of the leading companies in emerging markets are also family owned. In India billionaire Gautam Adani runs Adani Group while billionaire Mukesh Ambani continues to steer the giant company that is Reliance Industries.

It should be said that being able to make decisions faster and focusing more on the long term can send stocks lower too. Because billionaire Mark Zuckerberg has the majority voting control of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) he has been able to invest tens of billions into the metaverse which the market has not liked in the near term and is one reason why the stock is lower.

In terms of the world's richest people 2022 has been a challenging year as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times so far. With higher rates the broader market has declined. Nevertheless the richest people in the world who own publicly traded companies still rank among the world's wealthiest.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the plight of the world and go directly to 5 Biggest Issues in the World and The Companies Working on Solving Them.

The world is currently going through several crises most of which are exacerbating each other. On November 15 2022 the world population hit 8 billion people. All other things constant it is expected to reach 10 billion people in 2050 according to UN forecasts.

Growing population means more resource consumption. As economic growth around the world leads to rising living standards consumption is expected to skyrocket. The UN International Resources Panel estimates that resource-use per person in 2050 will be 75% higher than it is today.

Even in the present day humanity is consuming resources 1.8 times faster than Earth’s biocapacity can regenerate according to Overshoot Today. The ecological footprint of an average American is 8.1 Global Hectares (gha) per person while Earth’s biocapacity is only 1.6 gha per person. If everyone consumed like the average American we would need 5 Earths.

A landmark MIT study done in 1972 accounted for interacting variables such as natural resources population growth rate food production/supply industrial output and pollution in a system-dynamics computer model and showed that our default business-as-usual trajectory leads to overshoot and global system collapse somewhere in the mid-21st century. The data from 38 years since the study confirmed its findings in another study done in 2020.

These are stark problems and have created demand for technological solutions which is where the free market comes in to respond. Many established as well as startup companies are attempting to solve these problems.

For instance climate change has resulted in the emergence of the carbon-capture industry (because we’re also destroying the natural carbon sinks forests) made up of companies attempting to develop efficient and scalable carbon-capture technologies. Notable among these are Aker Carbon Capture ASA (OSLO:ACC.OL) and Carbfix. While some companies are actively trying to solve climate change others like Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are doing so passively by adopting climate-friendly policies.

Now that we understand the background let’s move on to the list of 10 biggest issues in the world and the companies working on solving them.

Our Methodology

For our list of the 10 biggest issues in the world and the companies working on solving them we’ve consulted the UN’s Global-Issues list and selected the ones that are the most globally consequential. For companies trying to solve them we’ve used data from various forward-focused media organizations like The Verge Tech Crunch Gizmodo and Mashable.

10. Gender Equality

Gender disparity is still among the biggest issues in the world in 21st century especially in the global south. Most of it results from the gender roles assigned to both biological sexes where women get the worse end of the bargain.

According to data from UNICEF girls aged 10-14 are twice as likely to spend an average of 21 hours per week on household tasks than boys of the same age worldwide.

The world is also missing out on the full potential of one-half of its population. The ILO report on gender gap in employment shows women represent only 47% of the workforce around the world while men make up 72% of it as of 2022.

Many large market-cap companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are taking the initiative in gender inclusion and hiring more and more women for gender equity.

An AI startup called Pipeline has also been one of the companies working on solving the issue. It has been making headlines for developing algorithms that help HR departments avoid hiring patterns which are systematically biased against intersectional female gender.

9. Misinformation

Misinformation is one of the most pressing problems of the 21st century. It is having a corrosive effect on democracies and institutional trust not only in the developing world but in the developed world as well and leading to a rise in populism.

Misinformation is also central to the present-day disdain for expertise. Its most recent example in the US was the response to the pandemic from some sections of the society.

A significant number of people believed that pandemic lockdowns and vaccination were an excuse for “globalists” to take control of the society and microchip people for surveillance. A survey conducted by YouGov in collaboration with The Economist showed that one in five Americans held this belief.

Misinformation spreads much faster through digital and social media platforms which is why many digital technology companies like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ByteDance and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have introduced various methods to detect and remove misinformation from their products’ platforms.

8. Wealth Inequality

Wealth inequality between countries and between individuals within countries are among the biggest issues in the world. In terms of wealth inequality between individuals the richest global 1% own 46% of the global wealth according to Inequality.org.

For perspective in 2018 it only took 26 billionaires to hold as much wealth as the bottom 50% of the entire world. High income inequality has been found to be linked with increased risk of economic instability and financial crises. Further in developed nations life expectancy and levels of physical health are often lower due to income inequality.

Many startups have started to emerge that are working on solving the problem. One such startup is Pioneer. Its solution to wealth inequality is entrepreneurship. It hosts a sizable online competition every month where people present their projects like startups books and research projects.

These projects can be digitally voted for by other members adding points for advancement. Projects with highest points are evaluated at the end of the month and a dozen or so are selected for funding backed by Marc Andreessen.

7. Health

Global health is in crisis especially in the developing world due to lack of proper medical resources hygiene and socio-political issues. Apart from these two factors many diseases have been wreaking havoc without a cure. Cancer for instance takes 1 out of 6 lives in the world every year according to Webmd.com.

In parts of the world like Africa the threat of another viral outbreak is ever present. The two recent outbreaks of Ebola Virus and Zika Virus occurred in 2013 and 2015 respectively contributing to a 63% increase in zoonotic diseases on the continent from 2012-2022 according to WHO.

The Covid-19 outbreak which has claimed nearly 7 million lives as of 2022 also showed the world how unprepared it is to deal with outbreaks of airborne viruses despite their statistical inevitability.

Many companies are working to tackle the rising threat of global health crises. These include Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is known for developing Ervebo the vaccine for Ebola Virus that contained its spread. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is known for its contribution to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine the first vaccine to roll out for Covid-19.

6. Poverty

Extreme poverty is one of the biggest humanitarian issues in the world. According to World Vision around 9.2% of the global population lives in extreme poverty and make less than $1.90 a day.

A number of startup companies have emerged as of late to alleviate suffering caused by poverty. One such startup is Unhoused.org. It is a London-based retailer that sells items like clothes dental kits and other consumer products. For every product it sells it donates the same to an organization helping the homeless community.

Another startup known as Wagestream lets the workers of companies which are subscribed to it tap into their incomes at any time of the month so they can accommodate their ongoing needs. The company has received significant investment from people like Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have also significantly contributed to tackling extreme poverty. Google has contributed $50 million to the global education project and $50 million to the economic opportunity initiative in the battle against extreme poverty.

For as long as Trevin Peterson can remember he has wanted to be an entrepreneur.

He has tried just about anything to build a business. When he was 12 years old he made flyers and handed them out in his neighborhood offering services like lawn mowing poop cleaning and garbage disposal for $5 to $20 per request he told Insider. His early entrepreneurial attempt added about $40 a week to his pocket.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

College was another path he tried. He began in 2016 by attending Utah Valley University where he received an associate's degree in arts but dropped out before receiving his bachelor's degree. He didn't feel like he was learning anything useful or new and so he felt that college wasn't worth the cost.

One assignment really hit home for him. It was a task to put together a business plan which Peterson not only completed but executed online — an additional step that wasn't asked for. It was an ecommerce business on Shopify selling iPhone adapters and chargers and it was his first introduction to selling things online.

Peterson annoyingly received a ""C"" for the assignment. It also didn't escape him that his professor was formerly a business owner whose venture had failed. ""And I was like 'okay well I can't really learn from somebody that's failed a business this doesn't make any sense"" Peterson said.

The ecommerce store wasn't wildly successful but he managed to sell about $500 worth of products he said.

He also learned a lesson: It's hard to get people to buy things online.

Tried tested and failed attempts

While in college he tried a clothing popup shop where he bought wholesale clothes from a boutique and then hosted events at his house to sell them. He used a $1500 gift from his mother-in-law to purchase the initial inventory. It wasn't a complete failure: Peterson and his wife made a little bit of money but nothing significant enough to live off of he said.

The couple then attempted to nail down brand deals by growing an Instagram page for their dog. The account reached about 12000 followers when some deals began to trickle in from pet brands. However it was mostly in the form of free products and at times a few hundred dollars a month which also couldn't pay the bills.

He also tried selling call-center software for six months but didn't make a single sale.

""The best part is I had no idea what I was selling. I was hired to just cold call cold email and I was basically an appointment setter"" Peterson said of the experience.

Instead of continuing to spend his time and money in college in 2017 he decided to work for his dad who owned a construction company. His role was that of a superintendent project manager who oversaw subcontractors for various projects. It was a job he kept for over a year. In the interim Peterson also tried additional side hustles like selling a sports app for a network marketing company which didn't work out because the company went out of business.

Finding fulfillment in Amazon

In November 2017 Peterson heard about Fulfillment by Amazon from a seller friend. He didn't know that anyone could sell on Amazon and became interested in the idea. So Peterson began doing his research and within a few weeks he was ready to launch his first product: A seatbelt gap filler. It was an item that was placed between the center console and the seat to prevent things from falling. The initial idea came from a company that was featured on Shark Tank but he didn't know that.

Trevin Peterson

He was able to find the product on Alibaba the Chinese ecommerce company that provides wholesale products. He said he ordered 100 units of the gap filler for $400. To his surprise the product did well and he sold 50 units within a few days — until he received a cease and desist letter from the patent holder of the product.

""I didn't know I was infringing on anyone's patent and so I basically closed down that product"" Peterson said.

Related stories

He created a removal order so that Amazon's warehouse would dispose of the remainder of the units.

He realized that the hardest part of the process was figuring out what to sell. So he began trying his luck with different products. Next Peterson launched a car phone mount. He spent $500 on inventory and a few hundred dollars to advertise it and sold nothing. Altogether he recalls losing about $900 on that idea.

""I was like 'oh everyone loves this'. But little did I know the competition on Amazon for this particular product was super super high and I lost a bunch of money on that"" Peterson said.

The biggest lesson he learned from that experience was that you don't want to sell a product that has a lot of competition. This means other Amazon sellers have already amassed thousands of good reviews for the same product.

The next product he tried was a fidget pen which helps with ADHD. Again it began to do well until Amazon banned selling the product without documents and approvals due to safety issues he said.

It wasn't until the sixth product that Peterson began to see real progress. By this time he started to understand that there are key variables that make up a good product idea.

""On Amazon there are millions of shoppers and the goal is to find a product that people are already searching for. And I didn't quite understand that concept"" Peterson said of his first few attempts.

Within six months of starting or by May of 2018 he told Insider he was able to replace his income which wasn't much money at the time. His 9-to-5 salary while working for his dad was about $36000 a year. Peterson was 22 years old and his expenses were minimal. Rent living in Bluffdale Utah was about $1000 and he wasn't living any lavish lifestyle. Once he began to make about $2500 in profit he was comfortable enough to quit his job.

""Looking back on it it didn't feel real. What's crazy about Amazon is I'm not doing the fulfillment. I'm just the middleman. Amazon is doing the fulfillment and all I see are numbers on the screen saying; 'Hey I got X amount of orders'"" Peterson said. ""And I don't see the inventory being processed. I don't see the inventory being sent to the customer. So it didn't really feel real until I got a big fat deposit from Amazon. I was like wait this is real.""

Advertisement

A few key lessons he learned included that the keywords related to a product that people are searching for should have a certain amount of search volume and there are software tools that provide that data from Amazon. Peterson started by using Jungle Scout a tool for search and market analytics. Today he uses something similar called Helium 10 a Chrome extension that also shows him how much other sellers are making from that same product.

With these tools Peterson realized that the sweet spot was finding products with low competition but high demand. Finally the few competitors already selling the product should have high profits. He's now selling keychains small wallets and party decorations because they're in that sweet spot.

His first recommendation for anyone starting off is to look around at the products you already use on a regular basis. For example he was driving around his neighborhood and saw a house with a big ""happy birthday"" sign in the yard. He thought to himself that might be a good product to consider selling.

Once you have a few ideas of the products you can do keyword searches to determine which ones fall within that sweet spot he noted.

Setting up the product

In the beginning Peterson spent more than 40 hours a week researching and setting up his products while he was working for his dad. Often that meant he'd be on his computer after work from 6:00 p.m. until 2:00 a.m. on some days. This was also because the manufacturers were in different time zones.

""The interesting thing with Amazon is it's definitely front-loaded. So the majority of the work is all upfront. You've obviously got to find a product you've got to find a manufacturer you've got to create your listing and take professional images"" Peterson said. ""There's a lot of work that goes into it upfront. But what's cool is once you have it set up you basically just click a few buttons you reach out to your manufacturer to reorder inventory and your manufacturer actually sends it directly from their manufacturer to Amazon.""

There are usually numerous manufacturers available on Alibaba for any given product. Peterson reaches out to as many as he can to request quotes understand the materials they use and what type of customizations they can do. He will often add his designs to certain products to make them unique. Once the product reaches an Amazon fulfillment center it's ready to sell he said.

Trevin Peterson

There are also costs associated with getting good photographs of the products. To keep costs down and make it simple Peterson told Insider he uses a photographer in China. The manufacturer ships one unit to the photographer who will take five to seven images for $150 he said.

When it comes to monthly expenses Peterson spends a lot on Amazon fees and advertising.

Overall his biggest expenses this year have been the cost of goods which amounted to $237025 followed by FBA Fees at $281079 and advertising costs at $162282. Amazon advertising is important because it allows customers to better find your product he said. It's a pay-per-click model. And the more clicks that result in a sale the more his product gets boosted to the top of Amazon's search page.

This year through November his revenue was about $961000. From that he has a take-home profit of about $282000 before tax according to a live video and screenshots of his payments dashboard which tracks his sales. November has been his highest month this year with over $107000 in revenue. The last two months of the year tend to be his most profitable as people shop for the holidays he said.

He now also has an Amazon sellers consulting and education firm called AMZ Champions. He also shares free tips on his YouTube channel Instagram and TikTok where his largest following is at over 374000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvY29tcHV0aW5nL2FtYXpvbi1raW5kbGUtc2NyaWJlLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Kindle Scribe Review: The Jumbo E-Reader You've Been Waiting For,"Stylus-equipped touchscreen E Ink digital notepads have been around for a while but with the arrival of Amazon's Kindle Scribe we're suddenly seeing a lot more interest in these types of devices. The 10.2-inch Scribe is not only the largest Kindle e-reader to date it's the first time Amazon has brought precision pen input to the Kindle line.

To be clear the Scribe is not cheap: It costs more than the Kindle Oasis or an entry-level iPad starting at $340 with a standard ""pen"" or $370 with a premium pen and 32GB of storage.

But after using the Scribe for a week I can say it's mostly an excellent tablet-style e-reader though there's certainly room for improvement with software and feature updates particularly on the note-taking side of things.

The first thing you'll notice about the Kindle Scribe is that it's big -- a lot bigger than the Kindle Paperwhite. It kind of looks and feels like a jumbo Kindle Oasis minus the physical page-turn buttons and waterproofing (both the Paperwhite and Oasis are waterproof with an IPX8 rating).

Like the Oasis it has a flush-front design and according to Amazon is made of recycled aluminum and is currently the only front-lit 10.2-inch e-reader with a high-resolution 300 pixels-per-inch E ink display. A mere 5.8mm thick (0.22 inch) it weighs in at 433 grams (0.95 pound). For comparison the Kindle Paperwhite weighs in at 205 grams and the new upgraded baseline Kindle (2022) is 158 grams.

The iPad (2022) weighs a touch over a pound (477 grams) and like the iPad you can certainly hold the Scribe in your hand whether it's your left or right hand (the screen flips according to whether you prefer a left- or right-hand orientation). However you're probably not going to want to do that for long periods. You'll either want to set it down on a table and prop it up at an angle with some object or ideally buy a folio cover that converts into a stand.

If you buy one of Amazon's covers which the Scribe adheres to magnetically it'll cost you an extra $60 for a fabric cover or $80 for a leather version (you can also buy a Scribe and case together with one of the Scribe Essentials bundles that start at $410 and include a premium pen and power adapter). Other third-party cases are available for less (they all tend to have some sort of loop to store the pen). But Amazon's cases are attractive slim and allow you to prop up the device at a couple of angles. It's also worth noting that the pen adheres magnetically to the side of the Scribe even if you have a cover on it (the side of the Scribe remains exposed with Amazon cases).

Both the standard stylus and premium pens don't require power or Bluetooth connectivity and use electro-magnetic resonance technology so you'll never need to worry about charging them. The premium pen has an eraser (you turn the pen over and press the erase button on top of the stylus against the screen just like you would a real pencil eraser) and a programmable button for $30 more.

Amazon sells a folio cover for the Scribe that converts into a kickstand. Amazon

The review sample I received included the premium pen which worked quite smoothly for taking handwritten notes and drawing on the screen. There's virtually no lag and it felt natural -- pretty much like writing on a piece of paper with less friction. There are five pen thicknesses to choose from as well as five thicknesses for the highlighter. Some additional pen styles would be nice and I did have to be a little careful with how I held the pen because I accidentally hit the programmable button on a few occasions as I was writing or doodling (I write left-handed).

But if you're at all interested in the premium pen it's best to buy it with the Scribe because it's $60 ($30 more) if you buy it separately. The pen tips are replaceable Amazon says.

Large crisp display with uniform lighting

Aside from the 300 ppi display which shows texts and images with good sharpness the Kindle Scribe's front-light scheme is composed of 35 LEDs. That compares with 25 LEDs for the Kindle Oasis 17 LEDs for the Kindle Paperwhite and four LEDs for the 2022 entry-level Kindle. You can adjust the color temperature from a warmer sepia tone to a cooler more bluish one. I generally kept it toward the warmer side which gives it a more paperlike appearance and like with other Kindles for night reading there's a dark mode that turns the screen black (or actually very dark gray) with letters and images appearing in white or shades of gray.

The lighting has excellent uniformity to it and the touchscreen is quite responsive with the overall performance for an E Ink e-reader being top-notch despite the inherent laggy nature of E Ink. The Scribe runs on the same Mediatek system on a chip that runs the Paperwhite. It's capable of running up to 2GHz but only does so for certain applications that require higher performance according to Amazon. As for storage the base model has 16GB but 32GB and 64GB configurations are available for more money. The Scribe is Wi-Fi-only Kindle with no cellular option.

The power (and limits) of note-taking on the Scribe

While the 9.7-inch Kindle DX was discontinued around 10 years ago the Scribe is its spiritual successor and a great choice for sight-challenged folks looking for a large Kindle that has the ability to display more lines of text at larger font sizes.

In the past that was the biggest appeal of larger format e-readers (and that their screens wouldn't get washed out in direct sunlight making them great for reading outdoors). But in recent years we've seen more of these stylus-equipped touchscreen e-readers finding a market with students and other folks looking for a dedicated E Ink device that offers note-taking and annotation capabilities without the distractions found in a feature-packed iPad or Android tablet (and that includes Amazon's own Fire tablets) which offer everything from web browsing to video watching to gaming. The Kindle Scribe like other Kindles has a rudimentary web browser but it seems mainly designed to allow you to enable a Wi-Fi connection in public places like coffee shops and hotels where some web authentication is necessary.

Fellow CNET writer Sarah Lord has used more tablet-style e-readers but I have tested the Kobo Elipsa which is arguably the Scribe's most direct competitor and has been on the market for a while. It sells for $360 in a bundle that includes a cover and Kobo stylus. It has a front light but the big difference is that its display is 227 ppi compared to 300 ppi for the Scribe's display. It's a noticeable difference.

With the Elipsa you can mark up Kobo ebooks. However the one current shortcoming of the Scribe is that you cannot mark up Kindle ebooks or even DRM-free ePub ebooks (non-copy-protected ePub files). With e-books you have to use Amazon's Sticky-note feature which is available with other Kindles. You tap and hold on a word then slide the pen across whatever words or sentences you want to select. Lift the pen and you have the option to create a handwritten or text note highlight the word or sentence or share it.

Personally I'm not someone who likes to mark up books and take notes in the margin so I don't mind the sticky-note functionality but lots of today's students do mark up their physical school books (my kids certainly do) and it would be nice to have the ability to make notes in the margins and circle sentences and whatnot.

As it stands you can import a variety of file formats and document types to mark up if you so choose. You can import and write directly on-page in PDF documents (so if you had an e-book as PDF file it could be marked up) and I found it easy to import PDFs using Amazon's Send-to-Kindle feature where you simply drag a file into a box on the Send-to-Kindle web page and it gets sent your Kindle (there are other options to send files including via the Kindle app for iOS Mac and Android as well as via email). It's also easy to export files via email.

Unfortunately marking up PDFs isn't as seamless or intuitive as it is on other E Ink tablets. When you're in a PDF you aren't able to adjust the font size or layout so instead you have to pinch-to-zoom in order to enlarge or reposition the document. That part works well and it's not too hard to find a level that works best for you. Once you're positioned in your PDF you can't stay there. With the launch software the Scribe makes it impossible to maintain your current zoom levels from one page to the next. Instead you have to zoom all the way out again in order to swipe to the next page just to reposition it all over again. This can make reading long PDFs cumbersome.

You can keep a journal with the Scribe and upload your entries to the cloud (free storage included). Amazon

You can also import and create handwritten sticky notes in Microsoft Word docs (DOCX DOC) HTML EPUB TXT RTF JPEG GIF PNG and BMP text and graphic files but not in manga comics graphic novels magazines or newspapers. Like with other recent Kindles you can listen to Audible audio format (AAX) or text-to-speech audio with Bluetooth headphones or speakers. Additionally Amazon says it's working with Microsoft to allow you to export a Word doc directly from a computer to your Kindle Scribe within that Word doc. That feature is coming in 2023 Amazon says along with the ability to sync.

For free note-taking doodling or creating notebooks and journals the Scribe has 18 templates to choose from including six lined options graphing paper musical notation and to-do lists. You can organize your notebooks in folders and search by their titles and Amazon says that in early 2023 you'll be able to get access to your notebooks through the Kindle app sync feature on other devices.

However as my colleague Sarah Lord -- who also spent time with the Scribe -- notes ""All of that is great but these notebooks lack any smart features. For example there's no way to insert equations or convert your handwriting to text. Similarly you don't get any help in drawing shapes or straightening lines. And while you can export your notebooks via email there's no support for Dropbox or any other third-party service."" That may not be a big deal for some folks but the long and short of it is that serious note-takers might want more.

Lord says she prefers the ReMarkable 2 as a pure note-taking E Ink tablet but it has its limitations as an e-reader and obviously doesn't include access to Amazon's extensive Kindle eco-system and its massive library of ebooks.

Kindle Scribe final thoughts

The big question for a lot of people will be whether to buy a Kindle Scribe or perhaps a new iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab S the best Android tablet (or so a lot of people say). While you still have to buy some sort of stylus for an iPad (while Samsung's Galaxy Tab S8 series includes a stylus iPads don't) it clearly offers a lot more functionality zippier performance and high-resolution color display (alas we're still waiting for color E Ink). You can certainly take notes and mark up documents with an iPad -- and also basically use it as a computer particularly if you link a keyboard to it.

But as I said earlier the Scribe is for someone looking for a distraction-free device with a specific purpose and I do think it has some room to grow a bit with software and feature updates some of which we know are coming in 2023.

Compared to a tablet it also delivers much better battery life. You can get up to three months of battery life if you just use the Scribe as an e-reader (based on 30 minutes of reading a day) but note-taking draws more energy and cuts battery life down considerably. However depending on usage you can still get weeks of battery life while note-taking and doodling. It charges via USB-C -- a cable but no power adapter is included -- and using a 9-watt or higher adapter does speed up charging just like it does with your iPhone or Android smartphone.

The Scribe's size and weight make it more of a burden to carry around especially when you consider the smaller baseline Kindle can fit into a coat pocket. But in all the Scribe strikes a very good balance between a large-format e-reader and an E Ink note-taking tablet. Folks will probably have some quibbles about the Scribe's high price and the robustness of its mark-up and note-taking capabilities but I do expect we'll see the device improve in the coming months.

Photographed on December 2 2022.(Marc Lester / ADN)

Amazon is turning a former Sears warehouse in Anchorage into a sorting facility.

The world’s largest e-commerce retailer will establish a “state of the art” distribution and warehouse center at 5900 Old Seward Highway off Dowling Road with enough parking space to handle more than 100 delivery vans according to Amazon permit applications for the project filed with state and federal agencies.

The company plans to expand the 90000-square-foot warehouse and parking lot adding 125 parking stalls for workers and additional space for loading products outside a docking area and for the safe flow of vehicles the applications show. The building was previously a Sears service center and repair site.

“This new facility will help improve Alaska’s supply chain disruptions provide a facility for goods from outside Alaska to be efficiently distributed to Alaskan communities and build the economy through increased employment and commerce” according to a description of an Amazon application for water quality certification with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.

Amazon is constantly exploring new locations and weighing various factors as it decides where to develop sites that best serve customers said Eileen Hards an Amazon public relations manager in an emailed statement on Sunday.

“While we aren’t commenting on specific operation plans we’re actively exploring options locally” she said. “Our commitment to communities is to be a good neighbor assess how we can invest create jobs and integrate well into the region.

Bill Popp president of the Anchorage Economic Development Corp. said the expansion of Amazon’s footprint in Alaska highlights the “dramatic rise” in online shopping in Alaska during the pandemic accelerating a trend that was already underway.

“Combined with increased access to broadband services this new distribution facility is a clear indication of just how much local consumers have increased their purchases through online services” he said.

[The pandemic years changed shopping in Anchorage. Maybe forever.]

Amazon’s applications did not say how many jobs the center will create. Construction is scheduled to begin in the spring.

Amazon schedules about one flight daily into the Fairbanks International Airport and about one or two flights daily into the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport with products from outside the state officials at the airports said.

A new sorting center in Anchorage will create valuable jobs Popp said.

“This is going to put a little more economic value from the Amazon supply chain into Anchorage” he said.

Jobs at the Amazon facility would increase the roughly 4500 warehouse jobs in Anchorage which pay an average of more than $66000 annually he said.

Those jobs are part of a “hot” business sector — trade transportation and utilities he said. It’s the only Anchorage sector beating its 2019 job numbers before the pandemic.

Employment associated with cargo handling at the Anchorage international airport a top global cargo hub is a key reason for that outperformance Popp said. UPS and FedEx two of the world’s largest shipping companies have major global cargo operations at the Anchorage airport. They and other companies have proposed new cargo-handling facilities at the airport as global air trade has grown.

Amazon’s proposed sorting facility is located about four miles southeast of the Anchorage international airport.

Amazon’s application with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers calls for the placement of 3673 cubic yards of fill such as gravel into two acres of wetlands. The location is just east of Campbell Creek.

The application calls for Amazon to expand the parking lot covering wetlands that are next to the existing parking lot said Becky Manbeck an official with the Corps’ Fairbanks office. To manage storm water drainage at the new development subsurface pipes will be installed and storm water runoff will be filtered through “arched chambers” before it is discharged into Campbell Creek according to the application before the Corps.

[The great mismatch: Remote jobs are in demand but positions are drying up]

The former Sears warehouse was sold this year to Time Equities an international real estate firm part of a $44 million deal that also included the sales of Sears’ former property at the Midtown Mall in Anchorage. Time Equities is still listed as the building owner on city property records.

Popp said the project illustrates the global change in shopping habits.

Amazon has became an international giant as more shoppers have increased their online buying creating challenges for brick-and-mortar competitors. Sears went bankrupt in 2018 amid speculation it couldn’t effectively adapt to digital shopping.

“It is unfortunate the old retail models don’t work the way they used to” Popp said. “It’s the nature of creative destruction and e-commerce is the way many consumers get the products they need.”

The data found the rainforest lost an area covering over 11000 square kilometers in the period from August 2021 to July 2022.

That was down 11 percent from the previous year when more than 13000 square kilometers were destroyed.

The data was recently released by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research. The agency is part of the country’s Ministry of Science. The institute uses a monitoring system that collects satellite images of the rainforest to measure deforestation rates.

For a period of more than 10 years improvements were seen in the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation rates dropped and stayed below 10000 square kilometers a year. But that changed in January 2019 when far-right President Jair Bolsonaro took office.

Researchers and environmentalists have blamed Bolsonaro’s policies for causing sharp increases in deforestation rates. Bolsonaro is set to leave office on January 1 after recently losing reelection to former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Part of the destruction that took place under Bolsonaro will not appear until next year’s report including the important period from August to October 2022.

A different federal satellite monitoring system shows deforestation rose 45 percent during the August to October period. But while that system provides faster results it is not as accurate as the other methods The Associated Press reports.

Traditionally the August to October period sees higher rates of deforestation because it is during the dry season.

An examination of new data was also completed by the Climate Observatory a collection of environmental groups. It showed that during the four years of Bolsonaro's leadership deforestation rose 60 percent over the previous four years. That is the largest percentage rise under a president since satellite monitoring began in 1998.

In one state Para deforestation dropped 21 percent. But it still represented one-third of all Brazil's Amazon forest loss. Part of the tree cutting and burning happens in areas that are supposed to be protected. One such area is Paru State Forest where the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment registered 2 square kilometers of deforestation in October alone.

“In recent years deforestation has reached protected areas where previously there was almost no destruction"" said Jakeline Pereira a researcher with the Amazon Institute. Pereira told the AP “In Paru's region the destruction is driven by lease of land for soybean crops and cattle.”

Bolsonaro's administration has been blamed for weakening environmental agencies and supporting legislative measures to ease land protections in favor of economic development.

Brazilian President-elect da Silva recently promised cheering crowds at the U.N. climate conference in Egypt to end all deforestation across the whole country by 2030. “There will be no climate security if the Amazon isn’t protected” he said.

The last time da Silva was president from 2003 to 2010 deforestation fell sharply. On the other hand he backed measures that set in motion destruction in the long run. These included his support for the huge Belo Monte hydroelectric dam project and providing large loans to the beef industry. Cutting down forest to create feeding areas for cattle is a main driver of deforestation.

The Amazon rainforest covers an area twice the size of India. It acts as a buffer against climate change by taking in large amounts of carbon dioxide. It is also the most biodiverse forest in the world and the home of tribes that have lived in the area for thousands of years.

American Airlines is closing its San Francisco base potentially displacing 400 flight attendants.

Two-thirds have worked for the airline for 13 years or more according to union calculations.

10 flight attendants told Insider a myriad of factors make it difficult to leave the Bay Area.

The mass email hit some flight attendants' inboxes mid-flight.

""Today it's with great regret that I let you know about our decision to close the SFO flight attendant base"" American Airlines executive Brady Byrnes said in the September memo obtained by Insider.

In closing its San Francisco base citing economic factors and shifting customer demand American presented 400 flight attendants with a choice that many said felt impossible to make: leave the airline or leave the state.

The base is home to some of the carrier's most senior flight attendants two-thirds of whom have been at the airline for 13 years or more according to the union representing American Airlines flight attendants. By January 31 they must select an airport from a list of the airline's hubs outside of California to work out of. For those who can't or won't the only options are to retire early (if eligible) or resign the union told Insider.

In interviews 10 SFO-based flight attendants told Insider that a myriad of factors make it difficult to leave the Bay Area. (Some have asked to remain anonymous in fear of losing their jobs but Insider verified their identities and employment.) Some are single moms some are battling health issues some have children with special needs. Others have divorced spouses with joint custody of their children elderly parents or partners who can't uproot their careers.

""This is home"" said Marcia Brown a flight attendant who has been based in San Francisco for 38 years.

An American Airlines spokesperson said it decided to no longer have flight attendants based in San Francisco based on logistical factors including the airline's changing size shifting customer demand and fleet changes.

""As we look at the future of our network we expect that San Francisco will maintain the same level of flying it does today but there are no plans to grow San Francisco and no future flying prospects based on our current network strategy"" they said.

Most SFO-based routes rank poorly for profitability compared to other routes across American's network according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. This year the carrier cut the volume of flights out of San Francisco by approximately one-third Cirium told Insider.

In June the Supreme Court ruled that a state law requiring workers get a break every few hours does in fact apply to California-based airline employees.

Some SFO-based flight attendants suspect they don't have the option to transfer to Los Angeles — a larger American hub — because the airline could exit California altogether.

American would have a ""good business reason"" to do so John Masslon a senior litigator at the Washington Legal Foundation told Insider especially when considering the airline's $37 billion debt.







""You might have situations where the plane is unable to take off because of having to wait for a rest or meal break"" he said. ""Planes will be unable to land and it will have a cascading effect on delayed flights and mess up the entire system.""

A bitter ending

At 64-years-old Brown plans to retire early despite wanting to continue working.

""It's hurtful that I've given them 38 years of my life and this is how I go out"" she said. ""I hate leaving feeling angry and bitter. I wanted to leave feeling sad because it's been a great career.""

Flight attendants who can't retire early or move will have to commute which in the airline business means flying standby to get to and from their new base.

The closest bases to SFO are Phoenix and Dallas 2-hour and 3.5-hour flights respectively and not all 400 of the affected flight attendants will receive their first choice. Less-senior employees may be stuck commuting across the country adding dozens of unpaid hours to their schedules.

Cynthia Duarte a 38-year veteran worries that the extra time she'd have to spend commuting would make it impossible to care for her husband who has terminal brain cancer.

""Right now I'm only gone for one day two times a week and he can barely handle that. You add a three-hour commute on to that and my time away triples"" Duarte said. ""I never thought at our age we would be dealing with an illness that makes every moment count. We don't know how many we have left.""

Many of her colleagues are in similarly tough situations.

A single mom and flight attendant of over 20 years doesn't know how she'd commute and secure extra childcare for her young child who needs an insulin pump changed every three days. A 30-year veteran battling a life-threatening illness said she can't afford to lose the company's health insurance so she plans on flying the three hours to Dallas and back for each shift.

Anthony Cataldo a flight attendant of 33 years said he plans on commuting to American's New York City base— a 5.5-hour flight for which he'll compete with other flight attendants for a standby seat. He estimates commuting will cost him up to $700 a month between hotel rooms which aren't provided by the company in a situation like this and parking.

If a flight attendant misses a shift due to a lack of standby space only three missed shifts per year are allowed. After that each missed commuter shift results in two attendance ""points."" Employees with 11 points are subject to termination according to American's attendance policy.

One flight attendant a single mother who has worked for American for over 20 years said she's looking for a new job to avoid needing to move or commute out-of-state. ""I have no one anywhere else. This is where my family is. This is where my support system is.""

A dream denied

In an industry where seniority determines scheduling and pay every year brings flight attendants closer to working international flights top wages of $68.25 per hour and more schedule flexibility and customization. For many it's an end goal that can make the low starting pay night shifts and grueling reserve hours all worth it.

The decades of experience with the goal of achieving that lifestyle are now effectively lost one flight attendant told Insider.

""I put in over 20 years and now they're telling me that I may not be able to put in the rest of my years"" she said. ""My plan was to retire at American.""

In a town hall meeting on September 27 company representatives told SFO-based flight attendants that after several calculations the carrier determined that operating a base out of San Francisco was simply not financially viable according to an audio recording shared with Insider by a verified source.

Some employees expressed confusion on why they need to leave San Francisco if the carrier will still need to staff SFO flights. American specifically expressed plans to keep flights at the same level as today meaning the airline will have to fly in flight attendants based at other airports.

Considering the airline also said it will continue to hire new flight attendants several crew members said it feels as though the airline wants to replace its veteran staff with new employees who are paid much less.

""We have a 17-year-old daughter who's graduating high school this year and an 11-year-old daughter. It doesn't make sense for me to ask my family to move"" Louis Rangel who started working for American in 1988 and grew up in the Bay area said.

""I don't know how to start over"" he continued. ""It's hard for many of us to think that someone you've been dedicated to for 30 plus years and then just nope this is it: Take it or leave it.""

But flights in and out of Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport dropped to about 3000 this year from 6000 in 2019 according to data from Cirium an aviation analytics firm — and prices have gone up so much that sometimes she takes a four-hour bus ride to New York City to take advantage of airfares that are hundreds of dollars cheaper. “There is definitely more of a barrier to getting home” she said.

An unexpected hangover of the pandemic has been the withered flight schedules at many regional airports. Of the 430 airports in the continental United States and Hawaii that offered commercial passenger service before the pandemic 76 percent had fewer flights scheduled in 2022 than in 2019 according to the Regional Airline Association.

Smaller airports lost “a dramatically higher percentage” of their flights than larger airports Faye Malarkey Black chief executive of the association wrote in an email. Those airports lost an average of 34 percent of their flight traffic while larger airports’ schedules shrank an average of 16 percent.

This September American Airlines ceased flying to Ithaca and Islip’s MacArthur Airport in New York — as well as Toledo Ohio and Dubuque Iowa — bringing the total number of airports where it has canceled service to 15.

When I first saw DataScalp -- I know the name doesn't resonate with prettiness -- I wondered whether the creator's own eyes and life experience hadn't been quite what they could have been.

That name may inspire some to muse: ""Dear Lord why?"" And the site well it looks like a forgotten concoction from 1997's less creative period.

Yet DataScalp's mission is to make your flying experience better thanks to oh yes data. And not data provided by DataScalp but by miserable people like you who have endured terrible flying experiences.

What the site provides is a running score of airline cancellations baggage accuracy on-time performance and cancellation time to refund.

But I ask you can't you already find all this around the web? Doesn't this information already exist? And perhaps most importantly given that Americans have so few actual choices when they fly will this data influence any human behavior?

I asked DataScalp's creator Dwight Harris Jr. about some of my misgivings.

He told me: ""This content relies upon inferential statistics to mimic the information that airlines actually have but withhold. DataScalp content is based upon commodity services. It's not based upon taste like Yelp which is subjective and does not allow ranking.""

He also offered an intriguing thought: ""Consumers gravitating towards good performers leaves inventory abundance for airlines which pushes prices down. Therefore consumers via DataScalp literally impact prices unlike any other platform.""

I wonder if that'll be the case.

And what of the name? Isn't it a little contentious?

Not to Wright Jr.: ""You scalp tickets so DataScalp removes the ambiguity around information. Coming up with any company name and website that has the word data is extraordinarily difficult. DataScalp as a name is a godsend.""

Who am I to argue when God is invoked?

But the airlines have now got their act together haven't they? At least that's what the airlines say. Why the Thanksgiving period seemed relatively peaceful. Even Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg thought so.

Ah but Harris Jr. insists things will get worse. He told me: ""The only reason Thanksgiving travel was relatively easy was due to climate change providing a relatively warm November. But airlines haven't changed anything. So when the weather gets colder it's going to exacerbate problems that have always been there.""

Yes but it's always been this way hasn't it? Especially on the east coast. Nothing can change the shifting tides of storms.

Harris Jr. doesn't agree. He said: ""Airlines aren't going to change until we get reliable customer feedback that can't be siloed or hidden in one of those customer feedback forms. While DataScalp isn't pretty it's ready to fix an ugly problem: Airline travel.""

Also: In-flight Wi-Fi is a nightmare but fixes could be on the way

I confess to finding it hard to see how the collected thoughts of angry American flyers can make any difference at all. It never has. Airlines know that you can complain all you like but when four airlines own more than 80% of the seats you have to take what you can get and be grateful you got to your destination.

Perhaps this winter will be DataScalp's takeoff. Hark at Harris Jr.'s portentous tones: ""Winter is coming for the airline industry. I expect December travel to be some of the worst yet.""

I suppose you have nothing to lose by offering your views to this new Reddit of the Air. And Wright Jr. insists his site will change human behavior. (Yes really.)

""I've worked on Wall Street for a decade"" he told me. ""I've successfully changed corporate behavior at the highest levels. This approach is proven to work.""

Earlier this month the North American Electric Reliability Corp. which sets and enforces reliability standards for the bulk power system in the U.S. Canada and part of Mexico said New England and parts of the South and Midwest are “at risk of having insufficient energy supplies during severe winter weather.”

The organization pointed to fuel supply problems potential shipping disruptions as the federal government works to avert a rail strike limited natural gas infrastructure fossil and nuclear plant retirements and high potential peak electric demand as contributing risk factors during sustained cold weather.

“While the grid has a sufficient supply of capacity resources under normal winter conditions we are concerned that some areas are highly vulnerable to extreme and prolonged cold” said John Moura NERC’s director of reliability assessment and performance analysis in a statement. “As a result load-shedding may be required to maintain reliability.” (Load-shedding means intentionally interrupting the flow of electricity to customers to reduce the strain on the grid.)

Warnings of potential outages in the South

NERC’s report says Texas which largely operates its own electric grid and much of Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi and the Carolinas are all vulnerable to extreme cold because it could trigger power plant outages and big spikes in demand. In many parts of the South electricity is the prime heating source and NERC says power generators and the fuel supply infrastructure that serves them “remain vulnerable without weatherization upgrades” despite improvements since Winter Storm Uri in 2021 which caused an estimated 246 deaths in Texas after the grid collapsed.

“While the risk of energy emergencies in the three areas hardest hit during that event has not been eliminated enhancements to equipment freeze protection and cold weather preparations for both the gas and electric industries is a positive step” said Mark Olson NERC’s manager of reliability assessments.

Duke Energy which has about 4.5 million electric customers in the Carolinas said it is prepared for extreme weather with well-stocked coal inventories that exceed pre-winter goals.

“We are ready to meet the energy needs of our customers every day regardless of the weather” said Bill Norton a company spokesperson. “As we do before each winter we have prepared for the possibility of extreme cold across our electric system.”

Norton also cited a power mix that includes renewables nuclear natural gas coal and hydroelectric power grid upgrades to serve a growing number of customers in North Carolina and plants that can run on more than one kind of fuel as key to guarding against outages caused by extreme weather.

MISO: Extreme cold weather would bring challenges

For the part of the grid overseen by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator an area that includes all or parts of 15 U.S. states (Arkansas Illinois Indiana Iowa Kentucky Louisiana Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana North Dakota South Dakota Texas and Wisconsin) NERC worries that more than 4.2 gigawatts of nuclear and coal power plants have been retired. That’s the rough equivalent of four large (1000 megawatt) power plants.

“An extreme cold-weather event that extends deep into MISO’s area could lead to high generator outages from inadequate weatherization in southern units and unavailability of fuel for natural-gas-fired generators” the report says.

MISO predicts its peak winter demand will be 102 gigawatts with 113 gigawatts of electric generation available “under normal grid conditions” Brandon Morris a spokesman said in an email. The organization’s all-time peak winter record for power demand was 109 gigawatts on Jan. 6 2017. However Morris said staff members from the organization noted in a winter readiness workshop last month that extreme cold weather intense winter storms and/or fuel supply issues could create challenges for MISO and local utilities.

Power generators in MISO however have shown improvement in preparing their plants for extreme weather according to a winterization survey the organization conducted Morris said.

In New England concerns about fuel delivery

New England relies on liquefied natural gas imports and oil-fired generators to meet peak demand days NERC said which means fuel delivery constraints and limited inventory of liquid fuels worsened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine could increase the chance that power plants might lack the fuel they need to run resulting in potential energy shortages in extreme weather.

Concerns about winter power in New England aren’t new. In an August letter to U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm Gordon van Welie president and CEO of ISO New England which is responsible for managing the flow of electricity for the six New England states noted that concerns about energy challenges in the region go back a decade. He added that even as the states in the region push to decarbonize it will rely on natural gas for the near future.

“During the coldest days of the year New England does not have sufficient pipeline infrastructure to meet the region’s demand for natural gas for both home heating and power generation” van Welie wrote adding that the organization has developed a tool to forecast potential energy shortfalls 21 days out and got federal approval to keep a natural gas fired plant running with access to liquefied natural gas imports.

“Based on these actions and the results of our winter assessment to date the ISO expects to be able to operate the system reliably in a mild to moderate winter (using established operational procedures to manage capacity deficiencies)” he wrote. “However concerns remain should the region experience an extreme winter.”

The organization wants the federal government to heed requests made last summer by New England governors including exploring suspension of the federal Jones Act which prohibits foreign vessels from transporting goods (like liquified natural gas) between U.S. ports and developing a regional energy reserve for fuel oil in the area among other asks.

NERC’s recommendations

NERC made a broad series of recommendations to mitigate risks to the power grid from extreme weather. First it said power generators should be preparing for winter conditions and communicating with grid operators. They also should ensure they have adequate fuel on hand and the organizations that monitor them should keep tabs on fuel supplies as well. But NERC also urged state regulators and policymakers to “preserve critical generation resources at risk of retirement prior to the winter season and support requests for environmental and transportation waivers.”

Holly Bender the Sierra Club’s senior director of energy campaigns called NERC’s suggestion to suspend environmental rules to keep fossil plants running “the wrong strategy.” Rather Bender said the report makes the case that reliance on fossil fuels itself poses risks and she urged state regulators to instead push energy efficiency and weatherization programs that will cut power use. “Whether it’s water shortages in the summer or frozen coal piles and short fuel supply in the winter fossil fuels like coal and gas struggle through extreme weather” she said. “In addition to the public health environmental and climate impacts fossil fuels are increasingly unreliable contributing to energy insecurity and unpredictable price spikes that impact the most vulnerable members of our communities the most.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMDQxMjIwMjIvY2FyYm9uLXJlbW92YWwtZm9zc2lsLWZ1ZWxzLXd5b21pbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carbon Removal Is Coming to Fossil Fuel Country. Can It Bring Jobs and Climate Action?,"Pipe Dreams: Part of a continuing series on whether capturing carbon is a climate solution or a dangerous distraction.

ROCK SPRINGS Wyo.—In early fall residents of this desolate corner of southwestern Wyoming opened their mailboxes to find a glossy flyer. On the front a truck barreled down a four-lane desert highway with a solar farm on one side and what looked like rows of shipping containers on the other. On the back was an invitation.

“CarbonCapture Inc. is launching Project Bison” it read announcing a “direct air capture facility” set to begin operations here next year. “Join us at our town hall event to learn more.”

Few had heard about the proposal before receiving the flyer let alone had any idea what a direct air capture facility was. So the following week about 150 people packed into a large classroom at Western Wyoming Community College in Rock Springs to find out.

“We are a company that takes CO2 out of the air and stores it underground” said Patricia Loria CarbonCapture’s vice president of business development in opening the meeting.

Loria described a plan to deploy a series of units—the shipping container-like boxes pictured on the flyer—that would filter carbon dioxide from the air and then compress the greenhouse gas for injection underground where it would remain permanently.

As carbon dioxide levels continue to climb scientists entrepreneurs and governments are increasingly determining that cutting emissions is no longer enough. In addition they say people will need to pull the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere and an emerging field of carbon removal also called carbon dioxide removal or CDR is attempting to do just that.

There are companies like Loria’s looking to use machines and others trying to accelerate natural carbon cycles by altering the chemistry of seawater for example or mixing crushed minerals into agricultural soils. These efforts remain wildly speculative and have removed hardly any of the greenhouse gas so far.

Some environmental advocates warn that carbon removal will be too expensive or too difficult and is a dangerous diversion of money and attention from the more urgent task of eliminating fossil fuels. Perhaps more troubling they say the various approaches could carry profound environmental impacts of their own disrupting fragile ocean ecosystems or swallowing vast swaths of agricultural fields and open lands for the energy production needed to power the operations.

Yet even as those potential impacts remain poorly understood the Biden administration is making a multi-billion dollar bet on carbon removal. The administration’s long-term climate strategy assumes that such approaches will account for 6 to 8 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas reductions by 2050 equal to hundreds of millions of tons per year and it has pushed through a series of laws to subsidize the technology.

The first investments will come from the Energy Department which is expected to open applications within weeks for $3.5 billion in federal grants to help build “direct air capture hubs” around the country with a particular focus on fossil fuel-dependent communities like Rock Springs where mineral extraction is by far the largest private employer. The goal is to pair climate action with job creation.

The money has prompted a rush of carbon-removal-focused companies to fossil fuel communities from Rock Springs to West Texas to California’s San Joaquin Valley seeding hope from supporters that a concept long relegated to pilot plants and academic literature is on the cusp of arriving as an industry.

As Loria made her pitch Lou Ann Varley was listening intently. Varley sits on a local labor union council and spent a 37-year career working at the Jim Bridger coal plant outside town before retiring in 2020. She knows that young workers starting at the plant today won’t be able to match her longevity there with its four units slated to close over the next 15 years and hoped Project Bison might offer some of them a new opportunity.

Others weren’t having it. Throughout the presentation residents listened quietly sitting in pairs at folding tables in the classroom. Some munched on sandwiches and cookies the company had provided. Others leaned back arms crossed. But when it came time for questions they launched a volley of concerns about the potential risks and unknowns.

Who was going to pay for this? Would it use hazardous chemicals? What about earthquakes from the underground injections of carbon dioxide? What would happen if the company went bankrupt and who would be liable in the event of an accident? Wyomingites are deeply protective of their open landscapes and many wondered about the impacts of all of the renewable energy that would be required for power.

Direct air capture machines consume tremendous amounts of energy. Project Bison according to CarbonCapture’s figures could eventually require anywhere from 5 to 15 terawatt hours of power per year equal to 30 percent to 90 percent of Wyoming’s current electricity consumption depending on whether the company can increase its efficiency.

Laura Pearson a sheep rancher who wore heavy work clothes was sitting in the back row that night feeling deeply skeptical of the entire premise. Pearson’s family has worked the same land for generations and she sees the wind farms and solar panels that have started covering parts of her state as a threat to its open range. “If you don’t think those affect wildlife and livestock grazing and everything else in this state” she told Loria from across the room “you’re crazy.” Loria said the company was working with wildlife scientists and officials to minimize impacts but Pearson was unswayed. “I love Wyoming and I don’t want to see it change” Pearson said after the meeting ended. She said she doubted the company’s intentions didn’t think carbon dioxide posed such a threat to the planet and didn’t like seeing out-of-state interests whose demands for cleaner energy have sent Wyoming’s coal sector into decline and are threatening to do the same for its oil and gas coming to peddle something new. “It’s all about the money” she said.

A Town With a Storied Coal History

Rock Springs was built on coal. In 1850 an Army expedition found coal seams cropping out of the valley bluffs. Less than 20 years later the Union Pacific Railroad routed the nation’s first transcontinental line through here so its locomotives could refuel as they crossed the Rockies. The mines soon snaked right under the center of town where the outlaw Butch Cassidy once worked at a butcher shop and earned his nickname.

The rail line still bisects the town although the old station has been converted into the Coal Train Coffee Depot cafe. A large sign arcs above the tracks outside: “Home of Rock Springs Coal Welcome.” A stone monument next to the depot lists everyone who died in the mines each year coming by the dozen in the early 1900s with names like Fogliatti Mihajlovic and Papas reflecting all the countries from which men flocked to find work.

Varley started at Jim Bridger one of the country’s largest coal plants in 1983 after getting laid off from mining trona a mineral used in the manufacturing of glass detergents chemicals and other products. All but one of the eight largest private employers in Sweetwater County either mine or use the minerals and fossil fuels that underlie this part of Wyoming. As oil gas and coal operations have shed jobs in recent years the trona mines have absorbed many of the losses.

Varley began as a laborer sweeping and shoveling coal or ash before working her way up through operations and maintenance. Eventually she helped operate the computer systems that ran the plant. “I loved the job” she said.

Two years after retiring Varley still refers to Bridger as “my plant.”

Until recently her plant was facing the forced shutdown of some of its units for failing to meet federal pollution rules set by the Environmental Protection Agency. But in February Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon struck a deal to forestall any retirements by converting two of Bridger’s four units to burn natural gas instead. Still all of its units are expected to close within 15 years.

Wyoming produces about 40 percent of the nation’s coal so the fuel’s plummeting share in the nation’s electricity—from half in 2005 to about 20 percent this year—has brought acute anxiety to towns like Rock Springs.

“It makes it kind of tough when you know that they’re talking towards phasing out coal” Varley said. Many people who work at the plant which employs more than 300 get angry about the prospect she said. “Especially some of the younger ones because they hired in believing like me that they would be able to retire from that facility.”

Wyoming officials have spent years trying everything to promote carbon capture technology which removes carbon dioxide from power plant or industrial emissions in the hope it could save coal. The state university has mapped its geology for places to store CO2. Regulators won federal approval to oversee the underground injection of carbon dioxide one of only two states to do so along with North Dakota. (The EPA oversees the practice everywhere else.) In 2020 Wyoming lawmakers passed a law that tried to force utilities to install carbon capture equipment at their coal plants.

These efforts have not yielded a single commercial carbon capture operation at a power plant but they do seem to have attracted CarbonCapture Inc. to the delight of state economic development officials.

A California-based start-up CarbonCapture said it has secured enough private investment to begin work next year on the Wyoming plant although it still needs to receive state and local permits. Rather than attaching to a coal plant this project would pull carbon dioxide out of ambient air by passing it through giant fans fitted with a chemical sorbent which traps the CO2. The sorbent is then heated to release the gas for compression before being reused.

Project Bison would initially capture 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year but the company said it plans to expand to reach a capacity of 5 million metric tons by 2030. That higher figure would be orders of magnitude above what any company has achieved so far yet roughly equal to the emissions of one coal power plant or less than 0.1 percent of total U.S. emissions of nearly 6 billion metric tons in 2020.

The operations would be financed by selling carbon credits to corporations seeking to offset their own emissions. The company said it has already sold credits at $800 per ton to Cloverly a carbon-offset marketer and to CO2.com a new carbon offset venture of TIME the magazine owned by the billionaire Marc Benioff.

Varley had gone into the town hall meeting feeling optimistic that the project could potentially provide high-quality jobs while also helping the environment. While she wants the coal plant to continue operating for as long as possible she knows its days are numbered and when it closes it could take more than 300 jobs with it.

Southwest Wyoming is hard country to live in: Varley has spent her entire life here and said “it grows on you like a fungus.” The state has the highest suicide rate in the country and the decline of fossil fuels it feels to many will only make life harder.

“People are looking for ways to maintain our ability to live here” Varley said.

Birth of the Carbon-Removal Dream

The summer of 2022 was yet another season of climate extremes. Drought and severe heat covered large parts of China Europe Africa and North America. The United Kingdom recorded its hottest temperature ever. In Pakistan heavy rains submerged up to one-third of the country killing more than 1000 destroying crops and spreading vector-borne diseases like dengue fever.

These disasters have driven many people toward desperate acts of civil disobedience like a scientist who chained himself to the doors of a private jet terminal. They’ve also pushed many to conclude that carbon removal technologies however unlikely their deployment will now be necessary to avoid the worst impacts of warming.

When the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest report this year on how to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius it determined that at least some degree of carbon removal was needed but that the amount could vary drastically depending on how quickly fossil fuel consumption declined and whether nations adopt more sustainable practices.

The only scenarios that did not include meaningful levels of carbon removal generally required global energy use to decline which seemed unlikely especially if there was any hope of supplying electricity to the nearly 800 million people who currently lack it.

“It’s critical to have this tool” said Jennifer Wilcox the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management at the Department of Energy “and we need to have it on the order of gigatons” or billions of tons.

The last year has brought an explosion of funding to try to make that happen. In addition to the $3.5 billion that Congress allocated to the Energy Department for direct air capture hubs lawmakers earmarked another $1 billion for research and development this year and as part of the Inflation Reduction Act more than tripled the value of a federal tax credit for direct air capture.

United Airlines Airbus Microsoft Alphabet Meta Stripe and other corporations have collectively pledged billions more. The billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has funded a $100 million prize for carbon removal startups. The field is also one of the fastest growing areas of climate philanthropy.

So far however hardly any carbon dioxide has been pulled from the atmosphere. The largest direct air capture plant in operation opened by a company called Climeworks in Iceland pulls in about 4000 metric tons of CO2 per year. By contrast the Jim Bridger plant outside Rock Springs spewed out 10.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2021 alone.

Skeptics have noted how far carbon removal is from making a dent in global emissions. Supporters however argue that the rates of growth the industry must achieve to make a difference while high are comparable to what solar energy generation has seen since the 1990s.

The rush of funding and attention has prompted a new set of questions about carbon removal technologies. The concerns of many skeptics have moved beyond whether carbon removal can possibly work to wondering what it would look like if it somehow did.

Displacing Herds of Native Pronghorn

Pearson’s route to town takes her past Wyoming’s first utility-scale solar farm which was built in 2018. The 700-acre site was cleared of vegetation before the panels were installed and surrounded with a chain-link fence. Now it marks a shiny incongruous break in the high desert though it is hardly the only disturbance around with trona mines in each direction.

The sight of it was bad enough for Pearson and other residents but soon after the project’s completion residents noticed herds of pronghorn a fleet-footed antelope-like animal indigenous to the region tramping onto the highway. The area that the solar farm had enclosed it turned out had been used by resident pronghorn and the fences shut them out. The companies behind the project sponsored a study published last spring in a scientific journal that determined that the animals lost nearly a square mile of high-use habitat about 10 percent of their core range. Today the pronghorn’s trails and droppings line the perimeter of the fence that locked the animals out of lands they once called home.

Credit: Nicholas Kusnetz

CarbonCapture plans to build its new facility about 20 miles west of the solar farm a rough and barren landscape of greasewood and sagebrush and it could eventually need much more solar development to run its operations.

The company has said it will try to minimize the impacts by choosing lands already disturbed by oil development for example. But some will be unavoidable. State maps show that the sage grouse a protected game bird has core habitats surrounding the area where the plant would be built. Closer to the site cattle roam on rangeland that is dotted with oil wells and a creek trickles south on its way to the Green River a tributary of the Colorado.

CarbonCapture said it would initially use natural gas to power its operations while capturing the resulting carbon dioxide emissions but aims to eventually rely on renewable energy. At full scale that would require 1000 acres to house the energy supply and 100 acres more for the project itself.

The World Resources Institute an environmental think tank has estimated that if direct air capture technology reaches the scale envisioned by the Biden administration about 500 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year by mid-century the industry would consume more than 4 percent of the nation’s current total energy supply. If all that energy were generated by wind and solar power that could mean covering an area equal to a small state with turbines and panels.

The prospect alarms Pearson who said her family has been offered money to allow solar panels on their land but that they declined. “We would have been set for life and we said no way. Because we knew what it would do to the wildlife to our way of life to Wyoming’s way of life.”

Adrian Corless CarbonCapture’s chief executive said that because the project will connect to the electric grid the new renewable energy development could be located in other parts of the state or even out of state.

“There’s a lot of opportunity to find the right situations for land use that are aligned with community expectations and needs” Corless said.

Justin Loyka energy program manager in the Wyoming office of the Nature Conservancy said CarbonCapture asked his organization for help in reducing its impacts and that there were opportunities to do so. But he added that as renewable energy development spreads some impacts are inevitable.

“The vast majority of Wyoming is some of the most intact ecosystem in the lower 48” Loyka said. “Wyoming has these wildlife migration corridors that are hundreds of miles long and that really doesn’t exist in many other places.”

Even Varley who supports the project and views climate change as a concern is resistant to the new renewable energy development it would bring.

“Smug people in Teslas tell me about how bad my power plant is—and where does that power come from?” she said referring to the visitors’ cars.

“People in California don’t know the difference between a green electron and a black electron” Varley said adding “They want us to fix their problem.”

A Just Transition?

Last month the University of Wyoming announced it was “considering applying” for funding under the Energy Department’s direct air capture hub program along with the state economic development and energy agencies and put out an appeal to companies local governments or others interested in partnering. Corless said CarbonCapture would likely take part in that application.

The Energy Department has said that when it selects funding targets it “intends to use this program to support the creation of good-paying jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union the incorporation of strong labor standards and high-road workforce development.” At least two of four hubs must be in “economically distressed” parts of the country with “high levels of coal oil or natural gas resources.”

CarbonCapture has said that its project at full scale would create at least 200 jobs which would be significant but not enough to make up for the more than 300 now employed at the Jim Bridger coal plant. The first phase would entail more like 20 full-time positions Corless said though he added it would create far more construction jobs that could last for years.

Some local leaders will take what they can get.

“We talk about how our youth are our top export” said Devon Brubaker who runs a regional airport in Rock Springs and also sits on the county’s economic development coalition.

Demand for Wyoming’s fossil fuels is declining Brubaker said so people in the state need to be open to new ideas even when they clash with their conservative political leanings. “If people are willing to pay for carbon credits” he said “why should we stand in the way?”

Stressing the Land and the Wildlife

Perched above the Green River about halfway between Rock Springs and the stretch of oil and gas wells where CarbonCapture plans to build its plant Michele Irwin keeps a small herd of bison in a pen ringed by an electrified fence.

Irwin and her husband started raising the bison for meat for their family and to help supply animals to herds introduced on public lands around the region. But their real motivation was a love for the animals that they see as central to the region’s character and ecosystems and a dream that one day the bison might roam free once again.

Irwin is the southwest organizer for the Powder River Basin Resource Council a Wyoming environmental nonprofit and when she learned about CarbonCapture’s plans she was somewhat miffed by the “Project Bison” name.

“You talk about this thing about purchasing carbon credits. Well you know there you go” she said pointing to her animals as the sun set casting a sharp yellow hue across their matted fur. The bisons’ breaths roared through their nostrils like monstrous billows.

Bison were once a keystone species in ecosystems across the West. They grazed on native plants like sagebrush that cattle avoid. Their stampedes turned the soil and helped seeds germinate. The wallows that the bison dug by rolling in the dirt became ephemeral pools after scarce rains little watering holes.

Some academic research has suggested that restoring grassland ecosystems could help the land sequester far more carbon dioxide than it does today like a massive natural carbon removal helping to pull back what humans have released.

Perhaps the most fundamental critique of novel and technological approaches to carbon removal is that they miss the point. Climate change might be the largest environmental threat people face but it is merely one facet of the larger exploitative pressures that humans have exerted on the planet. Mass extinctions widespread chemical and plastic pollution and the wholesale replacement of wild species with domestic livestock have all tipped Earth toward a less hospitable state.

Through this lens of ecological collapse the idea that we would further stress the air water and land that surrounds us by altering ocean chemistry or building a new power-hungry industry seems wrongheaded to many.

Supporters of carbon removal say it should be pursued not as a replacement for emissions cuts but as insurance for when those reductions fall short. They argue that it is unrealistic to think that climate emissions from agriculture cement manufacturing aviation and other hard-to-abate sectors can be eliminated within 30 years while the global population swells toward 10 billion.

Failing to pursue carbon removal now said Danny Cullenward policy director at CarbonPlan a nonprofit that seeks to improve the transparency of carbon offsets and carbon removal would be like failing to pursue solar power 25 years ago when it was nascent and prohibitively expensive.

Irwin said she’s keeping an open mind about Project Bison and whether it might be part of a larger set of solutions. But she’d rather see Wyoming try a more holistic approach to preparing for a world of declining fossil fuel investment.

“If we keep on doing economic development from this perspective of ‘Oh here’s a project great let’s sign up for that one. Oh here’s a project. Oh let’s sign up for that one’” she said. “By the time you get all the permits together and I’m all done it’s like… There’ll be no putting it back together.”

Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the most recent death at the coal mines near Rock Springs occurred in 2005. It also incorrectly stated that Project Bison would require 5 to 15 terawatts of power. The project would require 5 to 15 terawatt hours of power per year.

(AP) — Tens of thousands of people braced for days without electricity in a North Carolina county where authorities say two power substations were shot up by one or more people with apparent criminal intent.

Across Moore County southwest of Raleigh on Monday businesses handed out free food or coffee and businesses without internet conducted transactions in cash. One local economic official described the area known for its golf courses and local pottery as “eerily quiet” at a time of year when businesses are normally full of tourists and holiday shoppers. County schools were closed.

Traffic lights were out throughout the county. Drivers treated intersections as four-way stops which caused some traffic in places such as downtown Carthage. A consistent hum of honks could be heard as people signaled to each other when they should go at each nonfunctional traffic light. Many local businesses and restaurants displayed “Closed” signs in the windows and had empty parking lots.

Kalai and Christine Balutski of Pinebluff sat under a heater Monday morning drinking warm beverages at the Red’s Corner food truck lot in Southern Pines. The couple has been without power since 7 p.m. Saturday and said they have been driving to restaurants in the next county over to eat warm meals and watch football while they wait for updates.

“We got two dogs at home so we can’t just up and leave” Kalai Balutski said. “We’re working off of a power brick to keep our phones charged and candles in one room to keep it warm enough to sleep.”

Bundled in a beanie boots and a Pittsburgh Steelers jacket Christine Balutski said she has been struggling to get work done for her remote IT job for the hospital system without WiFi access at home.

The Pinehurst Resort & Country Club has also been affected by the outage. With limited power generation capability at The Carolina Hotel the resort has consolidated all guests into rooms with available power. Golf courses remained open but the main clubhouse was closed.

Golf is played year-round in the Sandhills region and the Pinehurst resort is the No. 3 employer in Moore County — the largest only behind the local hospital and school systems according to government employment data. Moore County generated a record in visitor spending in 2021 leading to an economic impact of $673 million from the tourism industry the county’s economic development office said.

Moore County has dozens of golf courses anchored by eight at the Pinehurst Resort. Pinehurst’s famed No. 2 course has hosted three men’s U.S. Opens with the next to come in 2024. The World Golf Hall of Fame is also moving soon from Florida to Pinehurst.

Meanwhile federal state and local authorities were undertaking a massive investigation of what’s being described as a serious attack on critical infrastructure. Utility officials said it could take until Thursday to restore all power.

Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields said Sunday that authorities have not determined a motivation. He said someone pulled up breached the substation gates and opened fire at the substations.

He also said the substations were targeted: “It wasn’t random.”

Roughly 35000 electric customers in the county were without power Monday down by several thousand from the peak of the outages according to poweroutage.us. Temperatures dropped below freezing early Monday and lows in the 40s were expected again later in the week.

About 20 people spent the night at an emergency shelter at the Moore County Sports Complex in Carthage said Phil Harris executive director of the local American Red Cross chapter. Harris who’s managing a team of nine volunteers said plenty more have stopped by for food warmth or to charge their devices.

“If you’ve got no power you probably don’t have any heat so with winter weather coming in it’s a nice place to stay” Harris said.

Duke Energy spokesman Jeff Brooks said Sunday that multiple pieces of equipment were damaged and will have to be replaced. He said while the company is trying to restore power as quickly as possible he braced customers for the potential of outages lasting days.

“We are looking at a pretty sophisticated repair with some fairly large equipment and so we do want citizens of the town to be prepared that this will be a multiday restoration for most customers extending potentially as long as Thursday” Brooks said at the news conference.

The county of approximately 100000 people lies about an hour’s drive southwest of Raleigh.

The holiday season is one of the busiest times of year for the region’s tourism-dependent economy said Linda Parsons president of the Moore County Chamber of Commerce.

As they did during the pandemic businesses that can’t open or lack foot traffic were getting creative with online sales. Some hardware and other stores are doing cash-only transactions she said. Other businesses are offering free food to residents without power such as the Southern Pines Growler which gave out free coffee and pancakes Sunday.

“Our community has done an excellent job coming together … honestly it’s quite heartwarming” she said. “We’re making the best out of a bad situation.”

Andrew Wilkins a conservation advocate who grew up in Moore County was driving Saturday night from Washington to his parents’ small farm in Whispering Pines when he noticed the street lights were out in Carthage. He arrived to a “pitch black street” and little information about the cause or scope of the blackout.

“When the power was cut the flow of information was cut too” Wilkins told The Associated Press.

He spent the weekend helping his parents link a generator to their well for fresh drinking water and preparing them for cold nights without heat. Local grocery stores such as Food Lion and Harris Teeter have been distributing drinks ice and pantry items to those who lost power he said.

“Their home like many rural homes relies on a well for water for fresh clean water and it’s powered by electricity” Wilkins said. “So when the power went out the well stopped working and when the well stops working we slowly lose pressure until we lose water altogether. People are going to really feel the pinch from this as it goes on.”

Authorities have announced a mandatory curfew in a North Carolina county where around 40000 customers lost power after two power substations were damaged by gunfire Saturday night.

The county will implement a mandatory curfew from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m. starting Sunday night Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields said at a news conference Sunday.

Municipality and county officials “have formed a plan for the night and the next few nights that we may be out of power. It’s a very serious situation” Fields said. “So we’ve come to an agreement to best protect our citizens and to protect the businesses of our county we’re going to implement a curfew tonight.”

A state of emergency went into effect at 4 p.m. Sunday as law enforcement city and energy officials are investigating the incident and working to restore the two substations authorities said. Law enforcement has also been providing security for the stations according to the sheriff.

The power outage is being investigated as a “criminal occurrence” after crews found signs of potential vandalism at several locations CNN previously reported.

Fields said multiple rounds were fired at the two substations. “It was targeted it wasn’t random” he said.

No suspects have been identified in connection with the incident. Fields would not say if the criminal activity was domestic terrorism.

“The person or persons who did this knew exactly what they were doing” Fields said. “We don’t have a clue why Moore County.”

Fields acknowledged a woman who posted on Facebook Sunday morning indicating she had been questioned by law enforcement in connection with the incident. Fields did not name the woman but said she posted false information on social media claiming to have information behind the incident.

“We don’t have anything” Fields said when asked about a possible motive. “No motivation no group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who [did] it.”

A gate at one of the locations also appears to have been taken off its hinges Mike Cameron of the Southern Pines Fire and Rescue Department told CNN on Sunday afternoon.

Cameron said the area is experiencing increased emergency calls due to the lack of power adding that auto accidents have occurred because traffic lights are out. People who rely on oxygen have placed emergency calls he said.

More than 37000 customers were without power across the county Sunday evening according to the Duke Energy outage map. According to poweroutage.us about 38000 customers had lost power in Moore County and neighboring Hoke County.

Moore County Manager Wayne Vest said a shelter running on a generator opened Sunday afternoon at the Moore County Sports Complex in conjunction with the Red Cross. Vest said additional trailers with bathroom and shower facilities are also being brought to the shelter.

Power restoration could take until Thursday energy company says

The estimated cost of the substation damage is in the “millions” the sheriff said.

Restoration to the two substations could take until Thursday for some customers Jeff Brooks principal communications manager for Duke Energy said at Sunday’s news conference.

“We are going to be working around the clock all hands-on deck to get power back as quickly and safely as possible” Brooks said.

Duke Energy will continue to work with the Moore Sheriff’s Office and county officials to support the investigation.

Brooks said there had been “intentional impact” on the substation damaging multiple pieces of equipment of the substations causing power to go out. In this instance rerouting power is not an option he said.

“Equipment will have to be replaced” Brooks said. “We are looking at a pretty sophisticated repair with large equipment. This will be a multiday restoration for most customers extending possibly to Thursday.”

A local supermarket is distributing ice to impacted residents according to a news release from grocery chain Harris Teeter.

The power outage has also led officials to cancel Monday classes for all schools in the county. “An announcement will be made tomorrow evening to inform parents and staff of the status of schools for Tuesday” Moore County Schools said in a tweet Sunday afternoon.

FBI has joined the investigation congressman says

Several communities across the county began experiencing power outages just after 7 p.m. Saturday the Moore County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post.

“As utility companies began responding to the different substations evidence was discovered that indicated that intentional vandalism had occurred at multiple sites” the office said.

At least two substations were vandalized “with criminal intent” US Rep. Richard Hudson said Sunday morning in a release.

The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the FBI are responding according to Hudson. He said the motive remains unknown.

Hudson whose congressional district includes Moore County said the Southern Pines Police Department has opened a community center for residents to charge devices.

CNN has reached out to Southern Pines police and the FBI.

During the Sunday news conference Fields addressed rumors circulating on social media that the attack was an attempt to thwart a local drag show.

Fields said law enforcement is working every angle but “have not been able to tie anything back to the drag show” which was scheduled for Saturday night in the nearby town of Southern Pines.

On its website the Sunrise Theater advertised the “Downtown Divas!” drag show starting at 7 p.m. The power was cut shortly after that time Fields said.

CNN has reached out to the Sunrise Theater as well as the Southern Pines Police Department. CNN has also reached out to Sandhills Pride the organization behind Saturday’s drag event.

“This was a terrible act” North Carolina State Senator Tom McInnis said during the news conference. “And it appears to be an intentional willful and malicious act and the perpetrator will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Crews were experiencing “multiple equipment failures” that are affecting substations in Moore County Duke Energy spokesperson Brooks told CNN affiliate WRAL.

“We are also investigating signs of potential vandalism related to the outages” Brooks said.

Deputies and officers from other law enforcement agencies responded to the different sites to provide security according to the sheriff’s office.

Gov. Roy Cooper on Sunday tweeted that state law enforcement would join the investigation.

“I have spoken with Duke Energy and state law enforcement officials about the power outages in Moore County. They are investigating and working to return electricity to those impacted” Cooper said. “The state is providing support as needed.”

Moore County is in central North Carolina about 50 miles northwest of Fayetteville."

Should you use the one that says ""Delta"" on the front or should you pay with something else?

In many credit card decisions you may have to sacrifice benefits to earn additional points and miles. Does that hold true here? Let's look at which credit cards you might use to pay for a Delta flight and the benefits associated with your options.

Comparing credit cards for Delta Air Lines flights

In addition to using a Delta Air Lines cobranded credit card you also could pay with a travel rewards card that earns transferable points on travel purchases such as your next flight reservation with Delta. Here are some cards you might pay with and what you could get when using these cards:

Unlike the dilemmas when booking United Airlines flights there are no real trade-offs you must consider with Delta when it comes to enjoying benefits and earning as many points and miles as possible.

Benefits like free checked bags and priority boarding are attached to your Delta SkyMiles number not the credit card you pay with. That means you could theoretically pay for your Delta flight with the Amex Platinum Card to enjoy its insurance benefits and its unparalleled earning rates on flight purchases. However you would still enjoy checked bag benefits and early boarding benefits that come from having the Amex Delta Reserve card for example — even though you didn't pay for your flight with that card.

The only situation in which you must use your card is when you make an onboard purchase with Delta. To enjoy your 20% discount (in the form of a statement credit) make inflight food and beverage purchases with your eligible Delta card; if you pay with another card you won't receive this benefit. You may also be asked to show your Delta Reserve or Delta Reserve Business card when visiting lounges before your flight.

Bottom line

Options abound; there are many different credit cards you could use when paying for a flight — whether that's buying a cash ticket at a great price or paying the taxes and fees when redeeming your miles. If you're making a reservation with Delta Air Lines there are many benefits you may be able to enjoy on your flight simply by having a Delta credit card in your wallet.

The good news is that you can enjoy many of these benefits regardless of which credit card you use to pay for your flight. This leaves you free to use whichever card you want to enjoy the insurance protections or bonus points offered on other cards in your wallet.

Is there any merit to this charge?

Don’t Blame Middle Class For Subpar Airport Lounge Experience…

Here is how The Telegraph summarizes the problem:

Airport lounges were once upon a time the exclusive domain of the premium-class flier. Now there are many reasons why lesser mortals might have access. Credit cards like American Express’s Platinum Card offer it as a perk regular fliers can buy annual passes and even occasional travellers can often pay a one-off fee to secure a few hours of luxury before their departure. The inevitable problem with this democratisation of airport lounges is that these once-serene spaces have become oversubscribed undermining their very purpose. With the situation worsened by staffing issues many are now turning away customers who arrive more than three hours before their scheduled departure shrinking the window for relaxing pre-flight cocktails and canapes.

Indeed the problem is that demand greatly exceeds supply. Credit card companies (and your favorite bloggers) hawk credit cards that include access but this become theoretical when you are turned away at a lounge due to overcrowding.

> Read More: What Is The Value Of A Lounge That Is So Crowded You Cannot Enter It?

A few thoughts.

While we can pinpoint certain bottlenecks like the American Express Centurion lounges in Las Vegas or the Delta SkyClubs at New York JFK I am thankful the problem is not predictably widespread. I never have trouble finding a seat in the United Club at LAX or at most line stations (Denver is a mother story…). The point is that many of the lounge crowding issues are airport-specific and that leaves hope that those specific problems will be addressed.

Second blaming the middle class is great for an attention-grabbing headline but we must lay the blame where the blame is due: on the credit card companies. They are the ones who are pushing cards with lounge access that reasonable middle class people sign up for including me. Plus lounge operators agree to these deals knowing full well that demand may outstrip supply.

Third these credit cards are still worthwhile. Cards like the American Express Platinum Chase Sapphire Reserve or Capital One Venture cards offer a host of benefits and crowded lounges do not eliminate the value proposition that makes those cards more valuable than the annual fee.

My friend Gilbert Ott from God Save The Points is quoted extensively in the article. He complains about the quality control of these lounges lamenting “These pay-as-you-go lounges are a fundamentally flawed business model. I think it’s insane.”

I have to wonder whether we are the insane ones. After all we are the ones who show up early at the airport or brave lounge queues longer than at the security checkpoint for a few morsels of food or a cold drink.

Then again I value a lounge precisely for a snack and drink if I show up to the airport ahead of my flight.

CONCLUSION

Is it the middle class that is crowding lounges? Sure. There are more of us and we like good deals. But I would not blame the middle class for a problem that credit card companies and lounge operators have created by issuing so many cards that lounges cannot keep up. The solution may be the continued cutting of access and card benefits but don’t blame people for that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1LmVkdS9hcnRzL2plbm5pZmVyLXdlYmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Weber – Choreographer/Dancer » Arts Initiative,"Jennifer Weber – Choreographer/Dancer

The Gurnee Police Department responds to an armed robbery at the Portillo’s 6102 Grand Avenue in Gurnee on October 24 2022. (Joe Shuman/J. Shuman Photography (2022) )

The Portillo’s in Gurnee is no longer accepting cash from its drive-thru customers after an employee was robbed at gunpoint in the restaurant’s drive-thru in October. Portillo’s sent an email to its Gurnee customers on Monday notifying them about the change.

The restaurant located at 6102 West Grand Avenue said it would only accept Visa MasterCard Discover and American Express in the drive-thru going forward. The email specified that cash would no longer be accepted in the drive-thru but would still be accepted inside the business.

The email said the change was made because it is “safer for our team members” and “faster service for you.” The change comes after the location was robbed at gunpoint in October.

Gurnee police said at the time that they responded around 12:30 p.m. on October 24 to a call of an armed robbery. A man pulled into the drive-thru lane and robbed an employee.

The suspect displayed a handgun and took cash from the employee. No one was injured during the incident and officers identified the suspect vehicle as a stolen white Ford cargo van. The officers also determined the suspect was Eric J. Gatlin 43 of Elgin who was wanted on multiple warrants. Gatlin allegedly stole the Ford van just before the armed robbery from Goodwill in Round Lake Beach. A major police manhunt had ensued for Gatlin the day prior to the stolen vehicle and armed robbery.

Police officials said Gatlin had crashed a car into a tree in Grayslake and fled from police prompting that manhunt. Gatlin was taken into custody in Elgin two days after the Gurnee robbery. He was charged in Lake County with two counts of armed habitual criminal possession of a stolen firearm and two counts of felon in possession of a weapon. He remains held in the Cook County Jail on other charges and has not been transported back to Lake County yet.

He tattooed the date of the win—December 13 2013—on his arm in Roman numerals. His performance attracted the attention of the leadership of Borussia Dortmund a team in Germany’s Bundesliga. He became a star there before heading to Chelsea in 2019 in what was then the most expensive transfer of an American player in history. He has had spectacular moments at Chelsea and frustrations too but where his impact has really been felt is on the U.S. men’s national team. Following his success abroad there are now young Americans all over the top flights of the European leagues or just below them—Juventus Fulham Leeds Barcelona—to populate the U.S. team. Not just young they were fast and sometimes stylish. They seemed to like one another. Their coach Gregg Berhalter spoke of this World Cup as a trial before the real test in 2026 when the U.S. along with Mexico and Canada will host. But after making it out of the tournament’s first round—the thirty-two-team group stage—the American players spoke confidently. Why not them? Why not now?

Going into the second phase the knockout round of sixteen teams against the Netherlands they hadn’t given up a goal in the open field all tournament. But there was a problem and a harbinger: for all their aggression their high press their flurries of action the Americans had only scored two goals.

Pulisic wasn’t the secret to the team’s earlier successes—its best performances had come in the midfield—nor was he solely responsible for its failure to score more goals. But he had been dangerous and in the media and among fans he was frequently named the star. With his anodyne aspect and suburban-soccer roots he was nicknamed Captain America—enthusiastically by some and with an eye roll by others. He’d played well and was involved in both the team’s previous goals: against Wales he’d burst up the middle of the field and found a flying Tim Weah who scored. Against Iran he’d hurtled toward the goal—and the keeper—at just the moment that Sergiño Dest was heading a perfect cross. His foot batted the ball into the goal a half second before he crashed into the keeper and he sustained what was originally described as an abdominal injury and then a pelvic contusion but which appeared to viewers as something rather more severe. (“I didn’t like get hit in the balls” he explained later. He had badly bruised the hard bone above his balls.)

The question was how ready Pulisic would be to play against the Netherlands. It took less than three minutes to find out. He received a nice chip from Tyler Adams and took a shot saved by the long legs of the tall Dutch keeper. Had he struck the ball slightly more in stride and directed a few inches off he might have scored. There were other chances—crosses corners constant pressure. But ten minutes into the game the Netherlands spun things around and scored on a counterattack as Memphis Depay left open in the midfield during a long series of pretty passes scored easily. Then just as time ran out in the half Daley Blind a Dutch back slipped unmarked into the box and scored.

It wasn’t the end of the game for the U.S. though it seemed like it at the time. Berhalter subbed in Gio Reyna one of the best young players in the world for the second half and he had a few silky runs but they stalled out. Tim Ream got his foot on the ball right in front of the Netherlands’ goal but didn’t score. Haji Wright misplayed a first touch on a sublime chance—and then moments later smeared a cross from Pulisic off the ground that somehow spun like a spitball into the corner of the goal to put the U.S. on the board. But only minutes later the Dutch took advantage of another lapse to pad their lead 3–1.

Despite Saturday’s loss the tournament was in some respects an undeniable success for the U.S. The Americans didn’t just make it into the knockout stage but showed an exciting blueprint for the future—fast youthful cohesive fun to watch. Christian Pulisic wasn’t the only option anymore. He didn’t have to do it all. And yet what he did wasn’t enough. The Americans weren’t finishing their chances; there needed to be a better option for scoring; they lost their concentration on defense. Jesús Ferreira and Haji Wright the two strikers whom Berhalter deployed against the Netherlands struggled. To break into the world’s small group of élite teams the U.S. will need to maintain its coherence; it will also need to figure out how to finish. It was easy to imagine for the first few minutes of the game at least that this was the kind of tournament that could turn into a tattoo. Instead the U.S. is left with the indelible memory of unfinished opportunities and a picture that suggests something more. ♦",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0c2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL3NvY2Nlci93b3JsZC1jdXAvaGFzLXRoZS11cy1ldmVyLXdvbi1hLXdvcmxkLWN1cC8zMjIzODQv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjc3BvcnRzY2hpY2Fnby5jb20vc29jY2VyL3dvcmxkLWN1cC9oYXMtdGhlLXVzLWV2ZXItd29uLWEtd29ybGQtY3VwLzMyMjM4NC8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Has the US ever won a World Cup?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0c2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL3NvY2Nlci93b3JsZC1jdXAvaGFzLXRoZS11cy1ldmVyLXdvbi1hLXdvcmxkLWN1cC8zMjIzODQv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjc3BvcnRzY2hpY2Fnby5jb20vc29jY2VyL3dvcmxkLWN1cC9oYXMtdGhlLXVzLWV2ZXItd29uLWEtd29ybGQtY3VwLzMyMjM4NC8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C48FF2D720>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

In 1990 he became the first Black player born in the United States to represent the country in a World Cup game.

Never mind that the United States then returning to the World Cup after a four-decade hiatus was humbled by Czechoslovakia in a 5-1 loss. By starting as a defender for the Americans that June day in Italy Armstrong signaled that his home country could produce elite players who weren’t white.

Sadly with a few exceptions his trailblazing role did not get much attention in the press that day. Nor did it in the run-up to the tournament or when the American team played Italy to a near draw in group stage play days later. Another talented Black player Jimmy Banks also broke ground on the 1990 U.S. team subbing in for his initial action during the game against the Czechs. Banks’s part as a breaker of norms was similarly overlooked.

Color Armstrong unsurprised.

It was a disappointing end for a rebuilt U.S. team hoping to advance past the round of 16 for the first time since 2002. Using the second-youngest squad in the tournament the Americans achieved the bare minimum to consider the World Cup a success beating Iran in their group-stage finale to reach the knockout round.

But just like in 2010 against Ghana and 2014 against Belgium the United States was eliminated in the round of 16. While the Oranje extended their unbeaten streak to 19 games and advanced to a quarterfinal with Argentina the Americans contemplated how far they came and how short they fell.

""It hurts after a tough loss like that when we feel like we could have had more"" forward Christian Pulisic said after the game managing a voice only just above a whisper. ""We don't want to feel like this again.""

The Americans are winless in 12 games against European opponents at the World Cup since 2002 losing six and are 1-7 during the tournament's knockout rounds.

Captain Tyler Adams said ahead of Saturday's match the U.S. team was going to have to give it their all. They went into the game as underdogs — a role U.S. Soccer is used to men's national team defender Walker Zimmerman told CBS News on Friday.

""I think it's kind of what has made our team so special is the resiliency that we have that competitive spirit that every team before us has had"" he said.

Defensive lapses gave the Dutch a treat as Memphis Depay scored in the 10th minute and Daley Blind in first-half stoppage time.

U.S. hope revived when Pulisic's cross hit the trailing foot of second-half substitute Haji Wright and popped over goalkeeper Andries Noppert and into the net in the 76th. But Denzel Dumfries named after actor Denzel Washington scored on a volley in the 81st after assisting on the first two goals.

""The American public should be optimistic"" said Gregg Berhalter the first person to play for and coach the U.S. team at a World Cup. ""When you look at the way we wanted to play and did play it should be positive.""

The crowd of 44846 was well back from the field at renovated Khalifa International Stadium which has an athletics track and was more subdued than the raucous spectators for the match against Iran.

Pulisic playing four days after getting hurt during his game-winning goal against Iran had a chance to put the U.S. ahead in the third minute but Noppert playing in only his fourth international match blocked his point-blank shot.

""I thought I was way offside when it happened but I still hit it and he made a good save"" Pulisic said.

With the Americans seeking an equalizing goal Noppert dived to stop Tim Weah's 25-yard effort in the 42nd.

Following the loss the U.S. players didn't want to leave the field at first wanting more time together.

""Just putting perspective and reflecting on the journey"" defender DeAndre Yedlin said. ""Just giving thanks to the Earth. After every training and game we try to do a thing called grounding. It just helps put in perspective to come good or bad.""

Others absorbed the defeat without words.

""Just looking around that locker room the silence is deafening"" goalkeeper Matt Turner said. ""We all want to create moments for people back at home to fall in love with the game and tonight was not one of those nights unfortunately."""

These cell towers meet the requirements of television and radio broadcast corporations public safety networks and cellular carriers largely by providing mobile telecommunications connectivity and coverage.

As per statistics 60 percent of the 1.5 million sites held by the top 100 cellular towers companies in the world are operated by the ten largest owners and operators of cellular towers which include American Tower Indus Towers Summit Digitel Cellnex BSNL Tower edotco Vantage Towers Reliance Infratel Crown Castle and IHS Holding.

According to tower count Digital Infra gives a summary of the top 100 cellular tower companies globally. Then we delve further into the portfolios of each of the top 25 cell tower firms including the geographic distribution of their sites the number of tenants that install equipment on their towers and their primary clients. Please take note that this list does not include tower owners or operators from China or Russia.

A Cell Tower: What is it?

In order to enable the use of wireless communication devices like telephones and radios in the surrounding region electric communications equipment and antennae are put atop cell towers sometimes referred to as cell sites.

When a wireless carrier or tower firm expands the capacity or network coverage in a region they frequently build cell towers to improve signal reception. The United States is essentially covered in cell towers however certain cities have more than others. Since the late 1990s Millman Land has made sure that all of the cell towers have been thoroughly examined.

Currently the United States has more than 307000 cell towers. They occasionally appear on building roofs. Other times cities demand that cell towers perfectly fit into the urban environment. Sometimes they are concealed as trees in treescapes in rural places.

Cell tower audits surveys and as-builts are all part of our wireless services. We hope to educate you on cell towers and how they operate in this article. We also want to dispel the falsehoods and respond to people’s growing concerns about 5G.

How Do Cellular Towers Operate?

In the US there are more than 300 million daily cell phone users. When a mobile phone is in operation it emits an electromagnetic radio wave also known as a radio frequency which is picked up by the antenna of the closest cell tower.

This signal will be picked up by the cell tower which will then send it to a switching hub. This enables the call to connect to a phone network or to a different mobile phone. To assume that all of this occurs in a matter of seconds is absurd.

Cell tower components

Cell tower technology is incredibly quick thanks to its components. In this section we’ll talk a lot about cell carriers. This is so that several of a cell tower’s components also known as wireless networks or individual cell carriers can be used.

The best coverage for wireless networks in the US is provided by four different networks. Verizon is now the leading provider with a 70% 4G coverage rate. With 68% AT&T comes in second place. A significant reduction in coverage is seen between T-62% Mobile’s and Spring’s 27% in fourth place.

What Affects the Range of a Cell Tower?

A cell tower’s reach is not a set distance. That’s due to the number of different factors that might affect how far a cell tower can connect to a mobile device. The most typical variables are:

How high the antenna is in relation to the surroundings.

the signal’s frequency at use.

the transmitter’s rated power.

the site’s antenna array’s directional properties.

Radio waves are absorbed and reflected by the surrounding vegetation and buildings.

Weather conditions and regional geographic or regulatory variables.

High population densities are common places for the construction of the towers. This is so because there are the most prospective cell phone customers in these cities. Cell towers frequently “overlap” in highly populated regions as a result. By doing so interference issues are reduced.

If you’re wondering why you can’t get a signal on your cell phone it may be because you’re too distant from a tower or because hills big buildings or other structures have interfered with the signal. If many individuals are attempting to use the cell tower at once you can also lose your signal. That frequently results in dropped calls.

More and more cell towers will appear across the United States as technology develops. However there are still over 307000 cell towers across the country that make sure we have cell phone coverage practically wherever we go as we wait for 5G technology. The technology used to build these towers is amazing.

The Millman National Land Service makes sure that these cell towers not only adhere to health and safety regulations but also function as planned.

It was built in 1964 as part of Riverview Estates an 11-acre development that overlooks the Flats and downtown Cleveland.

Today about 498 senior citizens call Riverview Tower home. The 17-story apartment building is the largest single-standing residence operated by Ohio’s Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA).

Riverview Tower residents can now access high-speed internet courtesy of DigitalC a local nonprofit organization working to connect the unconnected in Cleveland. DigitalC delivers reliable affordable high-speed internet and collaborates with community partners to provide devices digital literacy training and tech support to Cleveland residents.

Katie Grootegoed director of strategic partnerships and empowerment at DigitalC says she has been surprised that senior citizens want to connect to the internet. “In the last few months since we got the Riverview building up and running with internet service we already have a 40 percent take rate in the building” she says. “We provide internet service as well as training skill building and devices.”

Jeff Patterson CEO of CMHA says it’s important for Riverview residents to be connected. “Having that many people connected at one site is amazing” he notes.

In Cleveland Ohio Riverview Tower is home to 498 senior citizen residents who now can access free high-speed internet thanks to DigitalC a nonprofit organization working with local community partners to connect unconnected residents in the city.

Narrowing the Divide

In Cleveland a lack of broadband connectivity is an unfortunate reality – especially in the area where Riverview Tower is located. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey Cleveland ranked last among U.S. cities with more than 100000 residents for broadband access. In addition the U.S. Census Bureau shows Cleveland ranks highest for the number of residents living in poverty (30.8 percent) including nearly half of the city’s children (46.1 percent).

Through its fixed wireless internet service provider unit EmpowerCLE+ DigitalC plans to provide affordable broadband service to Cleveland’s 34 neighborhoods. It intends to connect 40000 city households by 2024.

DigitalC’s project is a five-year public-private partnership with a $70 million budget. The organization raised more than $20 million from private donors and expects to rely on public sector funds for the remaining $50 million.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic EmpowerCLE+ has connected more than 1530 Cleveland households to its broadband service in the Central Fairfax Clark-Fulton Glenville Hough and Buckeye-Woodhill neighborhoods. DigitalC “has helped make Cleveland’s digital future equitable” Grootegoed says.

A Partnership Approach

Today DigitalC has about 1700 customers across Cleveland. Grootegoed says the customer reach is “due to our partnerships – both public and private – that are assisting in all aspects of helping us getting our customers signed up and getting our infrastructure in place.”

One DigitalC partner is Meta (formerly Facebook). As part of its effort to get more people connected to the internet the social media company is providing funding installation and delivery of fixed wireless internet services that will support more than 1000 households with low-cost high-speed internet.

Because of Meta’s investment EmpowerCLE+ high-speed internet service is now live and accessible to residents at CMHA properties including Addison Square Willson Tower Riverview Tower and Scranton Castle. As a result nearly 1100 public housing multiple-dwelling-unit (MDU) apartment buildings in Cleveland now have access to affordable high-speed internet.

“Meta is helping us bring broadband services to four low-income MDUs in the city” Grootegoed says. “We have worked to connect each building with an average 40 percent take rate which is remarkable.”

Besides Meta DigitalC works with other community partners to cover the costs of broadband subscriptions for low-income residents. The most DigitalC charges residents is $19.44 a month.

“All residents in Riverview Tower have fully subsidized internet paid for through Dollar Bank and MetroHealth [hospital system]” Grootegoed says. “This is because of our strong partnership so it’s a community effort.”

When CMHA started the process of getting its residents connected to the internet the initial concept was to give each building a computer lab. However Patterson says there were questions about how CMHA could get connectivity at each home within a building. Without in-home internet services residents could connect only when the computer labs were open.

“Being able to connect at home allows a parent to be more active in the child’s life and assist with homework” Patterson says. “Everybody does not work or study on the same clock. It gives people access when they’re available and fits their timelines.”

Focus on Seniors

The Riverview Tower development consists mainly of senior citizens a group that has shown a willingness and desire to learn digital skills and get connectivity. “We started skill-building classes and digital literacy training because the demand was so high” says Grootegoed. “Our biggest customer base is seniors not only for connectivity but also for training and upskilling.”

CMHA’s Patterson says that “many seniors want to connect and once they learn how to get online they connect with their children and grandchildren differently.” He notes that being online enables seniors to complete employment applications pay rent and do other everyday tasks. “People used to get general information by calling or looking in a newspaper but now having access to the internet puts valuable information right at their fingertips” he says. “People’s economic status should not dictate their ability to get that information.”

Driving Digital Literacy

As the nation’s seventh-largest housing authority CMHA has strong roots in the Cuyahoga County community. Today the agency oversees 10500 housing units and another 15600 housing choice voucher households. In all it serves 55000 people across the county.

The housing authority began to recognize a need for digital inclusion before 2016. At that time the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development implemented a plan under then-President Obama’s ConnectHomeUSA initiative to promote digital inclusion within public housing and states.

CMHA was one of 26 agencies to participate in a ConnectHomeUSA pilot project. “As we started that program we started to connect and develop partnerships with several nonprofit organizations” says Patterson. “One of those partners is DigitalC which has worked to provide access to residents at many different CMHA sites.” Patterson added that CMHA also works with “another nonprofit organization to provide training and equipment to residents at different sites.”

CMHA also saw the ways the pandemic highlighted the importance of having internet access and digital skills. “If the pandemic taught us anything it’s that there’s a strong need for digital inclusion and digital literacy training” Patterson says. “So many of the things people do now [online] are things that were not able to be done in person during the pandemic.”

Enabling Telehealth Everyday Applications

The new connectivity enables Riverview Tower residents to access various online applications that positively impact their daily lives. MetroHealth is helping provide training in using telehealth applications including scheduling appointments online checking medical records and communicating with doctors.

Grootegoed says providing a way for Riverview residents to speak to doctors online is crucial because getting to a facility is challenging for some. “Many residents are either immobile or have transportation issues so we’re trying to make sure the social determinants of health are being met and working to improve quality of life” she says.

Telehealth is only one of several applications that the DigitalC network will enable. Because many Riverview residents are Spanish speakers they face language barriers. Having affordable broadband service is key to supporting this population.

DigitalC is also working to give residents the ability to access everyday applications such as local transit and banking services in their preferred languages. The organization provides devices and teaches residents how to use them to access the resources they need including information about the building.

“CMHA has done a good job with newsletters and various electronic outreach campaigns” Grootegoed says. “Residents can also see their doctors online because we can bookmark [doctors’ contact information] for them on their devices. They know what the words mean because they are in their languages.”

In addition DigitalC can help residents easily navigate the public transportation system online and apply for benefits. “We download the Regional Transit Authority schedule for them so they are not waiting outside when [a bus] is not running” Grootegoed says. “They can now do that from their apartments instead of going all the way down to the bus stop.”

DigitalC is helping residents access telehealth local transit schedules and banking services in their preferred languages.

The United Arab Emirates is a personification of all things magnificent and larger-than-life. Dubai in particular has managed to create and hold records for having the tallest the most beautiful buildings and even the worlds largest observation wheel. Still sometimes even dazzling Dubai falls short of making ambitions come true. A case in point is Meydan City the $30 billion ambitious enterprise that’s left to rot as an abandoned city in Dubai. What could’ve been the crowning glory of the Middle East bit the dust in a span of six years with Meydan Real Estate all but becoming a mirage in the desert. However if it would have completed the city would have been nothing short of grand and in true Dubai style shattered a couple of world records. Take a tour of Meydan City which could have been the most excellent example of architecture luxury and technology-



Fantastic features of a $30 billion mega-city-

A vision of UAE’s prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum the $30 billion Meydan City would be home to no less than 80000 residents occupying 40 million square feet. The city would house the world’s most splendid residential tower a race track a vast ski resort and more.



The area’s highlight was Meydan One Mall a luxurious haven offering over 500 stores 100 restaurants hotels clubs a plaza IMAX and sky-bubble entertainment. This mall was to have something that no other mall has a humungous retractable roof that would measure 150 by 80 meters. Just to give you an idea the length of a football field is 105 meters (345 feet).



The key highlight of this magnanimous project was the 1.2 km long indoor ski slope. Undoubtedly it would have been the world’s largest and would be twice the length of AlpinCenter in Bottrop Germany which is the current record holder. At the base of the slope would sit a 25000-square-foot arena which would comfortably accommodate 8000 people and serve as a mix use space for concerts and sporting events.



Only Dubai can manage to fit in a freezing ski resort and a canal system like Venice as one of the modes of transportation in the marvelous Meydan City. The 4 km long (2.5 miles) canal would include shops luxury hotels restaurants and residences.



The residential tower was to stand tall at 2332 feet (Burj Khalifa stands tall at 2720 ft) with 885 luxurious private residences. If that’s not luxe enough there were plans for a five-star hotel with 350 rooms to impress the hedonistic visitors. The tower would also include the world’s highest restaurant which would treat guests to gourmet cuisines 675 meters above the ground. Meydan City was impressive from the word go and was to welcome guests to a world of opulence with a gigantic fountain that could shoot water up to 1250 feet in the air.



That’s higher than the Bank of America Tower in New York City and nearly equalling the Empire State Building. Also to put it in perspective the Bellagio fountains in Vegas shoot water upto a height of 460 feet only.



The impressive waterworks extend to a tremendous water park replete with attractions and amenities. Planned in 2013 the project finally commenced construction in 2015 with its first residential phase the Meydan Sobha. The first phase included an artificial lake complete with kayaks and paddle boats. For visitors to take a break from the heat a massive waterpark with two huge wave pools and multiple rides was on the cards. It was to also have a South Seas-inspired lagoon that would overlook the lagoon. One of the highlights of the park was to be a bungee jump that would dip guests into the crystal lagoon.



While most of the above remain plans the Meydan attracts thousands of visitors every year to the race course that opened in March 2020.



Why did Meydan City not see the light of day?

The Covid-19 pandemic wasn’t kind to anyone and this included Meydan Real Estate as well. In 2021 the company filed for bankruptcy leaving them with no funds and over $4 billion in debt. According to Bloomberg the company’s debts are tied to constructing a giant mall project that remains unfinished (in all probability the Meydan One Mall).



The company’s mounting problems and non-payment to contractors finally forced Dubai to set up a separate tribunal to hear all claims against the developer in 2019. While Dubai continues to glisten even without the splendid Meydan City it would’ve certainly been a great addition to the grandeur that Dubai offers.",,,

The U.S. government bankrolled the industry and mining companies rushed to profit building more than 50 mills and processing sites to refine uranium ore.

But the government didn’t have a plan for the toxic byproducts of this nuclear assembly line. Some of the more than 250 million tons of toxic and radioactive detritus known as tailings scattered into nearby communities some spilled into streams and some leaked into aquifers.

Congress finally created the agency that now oversees uranium mill waste cleanup in 1974 and enacted the law governing that process in 1978 but the industry would soon collapse due to falling uranium prices and rising safety concerns. Most mills closed by the mid-1980s.

When cleanup began federal regulators first focused on the most immediate public health threat radiation exposure. Agencies or companies completely covered waste at most mills to halt leaks of the carcinogenic gas radon and moved some waste by truck and train to impoundments specially designed to encapsulate it.

But the government has fallen down in addressing another lingering threat from the industry’s byproducts: widespread water pollution.

Regulators haven’t made a full accounting of whether they properly addressed groundwater contamination. So for the first time ProPublica cataloged cleanup efforts at the country’s 48 uranium mills seven related processing sites and numerous tailings piles.

At least 84% of the sites have polluted groundwater. And nearly 75% still have either no liner or only a partial liner between mill waste and the ground leaving them susceptible to leaking pollution into groundwater. In the arid West where most of the sites are located climate change is drying up surface water making underground reserves increasingly important.

ProPublica’s review of thousands of pages of government and corporate documents accompanied by interviews with 100 people also found that cleanup has been hampered by infighting among regulatory agencies and the frequency with which regulators grant exemptions to their own water quality standards.

The result: a long history of water pollution and sickness.

Reports by government agencies found high concentrations of cancer near a mill in Utah and elevated cancer risks from mill waste in New Mexico that can persist until cleanup is complete. Residents near those sites and others have seen so many cases of cancer and thyroid disease that they believe the mills and waste piles are to blame although epidemiological studies to prove such a link have rarely been done.

“The government didn’t pay attention up front and make sure it was done right. They just said ‘Go get uranium’” said Bill Dixon who spent decades cleaning up uranium and nuclear sites with the state of Oregon and in the private sector.

Tom Hanrahan grew up near uranium mills in Colorado and New Mexico and watched three of his three brothers contract cancer. He believes his siblings were “casualties” of the war effort.

“Somebody knew that this was a ticking atomic bomb” Hanrahan said. “But in military terms this was the cost of fighting a war.”

A Flawed System

When a uranium mill shuts down here is what’s supposed to happen: The company demolishes the buildings decontaminates the surrounding soil and water and encases the waste to stop it from leaking cancer-causing pollution. The company then asks the Nuclear Regulatory Commission the lead agency monitoring America’s radioactive infrastructure to approve the handoff of the property and its associated liability to the Department of Energy’s Office of Legacy Management for monitoring and maintenance.

ProPublica’s analysis found that half of the country’s former mills haven’t made it through this process and even many that did have never fully addressed pollution concerns. This is despite the federal government spending billions of dollars on cleanup in addition to the several hundred million dollars that have been spent by companies.

Often companies or agencies tasked with cleanup are unable to meet water quality standards so they request exemptions to bypass them. The NRC or state agencies almost always approve these requests allowing contaminants like uranium and selenium to be left in the groundwater. When ingested in high quantities those elements can cause cancer and damage the nervous system respectively.

The DOE estimates that some sites have individually polluted more than a billion gallons of water.

Bill Dam who spent decades regulating and researching uranium mill cleanup with the NRC at the DOE and in the private sector said water pollution won’t be controlled until all the waste and contaminated material is moved. “The federal government’s taken a Band-Aid approach to groundwater contamination” he said.

The pollution has disproportionately harmed Indian Country.

Six of the mills were built on reservations and another eight mills are within 5 miles of one some polluting aquifers used by tribes. And the country’s last conventional uranium mill still in operation — the White Mesa Mill in Utah — sits adjacent to a Ute Mountain Ute community.

So many uranium mines mills and waste piles pockmark the Navajo Nation that the Environmental Protection Agency created a comic book superhero Gamma Goat to warn Diné children away from the sites.

NRC staff acknowledged that the process of cleaning up America’s uranium mills can be slow but said that the agency prioritizes thoroughness over speed that each site’s groundwater conditions are complex and unique and that cleanup exemptions are granted only after gathering input from regulators and the public.

“The NRC’s actions provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection of public health and safety and the environment” David McIntyre an NRC spokesperson said in a statement to ProPublica.

“Cleanup Standards Might Suddenly Change”

For all the government’s success in demolishing mills and isolating waste aboveground regulators failed to protect groundwater.

Between 1958 and 1962 a mill near Gunnison Colorado churned through 540000 tons of ore. The process one step in concentrating the ore into weapons-grade uranium leaked uranium and manganese into groundwater and in 1990 regulators found that residents had been drawing that contaminated water from 22 wells.

The DOE moved the waste and connected residents to clean water. But pollution lingered in the aquifer beneath the growing town where some residents still get their water from private wells. The DOE finally devised a plan in 2000 which the NRC later approved settling on a strategy called “natural flushing” essentially waiting for groundwater to dilute the contamination until it reached safe levels.

In 2015 the agency acknowledged that the plan had failed. Sediments absorb and release uranium so waiting for contamination to be diluted doesn’t solve the problem said Dam the former NRC and DOE regulator.

In Wyoming state regulators wrote to the NRC in 2006 to lambast the agency’s “inadequate” analysis of natural flushing compared to other cleanup options. “Unfortunately the citizens of Wyoming may likely have to deal with both the consequences and the indirect costs of the NRC’s decisions for generations to come” the state’s letter said.

ProPublica identified mills in six states — including eight former mill sites in Colorado — where regulators greenlit the strategy as part of a cleanup plan.

When neither water treatment nor nature solves the problem federal and state regulators can simply relax their water quality standards allowing harmful levels of pollutants to be left in aquifers.

County officials made a small area near the Gunnison mill off-limits to new wells and the DOE suggested changing water quality standards to allow uranium concentrations as much as 475 times what naturally occurred in the area. It wouldn’t endanger human health the agency said because people wouldn’t come into contact with the water.

ProPublica found that regulators granted groundwater cleanup exemptions at 18 of the 28 sites where cleanup has been deemed complete and liability has been handed over to the DOE’s Office of Legacy Management. Across all former uranium mills the NRC or state agencies granted at least 34 requests for water quality exemptions while denying as few as three.

“They’re cutting standards so we’re getting weak cleanup that future generations may not find acceptable” said Paul Robinson who spent four decades researching the cleanup of the uranium industry with the Southwest Research and Information Center an Albuquerque-based nonprofit. “These great mining companies of the world they got away cheap.”

NRC staffers examine studies that are submitted by companies’ consultants and other agencies to show how cleanup plans will adequately address water contamination. Some companies change their approach in response to feedback from regulators and the public can view parts of the process in open meetings. Still the data and groundwater modeling that underpin these requests for water cleanup exemptions are often wrong.

One reason: When mining companies built the mills they rarely sampled groundwater to determine how much contamination occurred naturally leaving it open to debate how clean groundwater should be when the companies leave according to Roberta Hoy a former uranium program specialist with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. She said federal regulators also haven’t done enough to understand certain contaminants at uranium mills.

In one recent case the NRC fined a mining company $14500 for incomplete and inaccurate groundwater modeling data. Companies use such data to prove that pollution won’t spread in the future. Freeport-McMoRan the corporation that owns the fined mining company did not respond to a request for comment.

At a 2013 conference co-hosted by the NRC and a mining trade group a presentation from two consultants compared groundwater modeling to a sorcerer peering at a crystal ball.

ProPublica identified at least seven sites where regulators granted cleanup exemptions based on incorrect groundwater modeling. At these sites uranium lead nitrates radium and other substances were found at levels higher than models had predicted and regulators had allowed.

McIntyre the NRC spokesperson said that groundwater models “inherently include uncertainty” and the government typically requires sites to be monitored. “The NRC requires conservatism in the review process and groundwater monitoring to verify a model’s accuracy” he said.

Water quality standards impose specific limits on the allowable concentration of contaminants — for example the number of micrograms of uranium per liter of water. But ProPublica found that the NRC granted exemptions in at least five states that were so vague they didn’t even include numbers and were instead labeled as “narrative.” The agency justified this by saying the groundwater was not near towns or was naturally unfit for human consumption.

This system worries residents of Cañon City Colorado. Emily Tracy who serves on the City Council has lived a few miles from the area’s now-demolished uranium mill since the late 1970s and remembers floods and winds carrying mill waste into neighborhoods from the 15.3-million-ton pile which is now partially covered.

Uranium and other contaminants had for decades tainted private wells that some residents used for drinking water and agriculture according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The company that operated the mill Cotter Corp. finally connected residents to clean water by the early 1990s and completed cleanup work such as decontaminating soil after the EPA got involved. But the site remains without a final cleanup plan — which the company that now owns the site is drafting — and the state has eased water quality standards for molybdenum a metal that uranium mining and milling releases into the environment.

“We have great concerns about what it might look like or whether cleanup standards might suddenly change before our eyes” Tracy said.

Jim Harrington managing director of the site’s current owner Colorado Legacy Land said that a final cleanup strategy has not been selected and that any proposal would need to be approved by both the EPA and the state.

Layers of Regulation

It typically takes 35 years from the day a mill shuts down until the NRC approves or estimates it will approve cleanup as being complete ProPublica found. Two former mills aren’t expected to finish this process until 2047.

Chad Smith a DOE spokesperson said mills that were previously transferred to the government have polluted groundwater more than expected so regulators are more cautious now.

The involvement of so many regulators can also slow cleanup.

Five sites were so contaminated that the EPA stepped in via its Superfund program which aims to clean up the most polluted places in the country.

At the Homestake mill in New Mexico where cleanup is jointly overseen by the NRC and the EPA Larry Camper a now-retired NRC division director acknowledged in a 2011 meeting “that having multiple regulators for the site is not good government” and had complicated the cleanup according to meeting minutes.

ProPublica Read More A Uranium Ghost Town in the Making

Homestake Mining Company of California did not comment on Camper’s view of the process.

Only one site where the EPA is involved in cleanup has been successfully handed off to the DOE and even there uranium may still persist above regulatory limits in groundwater and surface water according to the agency. An EPA spokesperson said the agency has requested additional safety studies at that site.

“A lot of people make money in the bureaucratic system just pontificating over these things” said William Turner a geologist who at different times has worked for mining companies for the U.S. Geological Survey and as the New Mexico Natural Resources Trustee.

If the waste is on tribal land it adds another layer of government.

The federal government and the Navajo Nation have long argued over the source of some groundwater contamination at the former Navajo Mill built by Kerr-McGee Corp. in Shiprock New Mexico with the tribe pointing to the mill as the key source. Smith of the DOE said the department is guided by water monitoring results “to minimize opportunities for disagreement.”

Tronox which acquired parts of Kerr-McGee did not respond to requests for comment.

All the while 2.5 million tons of waste sit adjacent to the San Juan River in the town of 8000 people. Monitoring wells situated between the unlined waste pile and the river have shown nitrate levels as high as 80 times the limit set by regulators to protect human health uranium levels 30 times the limit and selenium levels 20 times the limit.

“I can’t seem to get the federal agencies to acknowledge the positions of the Navajo Nation” said Dariel Yazzie who formerly managed the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund Program.

At some sites overlapping jurisdictions mean even less cleanup gets done.

Such was the case near Griffin North Dakota where six cows and 2500 sheep died in 1973; their bodies emitted a blue glow in the morning light. The animals lay near kilns that once served as rudimentary uranium mills operated by Kerr-McGee. To isolate the element piles of uranium-laden coal at the kilns were “covered with old tires doused in diesel fuel ignited and left to smolder for a couple of months” according to the North Dakota Geological Survey.

The flock is believed to have been poisoned by land contaminated with high levels of molybdenum. The danger extended beyond livestock. In a 1989 draft environmental assessment the DOE found that “fatal cancer from exposure to residual radioactive materials” from the Griffin kilns and another site less than a mile from a town of 1000 people called Belfield was eight times as high as it would have been if the sites had been decontaminated.

But after agreeing to work with the federal government North Dakota did an about-face. State officials balked at a requirement to pay 10% of the cleanup cost — the federal government would cover the rest — and in 1995 asked that the sites no longer be regulated under the federal law. The DOE had already issued a report that said doing nothing “would not be consistent” with the law but the department approved the state’s request and walked away saying it could only clean a site if the state paid its share.

“North Dakota determined there was minimal risk to public health at that time and disturbing the grounds further would create a potential for increased public health risk” said David Stradinger manager of the Radiation Control Program in the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. Contaminated equipment was removed and the state is reevaluating one of the sites he said.

“A Problem for the Better Part of 50 Years”

While the process for cleaning up former mills is lengthy and laid out in regulations regulators and corporations have made questionable and contradictory decisions in their handling of toxic waste and tainted water.

More than 40 million people rely on drinking water from the Colorado River but the NRC and DOE allowed companies to leak contamination from mill waste directly into the river arguing that the waterway quickly dilutes it.

Federal regulators relocated tailings at two former mills that processed uranium and vanadium another heavy metal on the banks of the Colorado River in Rifle Colorado because radiation levels there were deemed too high. Yet they left some waste at one former processing site in a shallow aquifer connected to the river and granted an exemption that allowed cleanup to end and uranium to continue leaking into the waterway.

For a former mill built by the Anaconda Copper Company in Bluewater New Mexico the NRC approved the company’s request to hand the site off to the DOE in 1997. About a decade later the state raised concerns about uranium that had spread several miles in an aquifer that provides drinking water for more than 15000 people.

The contamination hasn’t reached the wells used by nearby communities and Smith the DOE spokesperson said the department has no plans to treat the uranium in the aquifer. It’s too late for much more cleanup since the DOE’s Office of Legacy Management’s mission is to monitor and maintain decommissioned sites not clean them. Flawed cleanup efforts caused problems at several former mills after they were handed off to the agency according to a 2020 Government Accountability Office report.

“Uranium has been overplayed as a boom” said Travis Stills an environmental attorney in Colorado who has sued over the cleanup of old uranium infrastructure. “The boom was a firecracker and it left a problem for the better part of 50 years now.”

“No Way in Hell We’re Going to Leave This Stuff Here”

Mining companies can’t remove every atom of uranium from groundwater experts said but they can do a better job of decommissioning uranium mills. With the federal government yet to take control of half the country’s former mills regulators still have time to compel some companies to do more cleanup.

Between 1958 and 1961 the Lakeview Mining Company generated 736000 tons of tailings at a uranium mill in southern Oregon. Like at most sites uranium and other pollution leaked into an aquifer.

“There’s no way in hell we’re going to leave this stuff here” Dixon the nuclear cleanup specialist remembered thinking. He represented the state of Oregon at the former mill which was one of the first sites to relocate its waste to a specially engineered disposal cell.

A local advisory committee at the Lakeview site allowed residents and local politicians to offer input to federal regulators. By the end of the process the government had paid to connect residents to a clean drinking water system and the waste was moved away from the town where it was contained by a 2-foot-thick clay liner and covered with 3 feet of rocks soil and vegetation. Local labor got priority for cleanup contracts and a 170-acre solar farm now stands on the former mill site.

But relocation isn’t required. At some sites companies and regulators saw a big price tag and either moved residents away or merely left the waste where it was.

“I recognize Lakeview is easy and it’s a drop in the bucket compared to New Mexico” Dixon said referring to the nation’s largest waste piles. “But it’s just so sad to see that this hasn’t been taken care of.”

Methodology

To investigate the cleanup of America’s uranium mills ProPublica assembled a list of uranium processing and disposal sites from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s most recent “Status of the Decommissioning Program” annual report the WISE Uranium Project and several federal agencies’ websites. Reporters reviewed fact sheets from the NRC and the Department of Energy before studying the history of each mill contained in thousands of pages of documents that are archived mainly in the NRC’s Agencywide Documents Access and Management System known as ADAMS. We solicited feedback on our findings from 10 experts who worked or work at the NRC the Environmental Protection Agency the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality the Southwest Research and Information Center the University of New Mexico and elsewhere. Additionally we interviewed dozens of current and former regulators residents of communities adjacent to mills representatives of tribes academics politicians and activists to better understand the positive and negative impacts of the uranium industry and the bureaucracy that oversees uranium mill cleanup. We also traveled to observe mill sites in New Mexico Utah and Colorado.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjIvZGVjLzA0L2plcnJlLXZhbi1ob29zZS0yMDIyLTEyLTA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jerre Max Van Hoose Obituary,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjIvZGVjLzA0L2plcnJlLXZhbi1ob29zZS0yMDIyLTEyLTA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C4929548B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

His default setting is offense.

On the day last week that an order was made public detailing the takeover by the U.S. Department of Justice of the Jackson Water System the governor went to social media to proclaim victory. But it was not clear who was keeping score other than Reeves.

“It is excellent news for anyone who cares about the people of Jackson that the mayor (Chokwe Antar Lumumba) will no longer be overseeing the city’s water system” the governor said on social media. “It is out of the city’s control and will now be overseen by a federal court.”

The beleaguered water system which has been beset for years with boil water notices and the loss of water pressure also is out of the control of the state of Mississippi. And of course the state of Mississippi is ultimately the responsibility of Gov. Jonathan Tate Reeves.

Make no mistake about it – President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice is taking over the Jackson water system because both the city of Jackson and the state of Mississippi have been unable or unwilling to fix it.

Perhaps the governor should send Biden whom he often goes on offense against a thank you note for taking over the problem. After all the governor made it clear he did not want to deal with the problem.

“It is a great day to be in Hattiesburg. It’s also as always a great day to not be in Jackson” Reeves joked during the height of the most recent shutdown when many city residents had no running water. “I feel like I should take off my emergency manager director hat and leave it in the car and take off my public works director hat and leave it in the car.”

Granted as the governor and other state officials have often said it is primarily the responsibility of the city to provide adequate water to the citizens of Jackson.

But ultimately Jackson like any municipality in Mississippi is a creature of the state. All municipalities in the state from Satartia in Yazoo County with less than 50 residents to Jackson the capital city with about 150000 residents were created by acts of the Mississippi Legislature.

The Mississippi Constitution reads “The Legislature shall pass general laws … under which cities and towns may be chartered and their charters amended.”

Reeves during his eight years as lieutenant governor presiding over the Senate or during his three years as governor could have advocated for legislation to deal with the Jackson water crisis that has been ongoing for years. The water crisis should not be a surprise to anyone in state government. More than once Jackson water woes resulted in portable bathrooms being parked on the grounds of the ornate Mississippi Capitol during sessions of the Legislature.

The governor and Legislature could have acted to deal with the water woes with or without the consent of officials with the city of Jackson. After all the city as established by the Mississippi Constitution is a creature of the state.

And it is not as if state officials have an aversion to getting involved in the business other than water of the city of Jackson.

It was not that long ago – 2016 – that legislation originating in the Senate where Reeves presided at the time as lieutenant governor was passed and signed into law by then-Gov. Phil Bryant stripping from city officials some of the authority over the Jackson Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport. Granted a federal lawsuit has been filed that is pending trying to block the legislation from being enacted.

But that does not diminish the fact that there were steps the state could have taken earlier to deal with the issues facing the Jackson Water System.

There are multiple other examples of the governor and the Legislature meddling in the business of Jackson and of other cities across the state. Almost on a yearly basis legislation is considered and sometimes passed to limit the cities’ authority to enact gun safety laws or to limit the cities’ authority to deal with undocumented immigrants as the locally elected leaders see fit.

Does saying all of this mean that there is not blame going way back among Jackson officials for the condition of the city water system?

The answer to that question most likely is no but with the caveat that people in the highest echelons of state government who live in glass houses perhaps should not throw stones.

AMG 133 is a bispecific molecule that addresses two targets GLP-1 and GIPR and in a phase 1 study achieved clinically significant body weight reductions over 12 weeks in people with obesity and without diabetes according to Amgen.

The drug was given as a subcutaneous injection every four weeks in the study and showed a clear dose response with a 7.2% weight loss in the lowest dose group (140 mg) rising to 14.5% in those getting a 420 mg dose.

According to Amgen the weight loss was maintained after the end of the study period pointing to a durable effect although it tailed off to an 11% reduction after around 21 weeks.

Amgen will now move ahead with a phase 2 programme for AMG 133 as it tries to enter a weight-loss category that has been transformed by the approval of Novo Nordisk’s once-weekly GLP-1 agonist Wegovy (semaglutide) which the company reckons will drive its obesity sales to $3.7 billion in 2025 once initial manufacturing problems are resolved.

The market looks set to have a new entrant shortly with Lilly’s dual GLP-1/GIP targeting drug tirzepatide which is already approved for diabetes as Mounjaro and heading for an FDA filing in obesity next year after the readout of a second phase 3 trial due in April.

Unlike tirzepatide which stimulates both GLP-1 and GIP AMG 133 acts as an agonist of the former but downgrades the activity of the latter. It remains to be seen if that approach is better.

Like Wegovy tirzepatide is also dosed weekly so AMG 133 could provide an option that requires fewer injections if its once-monthly dosing frequency is backed up in further studies. Lilly is also planning to look at longer intervals between dosing in its phase 2 programme.

While it is hard to make judgments about efficacy with such limited data the 14.5% reduction seen with AMG 133 is in the same ballpark as the reductions seen with Wegovy and tirzepatide in trials.

“AMG 133 was designed based on preclinical and human genetic data that strongly suggest GIPR inhibition as a strategy for weight loss especially in combination with GLP-1 agonism” said Amgen’s head of R&D David Reese in a statement.

“We are encouraged by these phase 1 results with once-monthly dosing of AMG 133 specifically the degree rate and durability of the weight loss” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWdlbi1zYXlzLWV4cGVyaW1lbnRhbC1vYmVzaXR5LWRydWctMjMzMjE2NDA5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amgen says experimental obesity drug has promising durability,"By Deena Beasley

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amgen Inc's experimental obesity drug demonstrated promising durability trends in an early trial paving the way for a larger mid-stage study early next year company officials said ahead of a data presentation on Saturday.

The small Phase I trial found that patients maintained their weight loss for 70 days after receiving the highest tested dose of the injected drug currently known as AMG133.

Amgen shares have gained about 5% since the company said on Nov. 7 that 12 weeks of trial treatment at the highest monthly dose of AMG133 resulted in mean weight loss of 14.5%.

At 150 days after the last dose maintained weight loss had dropped to 11.2% below original weight at the start of the trial according to findings detailed at a meeting of World Congress of Insulin Resistance Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease in Los Angeles.

Patients treated with AMG133 did have side effects including nausea and vomiting but most cases were mild and resolved within a couple of days after the first dose Amgen said.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more that 40% of the U.S. population is obese costing nearly $173 billion annually. It is a primary cause of type 2 diabetes and been linked to heart disease certain cancers and other health complications such as more severe COVID-19.

The weight loss field has gained renewed medical and investor attention in recent months after diabetes drugs from Eli Lilly and Co and Novo Nordisk known as semaglutide and tirzepatide were proven to help obese patients lose weight.

Both of those drugs which need to be injected every two weeks are designed to activate GLP-1 a hormone that triggers the feeling of fullness in the body after eating.

Amgen's AMG133 also targets GLP-1 but has a dual mechanism which aims at the same time to block activity of a gene known as GIP.

The drug was developed from work at Amgen to identify genetic signals associated with lower fat mass and body weight and also healthy metabolic profiles explained Saptarsi Haldar head of cardiovascular metabolic discovery at Amgen.

""Genetics clearly showed in multiple large populations that decreased activity genetically of the GIP receptor gene was associated with lower BMI (body mass index)"" he said.

The California-based biotech said it plans to launch a larger mid-stage study of AMG133 early next year which will enroll a broader range of patients including those with additional health conditions such as diabetes.

JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott earlier this month said that if all goes well a Phase III study of AMG133 could begin in 2024 with a launch expected in 2026 or 2027 if approved.

These new drugs can reduce weight up to 20% though doctors caution that not everyone will benefit.

Analysts estimate the weight loss medication field could generate $50 billion annually by 2030.

A new generation of anti-obesity medications offers the promise of dramatic weight loss but there is still a long way to go to make them accessible to those who need them.

Obesity is the last major untapped medical condition – one that more than 100 million Americans share – and drug companies have been trying for decades to develop a treatment.

Finally medications are coming on the market with the promise of reducing weight by 15% to more than 20% more than has ever been possible with medications and the kind of weight loss rarely seen outside of surgery.

But so far only the wealthiest and luckiest have been able to access the first of a new class of medications. That drug Wegovy sells for $1349 for four weekly shots per month.",,,

This company is engaged in the modernization of combat armored vehicles tanks and heavy artillery. According to Ukrainian sources Excalibur Army has increased its personnel by 150 people mostly Ukrainians.

Excalibur Army is preparing delivery to Ukraine in the coming weeks of 90 tanks. Literally says a Ukrainian source tanks are collected from all over the world and very often they are simply built from scratch. The reason is that over the years these tanks have not been maintained they have been standing in the open and they have often become the object of “cannibalism” – they are used for spare parts.

All this complicates the rapid delivery of tanks to Ukraine. The Ukrainian site mil.in.ua says that work on one such tank takes from several weeks to several months.

What is being upgraded on tanks?

In modern warfare the first thing to do is to eliminate analog devices and systems. They have been there since the Cold War era developed to meet the requirements of the time. Thanks to stocks as well as supplies from partners of Ukraine Excalibur Army installs renews or simply cleans night vision devices thermal imaging cameras communication systems and automation that facilitates management.

Video screenshot

New dynamic protection blocks are being placed as well. It is these rectangular boxes on the armor that are supposed to minimize the effect of an anti-tank gun so that the armor does not suffer major damage the crew remains alive and the tank continues to function.

Funding

Excalibur army has a complete list of what it upgrades on tanks. These repairs are being financed by the US and the Netherlands which announced this back in November. The two countries divide the funding separately – 45 units per country.

According to preliminary calculations regarding the modernization process one part of the tanks Ukraine will receive by the end of 2022. The rest in 2023.

Deion Sanders just took over as head coach at Colorado and he appears to already have his starting quarterback for the 2023 season.

At his introductory press conference after being named to the position Sanders indicated his son Shedeur will join him in Boulder Colorado and suit up for the Buffaloes.

Chris Hummer of 247Sports noted Shedeur Sanders hasn't officially entered the transfer portal which opens Monday but that his transfer from Jackson State is considered a foregone conclusion.

Shedeur has thrown for 3383 yards and 36 touchdowns while running for 174 yards and five touchdowns this season. It's unclear whether he intends to play in the Celebration Bowl on Dec. 17 which pits Jackson State against North Carolina Central.

His transfer could have a domino effect for Colorado's quarterback situation.

J.T. Shrout who transferred from Tennessee in 2021 just finished up his first year under center for the Buffaloes. With 1220 yards and seven touchdowns he was the team's leading passer.

Sanders' imminent arrival might have Shrout evaluating all of his transfer options.

True freshman Owen McCown already announced his intention to enter the portal and there's seemingly no chance he'll walk back that decision now. McCown finished with 600 yards two touchdowns and two interceptions in his four appearances in 2022.

Sunday's press conference illustrated how Coach Prime intends to hit the ground running.

Colorado which has five 10-loss seasons since 2006 is a massive rebuilding project. In the era of NIL and the one-time transfer rule a program can be rejuvenated with just one offseason. And that's what the Buffaloes intend to do with Sanders.

There may not be a program that hits the transfer portal harder than Colorado and it has a coach who can potentially bring elite talent to Boulder.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXJlbGxpb3R0LzIwMjIvMTIvMDQvcHJvLWFkdmljZS1mb3ItYnV5aW5nLXRyYXZlbC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtaW4tMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pro Advice For Buying Travel Insurance In 2023,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2022/12/04/pro-advice-for-buying-travel-insurance-in-2023/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXJlbGxpb3R0LzIwMjIvMTIvMDQvcHJvLWFkdmljZS1mb3ItYnV5aW5nLXRyYXZlbC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtaW4tMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBodWtldG5ld3MuY29tL3Jvbi1ib3dscy1vdmVyLXRoZS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1hdC10aGUta2FtYWxhLWxhd24tYm93bHMtY2x1Yi1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtODY0NDQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ron bowls over the competition at the Kamala Lawn Bowls Club Championship,"Ron bowls over the competition at the Kamala Lawn Bowls Club Championship

BOWLS: A bumper field of 24 bowlers took part in the Kamala Lawn Bowls Club Championship on Friday (Dec 2) the first “major” tournament of the year.

Bowls

By Robert Knight

Sunday 4 December 2022 01:17 PM

With high season upon us and COVID restrictions on travel finally lifted many previously exiled bowlers returned to action at the Kamala Bowls Club including some previous champions.

With the unseasonal heavy rains having abated some were hoping for speedier green conditions but those hopes were dashed by heavy overnight rain meaning pretty slow conditions.

With 24 bowlers in the field a first round “scroungers” triples format was necessary in order to reduce the field to 8 quarter-finalists.

For this competition a move was made away from the traditional out-of-the-hat draw and previous winners of competitions were seeded as a trial. The seeds were selected on recent club form and success records in past major championships a contentious decision that was questioned by some.

Progressing through to the last 8 were 4 of the seeded players: Ron Blackwood Glenn Collins Ulf (Ue) Egerstaad and Dean Lambert.

Meanwhile Ulf ""The Detective"" Larsson Carl Mesham Dot Barker and Aon Sunnee (the current Phuket Open Champion who was surprisingly unseeded) knocked out the other 4 seeded players. This early elimination of 4 of the seeds reflected the strength in depth of the whole field of 24 competitors.

Two of the quarter-finals were one sided affairs with Ulf “The Detective” dispatching Glenn and Aon comprehensively outplaying Ue.

Tighter affairs occurred in the other two games with Ron beating Dean 5-2 and Dot sneaking past Carl 7-6 after a sudden death extra end.

This meant the only remaining seed in the semi-finals was two- time defending Club Champion Ron Blackwood who was looking for an unprecedented hat-trick against Ulf “The Detective”.

The other semi-final was an all female affair between Aon and Dot an impressive feat considering there were only 5 female players from the original total of 24.

Ulf “The Detective” went into his match against Ron short of competitive action and practice having only recently arrived back on the island and it showed as the latter ran out a comfortable winner 11-4 with one end to spare.

In the ladies match it was a tense affair going to the final end before Aon prevailed 7-5. Similar to Ulf “The Detective” Dot had only recently returned to Phuket and was lacking match practice while Aon had enjoyed recent match experience which may have been a contributory factor to the result.

The final was now set between two reigning champions with perfect conditions as the green had sped up considerably in the heat - the jury was open as to who was favourite to emerge victorious.

Aon surged into an early 4-0 lead and it seemed the writing was on the wall for Ron although he then managed to score a maximum 4-pointer on end number 4 to take the lead. As with quite a few bowlers throughout the tournament Aon mistakenly failed to mitigate the damage on an opponent’s end to a lesser count.

Ron took the next 3 ends to surge ahead 7-4 but Aon came storming back with a brilliant score of 3 meaning after 7 ends the score was level at 7-7 with all to play for.

It must be noted that Ron’s beverage count for the day also on 7 although it was suspected the beverage in question wasn’t a 7-Up!

Ron fought back with a 3-pointer on end 8 but with Aon scoring a point on end 9 heading into the final end it was 10-8 to Ron.

As the final end got underway thunder and lightning were seen and heard in the distance leaving the watching crowd wondering if it was perhaps an omen and would Aon produce a storming finish.

However it was not to be as Ron held his nerve and claimed the final end by 1 shot to emerge victorious with a final score of 11-8.

In doing so Ron became the first ever bowler to win any championship at the club three times in succession. A new phrase was thus created as he declared it not a “three-peat” but a “three-Ron!”

Meanwhile in the “Plate” competition for those that were eliminated in the first round tournament organiser Ken “Sammy” Sampert beat Per Alhm 7-4 meaning a clean sweep of the trophies for Canada for the first time.

All in all it was a great day of bowling played in a superbly sporting manner and it was great to be back out on the green again. Kudos to Sammy for organising and running the event.

However the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

Recent earnings growth for Apple has been in line with the market. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this modest earnings performance will accelerate. If not then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.

See our latest analysis for Apple

pe

Keen to find out how analysts think Apple's future stacks up against the industry? In that case our free report is a great place to start.

Does Growth Match The High P/E?

In order to justify its P/E ratio Apple would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.

If we review the last year of earnings growth the company posted a worthy increase of 8.7%. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 110% in total over the last three years. Therefore it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.

Shifting to the future estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 5.4% per annum over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.1% growth each year the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.

In light of this it's alarming that Apple's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.

The Bottom Line On Apple's P/E

Generally our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.

We've established that Apple currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.

AMAT,Applied Materials,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzAzL3doeS1hc21sLWFwcGxpZWQtbWF0ZXJpYWxzLWFuZC1sYW0tcmVzZWFyY2gtcmFsbGllL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why ASML Applied Materials and Lam Research Rallied in November,"It was a good month for semiconductor equipment stocks amid analyst days earnings releases and Warren Buffett buying into the sector.

What happened

Shares of semiconductor equipment stocks ASML Holdings (ASML 1.83%) Applied Materials (AMAT 1.65%) and Lam Research (LRCX 0.87%) rallied in November rising 17.4% 24.1% and 16.7% respectively.

There were several reasons for the across-the-board strength. First semiconductor stocks had already sold off hard this year through September as rising interest rates and recession fears caused a huge decline in semis after they recorded a very strong 2021.

But on Nov. 10 a lighter-than-expected inflation report lit a fire under virtually all beaten-down tech stocks as moderating inflation spurred hope the Fed may slow its interest rate hikes going forward.

In addition ASML held its 2022 Investor Day at which it raised its long-term growth outlook despite a soft market this year. Applied Materials then released its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report which also showed surprising strength despite a softening semi market. Lam Research had already released its third-quarter earnings in late October but rode ASML's and Applied Materials' coattails to above-market gains.

Oh and Warren Buffett also bought into the sector buying the stock of these companies' biggest foundry customer.

So what

At its November Investor Day ASML raised its 2025 outlook about 30% above the figures it had projected as recently as its 2021 Investor Day and guided for continued growth to 2030. The increased long-term guidance is especially reassuring since it appears the semiconductor industry is heading into a downcycle this year.

ASML cited a brighter outlook for artificial intelligence and edge computing data centers as well as the metaverse which just emerged as a big concept a year ago. Furthermore ASML highlighted technology sovereignty such as the passing of the CHIPS Act this past summer as potentially leading to a 10% incremental increase in foundry investments -- and therefore semiconductor machine purchases -- by 2030.

That long-term projection gave a jolt not only to ASML but also to Applied Materials and Lam Research whose etch and deposition machines must be used in conjunction with ASML's lithography machines to produce leading-edge chips.

Applied Materials then followed up ASML's optimism with a better-than-expected earnings report and forecast. There was a lot of hand-wringing coming into Applied's report as the memory industry had gone into a big downturn and new regulations regarding chip sales to China from the Biden administration announced in October had caused Applied to revise down its earnings projections last month.

However when Applied wound up reporting its adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share (EPS) actually came within its original guidance range and well above its October revisions at $2.03 up 5% year over year. And despite the China regulations kicking in for a full quarter Applied guided for $6.7 billion in revenue plus or minus $400 million and EPS between $1.75 and $2.11 for the January quarter -- about flat quarter over quarter.

Given all the headwinds in the semiconductor industry and Applied's history of conservative guidance the flat guidance was enough to satisfy fearful investors that had sold off the stock to bargain-level valuations in October.

Finally all semis likely got a jolt of confidence after Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a large stake in the world's largest foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. TSMC is a huge buyer of ASML Applied and Lam Research machines so a vote of confidence in TSMC is also a vote of confidence in these three companies by association.

Now what

Semiconductor stocks have been known to be cyclical and we seem to be entering some sort of downturn in the second half of 2022. However surprising strength from ASML Applied and even Lam last month could indicate that investment in semiconductor production may be a bit more consistent than the end sales of actual chips themselves.

The full effect of the chip downturn will likely be felt in the first half of next year so these three names are not out of the woods just yet. However if they can get through this downturn without too much of a hit to revenue and earnings there is the chance these three stocks may shed some of their cyclical reputation and garner a higher multiple coming out of this downcycle. Still that has yet to be proven out even after last month's strong numbers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy95dXRhLXdhdGFuYWJlLXRpbWUtdGhvdWdodC1taWdodC0xODAyNDMyODAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yuta Watanabe: 'There was a time I thought I might not belong to this league',"Brooklyn Nets forward Yuta Watanabe began training camp on the roster bubble and improbably became the league’s top three-point shooter at 57.1 percent and is shooting an elite 60.9 percent from the field overall to this point.

Watanabe sat down with HoopsHype in Brooklyn’s locker room to open up about his journey to get to this point and rapid rise to notoriety. He discussed the pressure of representing Japan with Rui Hachimura as the only two players from their country and changing the narrative surrounding Asian basketball stereotypes. The Japanese forward also explained how Kevin Durant helped him improve as a shooter his long-term future and more in our interview.

What does it mean to represent Japan with Rui Hachimura as the only two Japanese NBA players?

Patrick Smith-Getty Images

Yuta Watanabe: I think it’s really important for us to represent our country. When I was growing up and I said I wanted to be an NBA player people were like “Only one Japanese guy made it to the league so it’s almost impossible. You can’t do that.” I wanted to change those people’s perceptions. I wanted to change how they thought about themselves and the Japanese. I think more people started watching the NBA. I hope a lot of kids right now are starting to dream of being an NBA player.

If I told you that you’d lead the NBA three-point percentage what would you have said and how have you done it so far?

YW: It’s crazy. I’ve always known I could shoot but 57 percent? That’s impossible. I’m not expecting myself to keep up that number but I’m going to keep shooting with confidence. The reason I’m shooting well is because of KD (Kevin Durant) Ben (Simmons) and Kyrie (Irving). I’m playing with those greats. They get doubled all the time so I’m always open and my job is to make those wide-open shots.

What advice has Kevin Durant given you?

Steph Chambers-Getty Images

YW: He keeps telling me no matter what to keep shooting with confidence. Someone like him telling me to shoot means I better shoot. He gave me a lot of confidence. Every time I make shots he always reacts and is hyped and happy. That’s what keeps me going. I really appreciate his leadership.

On a non-guaranteed contract what has this season done to show that you’re an NBA player and belong here?

YW: Defensively I always thought I was fine in Toronto. There was a time I was getting minutes because of my defense but my offense was a problem. I was so inconsistent with my three-point shot. I knew if I could shoot the ball with confidence and consistency I knew I could get more minutes. That’s what I’ve been doing now. I’m shooting very well now but I can’t forget that I started playing minutes because of my defense energy work ethic and passion.

What’s been the toughest part of your NBA journey so far?

YW: I’ve been through a lot of tough spots. The last four years besides the little bit of time I was playing minutes I was always on the bench and not playing. I’ve been in the G League for the first two years. The first year in Toronto I was on a two-way and the next year I was partially guaranteed. I’ve been non-guaranteed and this year I’m still non-guaranteed. Even though I’m not playing minutes I’ve never taken it for granted. There are a lot of people out there who want to be in the league and it didn’t matter if I’m the 13th 14th or 15th man and I didn’t get minutes. I always went to the gym and worked on my game. When I don’t play I always stand up and cheer for my teammates. If my minutes started going down this season I’m not going to change that. I’m going to be there for my teammates. After the game I’ll just want to go to the gym and work on my game.

Did you ever doubt you’d get to this point given what you’ve gone through?

Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports

YW: Yeah I’m not going to lie. There was a time I thought I might not belong to this league. My family friends teammates and coaching staff always encouraged me to keep my head up. I wouldn’t be here without those people who I’ve met on my journey. I really appreciate everything they’ve done for me.

What’s been the best part of your career to this point?

YW: I’m definitely enjoying this moment right now. Before the injury I was out there playing a lot of minutes and playing in clutch time making shots. I’ve seen my teammates happy and I was making winning plays. I’ve been through tough situations but I know that it was necessary to be here. I’m glad I never gave up.

Have you thought about your future?

YW: I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future but even though my contract could get guaranteed one day or I get a multi-year contract the way I play isn’t going to change. I’ll always play with a high level of intensity and play hard. I always play like this might be my last day in the NBA. I don’t want to take it for granted. This isn’t going to last forever. Non-guaranteed or guaranteed the way I play won’t change.

What goals do you have for your career?

Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports

Watanabe: I don’t have individual goals but I’ve always wanted to win a championship. I know we have that chance here. I know we had a slow start but as you can see we’re getting so much better since the beginning. The chemistry is growing and we’re trusting each other while the communication is getting better. I know we have a chance here. I want to help the Nets win the championship.

(Bloomberg) –Dirty bulk ships used to carry iron ore are being scrubbed clean so that they can transport grain to Asia in an unusual shift of cargoes prompted by a slump in demand for the steelmaking ingredient.

China’s downturn in the housing market has weighed on iron ore driving freight rates for bulk carriers down 50% from a year earlier. That’s made it more attractive for some of the world’s biggest agriculture traders to book iron ore vessels for shipments of corn and soybeans.

While the number of such cargo switches are relatively small it’s the latest shift by traders wrestling with dramatic changes in commodities markets sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s weakening economy. The war created extreme volatility in global grain markets allowing trading houses such as Cargill Inc. to post bumper profits.

Large iron ore ships typically stay away from grain as it involves a time-consuming cleaning processto make the vessels safe for carrying food. Washing a huge cargo hold dirty from iron ore is a necessary step to ensure that consumers of the grain — humans or other animals — don’t ingest rust metallic sand or dirt.

Before picking up grain cleaning gangs first have to lower themselves by winch into black-stained cargo holds. They then blast water and chemicals at high pressure against the walls before using brushes to scrub out gunk and then siphon the muddy water away.

The deep-cleaning process can cost between $7000 and $8000 and require a few extra days of chartering according to one trader. This could extend to a week and require shipyard workers to sand down and repaint the walls if the dirty coating can’t be removed.

The ships of choice are Baby Capes the smallest of Capesize vessels with capacity to carry about 100000 tons. That’s much bigger than Panamax bulk vessels that normally carry grain and hold about 60000 tons.

The depressed iron ore trade this year could be pushing Baby Capes to seek “alternative employment” said Ralph Leszczynski head of research at shipbroker Banchero Costa & Co.

The main allure for switching is price despite the extra cleaning cost. In the first 10 months of this year it was cheaper to hire a Capesize vessel than a Panamax by an average of $5200 per day the most for that time period since data going back to 1999 according to Arrow Shipbroking Group.

China’s COFCO International Ltd. and US-based Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and Cargill have booked about four Baby Capes to deliver grain to Asia next year from South America said people with knowledge of the matter. ADM declined to comment.

COFCO International said it has recently booked its first Baby Cape vessels to transport soymeal from Brazil to Southeast Asia next year.

“Initially it comes down to simple economies of scale — the more we load the cheaper the freight cost is for our customers and the lower the carbon footprint” said Alessio La Rosa global head of freight at COFCO International.

A spokesperson for Cargill said it routinely uses Baby Capes for grain and other shipments and expects to see more of such vessels in the future.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Each image has a resolution of 5207 × 3469 pixels and was saved in the Canon proprietary raw format CR242. The collected images were visually inspected and the framed organisms were counted tagged and labeled. The Fig. 3 shows an example of acquired image highlighting some organisms captured by the imaging device.

Fig. 3 Example of underwater image acquired by the imaging device. Detailed examples of the present faunal organisms are highlighted. Full size image

The image dataset encompasses different environmental conditions including short-term and seasonal light dynamics icepack coverage and a short period with occurrence of bio-fouling on the camera porthole. The images shown in Fig. 4 provide several examples of the environmental conditions occurring along the acquisition period of the image dataset. Each row contains five images acquired consecutively while different rows correspond to images sequences acquired in different periods and spanning the whole image dataset.

Fig. 4 A set of examples sampled form the image dataset. Each row consists of images acquired consecutively while different rows correspond to different periods within the monitoring activity. Full size image

The images in Fig. 4a–c exemplify the acquisitions between the end of February and the beginning of May. Each of the three sequences alternate bright images where the natural ambient light is diffused through the water column (and the icepack when present) and darker images corresponding to the dark short-term periods produced by the light/shadow cycle caused by the cliff in proximity of the monitored site2830. During the shadow periods the natural diffused light is attenuated and the foreground objects (e.g. the sponge) are illuminated by the lighting system of the imaging device. The water’s greenish hue in Fig. 4a acquired in February is caused by a huge phytoplankton bloom occurring after the icepack melting. In the sequence shown in Fig. 4b corresponding to march the icepack is present again and the strong reduction of diffused light might be probably caused by a temporary cloudy sky or by the accumulation of snow on the icepack surface. The images in Fig. 4b also show the presence of bio-fouling on the porthole of the camera following the phytoplankton bloom. Such bio-fouling is suddenly reduced from the sequence in Fig. 4c corresponding to April until the end of the acquisition period (Fig. 4j) corresponding to November.

Examples of images acquired during the Antarctic night are shown in Fig. 4d corresponfing to June. In this case the bio-fouling is not present anymore the diffused natural light is completely absent and all the images in the sequence are illuminated by the lighting system of the imaging device. After the end of the Antarctic night (end of August) the natural light increases with some discontinuities Fig. 4e–g until the end of September where a significant decrease happens as shown in Fig. 4h–j yet probably caused by a cloudy sky or by the accumulation of snow on the sea pack. In all the images from Fig. 4b to Fig. 4j it is possible to note the presence of the frozen sea surface during the daylight periods.

After the acquisition of the first 109 images (out of 755 images) the imaging device moved slightly downward and rightward producing an offset of a few pixels (30 × 108 pixels) in the position of the sponge with respect to the borders of the image.

The image dataset is accessible through the Zenodo repository43 and consists of the records presented in Table 1.

Table 1 The image datset archives. Full size table

All the images in the archives Raw_Images JPG_Images 640 × 427 and ICE-LAPSE_tags have a filename starting with the string IMG _<id> where <id> is a number varying between 609 and 1367 that unambiguously identifies each image file. The two archives Raw_Images and JPG_Images contain the full resolution images in raw and JPEG formats respectively. The ICE-LAPSE_tags archive provides information on the organisms classification performed by expert biologists. It contains two folders and three files:

TaggedImages

TextualTags

Classes.txt

SpeciesColorLabel.jpg

SpeciesDistribution.csv

The TaggedImages folder contains the dataset images where each organism identified in the visual inspection is highlighted by a colored bounding-box (tag) accompanied by a number. The color and the number associated to each tag represent the organism’s species as listed in the files Classes.txt or SpeciesColorLabel.jpg. An example of a tagged image is shown in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5 An example of tagged image where the labelled (colored) boxes represent the following taxa: 0 Odontaster validus Koehler 1906; 4 Sterechinus neumayeri (Meissner 1900); 5 Ammothea sp.; 11 Trematomus spp. Full size image

The TextualTags folder contains one text file for each image of the dataset. Each row in the file represents a tag in the corresponding image. The image tagging has been performed with the labelImage44 graphical tool and each row in the file has the following format:

$$ < label\_id > < x > < y > < w > < h > $$

where <label_id> is a number identifying the species of the tagged organisms as listed in the file Classes.txt <x> <y> <w> and <h> are the coordinates of the centre of the tagging box and the corresponding width and hight respectively.

All data were acquired from two case–control studies including control subjects PD patients and iRBD patients who underwent overnight-video-polysomnography (PSG). All iRBD patients were recruited from the general population through newspaper advertisements. Following a structured telephone interview subjects with a high likelihood of having RBD were invited to undergo PSG. Subjects in whom iRBD was excluded by video-PSG were considered control subjects in the further analysis. PD patients were recruited via an advertisement in the German Parkinson’s disease magazine from local self-help groups and the outpatient clinic of the University Hospital Cologne. All PSGs were evaluated by a board-certified sleep expert (MS). Inclusion criteria comprised the following: age 40–80 years (PD patients 50–80 years) no diagnosis of dementia no severe comorbidity (e.g. cancer end-stage renal or liver disease) no known stroke or traumatic brain injury. Medication was assessed and hypnotics antidepressants or neuroleptics had to be discontinued two weeks before PSG in all non-PD subjects. PD was diagnosed according to the current Movement Disorders Society guidelines26. Both studies were approved by the local ethical committee (Ethics Commission of Cologne University’s Faculty of Medicine). All participants gave written informed consent before participating. The work was carried out under the Declaration of Helsinki.

All PSGs were undertaken at home or in a hotel room. We used a mobile SOMNOscreen™ plus device for overnight video-PSG including ten EEG recordings (according to the international 10/20 system: F3 F4 C3 C4 O1 O2 A1 A2 Fpz as grounding and Cz as reference) electrooculography surface EMG of the mentalis the tibialis anterior (TA) and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles (FDS acquired in n = 143 (= 85.1% of all) PSGs) electrocardiography nasal pressure and flow monitoring thoracic and abdominal respiratory effort belts finger pulse oximetry and synchronized audio-visual recording. Before turning the lights off electrode impedances were checked to be lower than 10kΩ. All EMG channels were recorded at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. 10 Hz high pass 100 Hz lowpass filters and a 50 Hz notch filter were applied before analysis.

Visual PSG scoring was performed on 30-s epochs including sleep efficiency total sleep time the absolute amounts of stage 1 (N1) stage 2 (N2) stage 3 (N3) and REM sleep the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI number of apnea plus hypopnea events per hour of sleep) and the periodic limb movement index (PLMI number of periodic leg movements per hour of sleep) according to the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events Version 2.619. Diagnosis of RBD was made according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD)-3 criteria27. Visual PSG scoring and diagnosis of RBD was done by MS who is a board-certified sleep expert. The evaluation was blinded from the visual RSWA scorings of NO and NW as well as from the RBDtector results. RBD diagnosis of the sleep expert was used as the gold standard for assessments of classification performance. Final diagnosis could not be achieved in five subjects due to technical failure of video-recording (n = 1) increased RSWA without anamnestic or video-recorded enactment of dream content (n = 1) or severe REM-associated sleep apnea making it impossible to judge muscle activity (n = 3). These PSGs were discarded from further analysis.

Visual RSWA scoring

Rules for RSWA scoring were adopted from the original publication of the SINBAR group from 2012 and applied to all EMG channels in the same way18: Increased muscle activity was defined as EMG activity with an amplitude of at least twice the background muscle tone (= baseline) for at least 100 ms. An interval of more than 250 ms with baseline activity defined the end of increased EMG activity. Depending on the duration of increased muscle activity we scored ‘phasic’ bouts for activity lasting between 0.1 and 5.0 s and ‘intermediate’ bouts for activity lasting between 5.1 and 15 s (needed to calculate any activity). Each 30 s sleep epoch was subdivided into ten 3 s mini-epochs and each mini-epoch was counted as phasic if it contained at least one ‘phasic’ bout. Each mini-epoch was scored as comprising any activity if any ‘phasic’ ‘intermediate’ or ‘tonic’ bouts were present. We scored a 30 s epoch with tonic activity if increased EMG activity was present in more than 50% of the total 30 s epoch—this could be achieved by a sustained increase of EMG activity for more than 15 s without an interruption of 250 ms of baseline activity (= ‘tonic’ bout) and by ‘phasic’ and ‘intermediate’ bouts exceeding 15 s during a 30 s epoch. To identify a ‘phasic’ or ‘intermediate’ bout superimposing a sustained tonic activity it was required that the ‘phasic’ or ‘intermediate’ bout had at least twice the amplitude of the background tonic activity.

Visual scoring was performed by a sleep expert (NO “expert scorer”) with multiple years of experience in clinical sleep medicine and by a doctoral candidate in sleep medicine (NW “novice scorer”) who was introduced to the SINBAR scoring system and scored EMGs of 20 PSGs supervised by MS. We included two scorers with different levels of training to acknowledge that visual RSWA scoring is not only scorer-dependent but might also be dependent on the expertise of an individual scorer22. To ensure a common understanding of the rating system both scorers were allowed to rate 5 PSGs with and 5 PSGs without RBD unblinded to RBD-status and to the scorings of the other scorer. Ratings were jointly discussed with MS as an independent referee to agree on judgements between scorers.

We randomly selected 10 iRBD patients and 10 controls for blinded visual RSWA scoring on mentalis FDS and TA EMG for comparison with the algorithm’s results. Additionally both human scorers rated EMG activity as artefacts if they did not consider the activity as caused by physiological muscle activity (examples of artefacts include snoring technical issues respiration and electrocardiography). The combined artefact intervals of both human scorers were excluded from the inter-rater comparisons. Arousals had been identified during routine PSG scoring and were excluded. Ratings were executed using DOMINO software (SOMNOmedics Randersacker Germany) and exported for further analysis.

Implementation of RSWA scoring to a computer algorithm

RBDtector is based on Python 3.8 (including Python libraries pandas and PyEDFlib) and reads EMG data in European Data Format (EDF). The sleep profile arousal events and optionally respiratory events as well as snoring artefacts are gathered from plain text files. For this study specifically data were exported from DOMINO software.

EMG data are resampled to 256 Hz using spline interpolation if not already recorded at this sampling rate. REM sleep periods are extracted from the sleep profile. Previously identified arousals and respiratory events are handled as artefacts and discarded in all EMG channels whereas periods of snoring are only considered for (and excluded in) mentalis EMG.

Subsequently automated baseline detection of each ‘REM sleep period’ is performed separately. By definition a ‘REM sleep period’ must contain continuous REM sleep for ≥ 150 s. REM sleep with EMG activity with a root mean square (RMS) < 0.05 mV is handled as an artefact (i.e. electrode detachment) and excluded from further analysis. Next each ‘REM sleep period’ is assigned the amplitude with the lowest RMS of a 30 s rolling window from a continuously artefact-free (without arousal and respiratory events as well as snoring) REM period as ‘baseline amplitude’. Periods of REM sleep that do not meet these criteria are assigned to the ‘baseline amplitude’ of the previous REM period or the following if no previous one is available. If no ‘baseline amplitude’ can be estimated the process is repeated with a rolling window size of 15 s. If this process is unsuccessful the affected channel is discarded from further analysis. REM bouts shorter than 150 s are assigned the ‘baseline amplitude’ of the nearest REM period.

After excluding artefacts and determining ‘baseline amplitudes’ the SINBAR RSWA scoring rules are applied to all EMG channels stepwise. First amplitudes for individual 30 ms bouts are defined. For that purpose RBDtector calculates the RMS of the EMG amplitudes within a sliding window of 30 ms length beginning at an artefact-free REM bout. The sliding window is shifted with a step size of 15 ms yielding RMS values at a temporal resolution of 15 ms. 30 ms REM bouts with amplitudes exceeding two times the ‘baseline amplitude’ are considered ‘activity bouts’. Next connected ‘activity bouts’ lasting longer than 0.1 s are identified and considered as an ‘activity event’. To those ‘activity events’ preceding and following ‘activity bouts’ are added if no interruption occurs that has less activity than twice the ‘baseline amplitude’ for ≥ 0.25 s. This process is repeated until interruptions of ≥ 0.25 s with activity less than twice the ‘baseline amplitude’ are eventually identified (= ‘increased activity’).

In the next step RSWA is classified as tonic phasic or any. For scoring tonic activity each 30 s epoch of REM sleep is examined for containing ≥ 50% of ‘increased activity’. If tonic activity is scored in one epoch the baseline value of this 30 s epoch is elevated to the RMS of the period of tonic activity. Subsequently if tonic activity is identified ‘increased activity’ to identify phasic activity is recalculated in this channel to account for the changes in the baseline.

Phasic activity is detected if ‘increased activity’ persists ≤ 5 s. Phasic events are calculated by subdividing 30 s macro epochs into ten 3 s mini epochs and each mini epoch containing ‘increased activity’ is scored as phasic activity. Mini epochs with any activity are detected by combining all 30 s macro epochs with tonic activity and all 3 s mini epochs containing ‘increased activity’ between 0.1 and 15 s.

For phasic and any activity the maximum amplitude and duration of “increased activity” bouts are determined and the respective arithmetic mean of all bouts per channel is computed.

Finally a CSV file with the exact event timestamps and two xlsx files containing the SINBAR event evaluation data are created. The first xlsx file includes phasic tonic and any (mini-) epochs per evaluated EMG channel both in absolute numbers and in percent of the channel’s artefact-free REM sleep (mini-)epochs. Additionally the mean values of maximum amplitude and duration for the phasic and any events are given and the total amounts of REM sleep (mini-)epochs with and without the relevant artefacts. The second xlsx file depicts the percentage of RSWA events on combined channels relative to the amount of artefact-free REM sleep.

Statistical analysis

We explored the data with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 28. Group data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or relative frequencies unless otherwise stated. Normal data distribution was assessed with the Shapiro–Wilk test Q-Q plots and box plots. Group comparisons were calculated using Student’s t Mann–Whitney U and chi-square tests as well as analyses of variances and Kruskal–Wallis tests as appropriate. Univariate correlation analyses were calculated using Spearman’s rho. Coefficients of determination (R2) were used to compare inter-rater variability on a subject level (= amount of RSWA as a percentage of total REM sleep of the given subject) and Cohen’s kappa on a single epoch level (= binary single 3 s mini- and 30 s epoch scorings respectively). We analysed discrimination performance with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated for each analysis and cut-off thresholds are given for the highest specificity. Additionally we calculated sensitivity and accuracy at that threshold. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05.

We also compared RBDtector RSWA estimates on data from a previous study of the SINBAR group25. Inclusion and exclusion criteria acquisition of PSG data and analysis as well as methods for RSWA quantification are described elsewhere25.",,,,,,

Given enough time most quality stocks will eventually double triple quadruple and even quintuple their value. That's just how capitalism works. No stock will necessarily reach these milestones at the same time as any other equity though; some will move faster than others.

With that backdrop here's a closer look at three tickers with great shots at turning a $1000 investment today into $5000 as soon as 2030. Notice that each company brings something special to the table at an ideal time.

Monster Beverage

The world needs a serious pick-me-up if the recent sales growth achieved by energy drink outfit Monster Beverage (MNST 0.47%) is any indication. The company's top line is up nearly 16% through the first three quarters of this year extending a span of comparable revenue growth underway for over a decade now. Analysts don't see any real slowdown on the horizon either modeling 11% sales growth next year that's apt to be topped when all is said and done.

Yes Monster Beverage is the outfit behind energy drinks of the same brand name but it's not just Monster. The company also manages Nos Full Throttle Predator and a handful of other energy drink brands. Monster is its flagship though making up the lion's share of its annual top line of around $6 billion.

It's not a lot. But that's the point -- there's room for the entire category to continue growing. And it is. Mordor Intelligence estimates the energy drinks business is on pace to grow by more than 8% per year through 2027 jibing with other growth outlooks for the industry. Monster has something of a secret weapon however helping it win more than its fair share of this growth.

That's Coca-Cola.

Coke has been a Monster stakeholder and partner since 2015. The relationship is still being increasingly leveraged for growth though and yet there's so much more that could be done going forward. Take cannabis for instance. While Coca-Cola doesn't offer cannabis-based drinks right now it is entering new and once-unlikely markets.

For example early this year Coca-Cola entered the alcoholic beverage fray by inking a developmental deal with Constellation Brands...the same Constellation reportedly mulling an acquisition bid for Monster. It's noteworthy simply because Constellation also owns a sizable stake in cannabis company Canopy Growth Corp. and Coca-Cola has at least entertained the possibility of entering the cannabis arena in the recent past.

It's unclear how or if any of these possible combinations and partnerships will shake out. What is clear is that Monster Beverage is well-positioned for whatever the future holds on this front.

Amazon

Perhaps the biggest reason Amazon (AMZN -1.07%) shares could quintuple their current value by 2030 is that shares are down a whopping 46% from last year's peak; simply recovering that loss would mean nearly a 100% gain on its present price. Nevertheless this company's backstory has far more potential than a mere recovery of the stock's recent setback.

This backstory is no longer about e-commerce however.

While selling stuff online remains its biggest business as measured by revenue it's not even close to being its biggest moneymaker. That honor belongs to its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services (AWS). Even prior to this year when soaring expenses dragged its e-commerce operation into the red its cloud computing division was driving roughly two-thirds of its operating income.

The company's cloud computing profitability profile hasn't really changed much since then. It's just grown. AWS' revenue through the first three quarters of this year is up 32% pulling its operating income up 33% with it. In light of Technavio's expectation for annualized growth of 19% for the cloud computing market through 2026 Amazon doesn't necessarily even need its e-commerce business's paper-thin profit margins to be restored to their pre-pandemic levels to continue growing its bottom line at a double-digit pace.

The kicker: Whether or not e-commerce itself is ever profitable again for Amazon may be irrelevant. Its advertising business fueled by the shopping site's traffic is a fast-growing profit center in and of itself. The company did a hefty $9.5 billion ad sales last quarter alone up 25% year over year. And it's still largely learning the advertising business.

AutoZone

Finally add AutoZone (AZO -0.26%) to your list of stocks that could turn $1000 today into $5000 by 2030.

Surprised? As unbelievable as it seems the auto parts and car-care business isn't just consistent but also high-growth. AutoZone's revenue growth of 11% for the fiscal year ending in August is both impressive and in line with the industry's long-term norms. The stock's performance is equally impressive. AutoZone shares are up 50% for the past five years despite their steep (and likely temporary) sell-off since the end of last year and are more than twice their value 10 years ago.

Those are solid numbers but hardly a quintupling. There's good reason to believe the next eight years could prove remarkably more fruitful for AutoZone than the past eight have been however. That's the sheer cost of a new car.

There was a time when consumers recognized that it made more sense to purchase a new automobile than continue spending more and more money just to keep an aging vehicle running. With Kelley Blue Book reporting that the average price for a new car sold in the United States rose to a near-record $48281 in October though the math of the matter changes.

It's once again making increasingly more sense to invest in the automobile you already own -- even more so when the economy is wobbling as it is now. Underscoring this argument is S&P Global's estimate that the average vehicle being driven on U.S. roads is a record-breaking 12.2 years old. While it's a testament to their quality and durability it also suggests they're highly fixable.

It all plays right into the hand AutoZone is holding of course particularly in light of the likelihood that car prices won't be meaningfully dropping anytime soon.",,,,,,

AXON,Axon Enterprise,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzA0L3RoZXNlLTMtc3RvY2tzLWhhdmUtZG91YmxlZC1jYW4tdGhleS1kby1pdC1hZ2Fpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 3 Stocks Have Doubled in Less Than 1 Year -- Can They Do It Again?,"Investors can find market-beating investments even when most stocks are down.

The S&P 500 is down 14% year to date as of this writing. As it stands this is the worst year for the stock market since 2008. And it's the third-worst year for stocks since 1974.

With depressing results like these you might think the market is comprised entirely of losers but you'd be wrong. Shares of beverage company Celsius Holdings (CELH 0.90%) shoemaker Crocs (CROX 2.56%) and law enforcement technology company Axon Enterprise (AXON -1.83%) have already more than doubled from their 52-week lows and look poised for future gains.

1. Celsius up 180% since Jan. 27

Celsius sells energy drinks it claims will burn calories even when resting. The company has been around for about two decades but only gained meaningful distribution and market share in recent years. And with its recent gains the stock has roared higher. It's up not only 180% from this year's low but also up over 2000% in just the past three years.

Obviously it's not enough to just increase distribution -- consumers must also buy the product -- but that's what's happening with Celsius. Year to date Celsius has been the top driver of growth in the U.S. energy drink category. Consumers apparently love it so it's not surprising the company's top line is soaring as well with year-to-date revenue up 126% compared to the same period in 2021.

If it's true that increased distribution is driving gains for Celsius stock shareholders better hold onto their hats. The company signed a distribution deal with PepsiCo that Celsius' management says will take the ""business to the next level.""

Pepsi only took over Celsius' distribution on Oct. 1 so the impact of the deal wasn't felt during the third quarter of 2022. However Celsius' management noted an immediate increase in sales metrics in the weeks following the change which bodes well for the fourth quarter and beyond.

In my opinion the most tantalizing aspect of Celsius' deal with Pepsi is international expansion. Through the first three quarters of 2022 Celsius has generated net sales of $476 million 94% of which came from North American markets. By contrast Pepsi is a global brand and it has the international network to propel Celsius to worldwide prominence.

I wouldn't expect 180% returns in 2023 but Celsius still has a long runway for future gains even if another doubling isn't imminent.

2. Crocs up 111% since June 16

I believe Crocs stock can double faster than Celsius. The path is clear.

A big component of my investment thesis relates to Croc's $2.5 billion acquisition of peer Heydude. For starters I believe it paid a great price. The Heydude brand alone is expected to generate revenue of $940 million to $980 million in 2022 meaning Crocs paid just 2.6 times sales for the fast-growing brand. For perspective Heydude's revenue was around $570 million in 2021 giving it about 68% year-over-year growth.

Heydude will help Crocs fuel its top line in the coming years but the Crocs brand itself is still growing nicely as well. Management expects full-year Crocs brand revenue of over $2.6 billion in 2022 up 13%. And by expanding into new geographies gaining market share and raising prices management believes it can achieve over $6 billion in total company revenue in 2026 -- just four full years from now.

Crocs' profit margins are better than Heydude's. In the third quarter Crocs brand had a gross margin of 54.9% whereas Heydude's gross margin was just 48.8%. But I'm betting Crocs' more experienced management team can squeeze greater profitability out of Heydude in the coming years.

Long term management is shooting for an operating margin of at least 26%. If it surpasses $6 billion in revenue the company's operating income could reach 1.5 billion. And if the stock trades at a multiple of just eight times its operating profit -- a below-average valuation -- Crocs would have a market capitalization of $12 billion in 2026.

That's double where Crocs stock trades today. So no it's not too late for long-term investors to buy Crocs stock.

3. Axon Enterprise up 120% since May 11

On Nov. 8 Axon Enterprise reported financial results for the third quarter of 2022 and it was the company's best quarter this year. The company grew revenue 34% year over year to $312 million earned $12 million in net income and raised revenue guidance for full-year 2022. But these aren't the numbers that impressed me the most.

Most of Axon's revenue comes in package deals. Agencies can get nonlethal Tasers body cameras cloud storage and software services all in one contract. These contracts are signed for long periods some even 10 years giving investors great visibility into future revenue. But this also means the business generates a large percentage of recurring revenue.

These are the numbers that impressed me: Axon's annual recurring revenue (ARR) at the end of the third quarter was $403 million up 9.5% quarter over quarter. That's Axon's largest quarterly jump in ARR this year. Moreover the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) sit at $3.7 billion up $400 million from the second quarter and the biggest quarterly jump in 2022.

Of these stocks I believe it will take Axon the longest to double from here because of its price tag. Some might point out its valuation is comparable to Celsius. However Celsius should see stronger growth in the near term thanks to its partnership with Pepsi. By contrast Axon stock looks like it might be getting ahead of itself.

That said if you told me I had to invest in only one of these three companies and couldn't touch the investment even once for the next 10 years I'd invest in Axon. As noted its long-term contracts make this an incredibly predictable business. It's gaining momentum with new customer bases including federal agencies like the Secret Service. And the company is loaded with $371 million in cash equivalents and investments with no debt.

To be clear I like Celsius Crocs and Axon as long-term investments but Axon is as strong of an investment opportunity as they come.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The New Mexico State Land Office saw increases in revenue from both forms of energy as New Mexico maintained its position as the second-largest producer of crude oil in U.S. operations centered in the Permian Basin in the state’s southeast region.

But state leaders also sought to diversify New Mexico’s energy supply pushing development of renewable energies like wind solar power and hoping to expand the use of state land beyond the state’s largest industry in oil and gas – which accounts for about a third of its budget.

“Diversification is one of the leading tenets of my administration and we’re starting to see excellent results from these efforts” said New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands Stephanie Garcia Richard.

Here are the biggest accomplishments of the New Mexico State Land Office in 2022 a year of growth in energy sectors but also of a transitioning energy market.

Oil and gas revenue breaks records for New Mexico

About $2 billion in revenue was generated by the Land Office via fossil fuel production and royalties paid on State Trust land the office leases to oil and gas companies in Fiscal Year 2022.

The Office oversaw 6800 oil and gas leases in FY 2022 records show along with 255 mineral leases and 556 easements for freshwater and saltwater disposal totaling about 2.3 million acres of State Trust land.

The land office also reclaimed 98 acres of state land where minerals were previously extracted.

Most of that was in southeast New Mexico in Eddy and Lea counties that share the Permian Basin with rural West Texas.

The Permian is the largest oilfield in the U.S. generating more than 5.5 million barrels of oil per day almost half of the U.S.’ total output according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Growth in fossil fuels on state lands help propel New Mexico to also be second after Texas in oil and gas drilling rigs according to Baker Hughes meaning interest remained high in the state for future production.

Oil and gas also was largely credited in fueling a record $2.4 billion in revenue at the State Land Office this year money used to fund hospitals public schools and universities.

That’s almost half of the $5.4 billion the office generated in the last four years Garcia Richards’ first term and almost double the previous record of $1.25 billion brought in for FY 2021.

The State Land Office also reported as of FY 2022 it plugged and remediated more than 100 abandoned oil and gas wells.

Renewable energy could prove a path toward diversifying state land use

Renewable energy including wind and solar tripled on State Trust land in FY 2022 since 2019 – the year the Land Office’s Office of Renewable Energy – bringing production from 400 megawatts (MW) that year to 1200 MW this year.

The past fiscal year saw $12 million in revenue brought in from the developments records show.

Since 2019 the Land Office reported a 208 percent increase in active leases a 249 percent increase in leased megawatts and a 1400 percent growth in annual revenue.

Pattern Energy was a lead producer of renewable energy in New Mexico this year winning bids for 11 wind energy leases on State Trust land in June totaling 147684 acres in Lincoln Torrance and San Miguel counties.

In total the leases were expected to generate 500 MW of wind power and $196 million in revenue during their lifetime.

Pattern also took the reigns of the Sun Zia Transmission project which received state approvals from New Mexico and Arizona in July.

That project would move up to 3000 MW of New Mexico wind energy about 500 miles to southern Arizona where it can be provided to larger urban markets in that state or further west to California.

Outdoor recreation emerging as growth industry

The State Land Office reported its outdoor recreation access permits grew by about 28 percent in the last year for a total of 872 as the office worked to increase access to recreational access on State Trust land.

To do this the Land Office partnered with several New Mexico organizations on projects.

That included a disco golf course in Silver City via an agreement with Western New Mexico University improvements to bird watching in Melrose Woods in Roosevelt County through the New Mexico Audubon Society and a partnership with the federal Bureau of Land Management on easement for the Continental Divide Trail expected to be completed by FY 2023.

When Amy Ogden started working in Southern Nevada real estate in 2006 warehouse tenants were mostly tasked with trucking goods to hotels and convention halls.

New projects also were poorly designed. Developers would squeeze a warehouse to the edge of its land resulting in tight parking bad loading areas and Ogden recalled it led to a nickname for such buildings.

“It was a broken box” said Ogden an industrial property broker with Logic Commercial Real Estate.

Firms still haul goods to the Strip but the region’s warehouse market has exploded in growth — making Southern Nevada much more than a place where people deliver food linens and the like to Las Vegas’ resort corridor.

Through a combination of factors including the huge growth of e-commerce available land and proximity to Southern California America’s casino capital has emerged as a competitive player in the warehousing and distribution industry.

Rising interest rates have taken some wind out of the market’s sails industry pros say and the U.S. economy has been wobbly. Plus any real estate deal and certainly any building boom comes with risks.

But over the past several years the local industrial market has undergone a transformation. Developers have flooded Southern Nevada with massive warehouse projects especially in North Las Vegas; more tenants have been distributing products to other states; fierce demand for space has pushed vacancies to record-lows; and a rising tally of developers and other investors started doing deals here.

“(It’s) really crazy how active this market has become” said Colliers International broker Dan Doherty a longtime industrial real estate specialist in the valley.

‘The secret got out’

Las Vegas’ warehouse market had been growing for years before the pandemic sent the sector into overdrive as the public health crisis sparked an accelerated shift to online shopping that fueled demand for distribution space.

Taylor Arnett first vice president of acquisitions at developer CapRock Partners said his firm and others have been leasing projects “as quickly as we’ve ever seen it in any of our careers.”

Four or five years ago it would typically take six to 12 months to lease a new project. Today he added it would be “strange” for a project to not have any leasing activity while still under construction.

Arnett whose firm has built around 2 million square feet of industrial space in Southern Nevada said it’s close to finishing another 700000 square feet. Most of that new batch is pre-leased he said.

Other signs of the warehouse boom:

— In September a footwear brand owned by clogs maker Crocs Inc. announced plans for a roughly 730000-square-foot distribution center in North Las Vegas — in a complex that broke ground this summer.

— A new industrial park near North Las Vegas Airport sold for more than $140 million in October the month after construction finished and was already fully leased.

— Last month VanTrust Real Estate announced it started construction on the first two buildings of a 350-acre project it’s developing in North Las Vegas’ Apex Industrial Park and it already signed a tenant for one of the buildings.

Overall Southern Nevada has around 153 million square feet of industrial space up from 123 million in 2017 according to data from John Stater Colliers’ Las Vegas research manager.

Much of the construction in recent years has been speculative meaning developers started projects without users lined up. But tenants have been plentiful. The market’s vacancy rate is just 1.3 percent down from 4.5 percent in 2017.

Keith Earnest executive vice president at VanTrust said he viewed Southern Nevada as a “sleeper” market years ago adding there “wasn’t much activity” in construction.

In recent years however other developers and landlords have entered the market.

“Unfortunately the secret got out” Earnest said.

‘It’s a gamble’

In the mid-1990s when Doug Roberts started working in Southern Nevada’s industrial market there were some regional and national tenants. But the market was mostly dominated by firms that supplied Las Vegas’ resorts and convention facilities he recalled.

New buildings also were typically smaller than what developers put up now. Back then a big project was 200000 to 250000 square feet said Roberts a partner with Panattoni Development Co.

Southern Nevada had a big wave of warehouse construction in the early- and mid-2000s as the broader real estate market surged on easy money. But after the bubble burst and the economy tanked industrial development largely ground to a halt.

Only around 52700 square feet of industrial space was completed in 2011 after developers built more than 42 million square feet from 2000 through 2008 according to Stater’s numbers.

Rob Lujan broker with Jones Lang LaSalle said site locators probably skipped over Las Vegas a decade or so ago because the recession had crushed the local economy so badly.

“A lot of real estate groups just shied away” he said.

In 2014 with the economy still limping out of the Great Recession Las Vegas consulting firm RCG Economics cited “a gap between supply and demand” that indicated an opportunity for more industrial space in Southern Nevada.

“But many developers are not constructing new buildings” the firm said in a report.

Later that year warehouse developer Prologis held a ceremonial groundbreaking for a project in North Las Vegas saying the new building at roughly 464200 square feet was the region’s largest speculative industrial project in years.

By 2015 other spec projects were in the works including by Panattoni.

“It’s a gamble there’s no doubt about it” Roberts told the Las Vegas Sun at the time. “But we think we’re right.”

Tenants move in

Las Vegas’ casino-heavy economy has long been fueled by tourism. But amid the growth of e-commerce distributors found reasons to set up shop here.

The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are about 300 miles away and truckers leaving Las Vegas can service about 20 percent of the U.S. population in a day’s drive industry pros say.

Developers could also buy huge chunks of land at relatively low prices letting them lure tenants with more affordable rents. Also industry pros say Southern California’s higher real estate prices tight availability of warehouse space and longer development timelines made Southern Nevada — long known for lower costs and lighter regulations — an attractive alternative.

Warehouse construction surged with more than 5.3 million square feet of industrial space completed in Southern Nevada in 2019 up from about 1.4 million in 2015 according to Colliers.

Companies such as e-commerce giant Amazon beauty retailer Sephora baby products maker The Honest Co. and sports apparel retailer Fanatics opened distribution centers here. Fanatics which opened its North Las Vegas facility in 2017 told the Review-Journal recently that it picked the location to serve its West Coast customers.

By housing merchandise for teams in Nevada California Washington and other states it has been able to “cut down on delivery times to these fans” a spokesperson said.

Tapestry Inc. owner of luxury brands Coach and Kate Spade unveiled plans last year to open a distribution center in North Las Vegas to also serve West Coast customers. Its fulfillment center is expected to span more than 788000 square feet and designed to annually distribute 22.2 million units and hold 4 million units of inventory.

Overall the number of tenants in Las Vegas from around the United States is “magnitudes higher than it was just 10 years ago” Colliers’ Stater said.

Amazon effect

Amazon has an especially big footprint with 15 locations in Southern Nevada the company said.

Its ubiquitous blue delivery vans can be seen all over the Las Vegas Valley and Amazon operates multiple big industrial buildings near Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

Landlords have paid rising prices for Amazon’s buildings there too.

In April a Boston investment firm acquired an 857000-square-foot Amazon warehouse for $226.4 million as part of a two-building acquisition along Tropical Parkway off Interstate 15 property records show.

By comparison in 2017 an 813000-square-foot Amazon facility sold for $73.4 million as part of a two-building purchase along I-15 at Lamb Boulevard.

Sam Bailey manager of economic development policy at Amazon told the Review-Journal that Las Vegas can serve the Mountain West region “quite well” and back up or support such markets as California and Phoenix.

He cited Las Vegas’ available land access to talent and geographic location that he said is conducive to routing goods.

As a result Southern Nevada has been able to “step forward as a competitive market for distribution and e-commerce” Bailey said.

‘Balloon is slowly losing air’

Southern Nevada also has a track record of going gung-ho for real estate. Over the last few years amid a surge of investor spending industrial property values were driven so high it was “almost comparable to the housing bubble” said CapRock’s Arnett.

But he added “the balloon is slowly losing air.”

The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times this year in a bid to fight inflation driving up real estate financing costs for everyone from homebuyers to commercial property investors.

Southern Nevada’s industrial leasing is “still strong” but sales have slowed said Lujan of Jones Lang LaSalle.

“Groups just can’t afford to pay what they once could for properties” he said.

Also people will continue to shop online but if e-commerce spending slows demand for warehouse space could be affected.

Stater noted that developers would face risks “if the economy goes south pretty badly” and tenants stop signing leases for new projects.

“The question then is when are your loans coming due? How long can you wait for the economy to come back?” Stater said.

For now demand for warehouse space is “outpacing supply” with firms still hunting for buildings said Earnest of VanTrust.

“With that vacancy rate you feel pretty confident” he said.

Government help

The huge growth in Southern Nevada's industrial market has been heavily fueled by the rise of e-commerce.

But government spending and tax breaks have also helped as local officials have sought to lure distribution firms and diversify the region's casino-heavy economy.

""You can't drive through Southern Nevada now without seeing some sort of warehouse or distribution center along the highway"" said Kris Sanchez deputy director of the Governor's Office of Economic Development.

GOED has approved tax incentives for multiple industrial projects in the Las Vegas Valley in recent years including more than $25 million for a Google data center in Henderson and more than $15 million for a Novva Data Centers location in North Las Vegas.

It also approved $10.5 million in tax incentives for a Haas Automation complex in Henderson; more than $8.6 million for shoe brand Hey Dude's distribution facility in North Las Vegas; and $2.9 million for a North Las Vegas distribution center operated by Kate Spade owner Tapestry Inc.

In North Las Vegas where developers have been launching waves of big warehouse projects taxpayer dollars have helped expand the city's infrastructure enabling more construction.

In April 2017 for instance North Las Vegas City Council approved plans for about $43 million worth of street water and sewer projects in the Las Vegas Motor Speedway area which has been an especially popular spot for warehouse construction in recent years.

In September 2017 the U.S. Economic Development Administration spent $3 million for a sewer project in North Las Vegas that was designed to serve the ""growing area"" east of Interstate 15 and the 215 Beltway and north of Las Vegas Boulevard the agency said.

The project was slated to ""increase capacity and provide stability"" which was ""expected to lead to the expansion of several major manufacturing and logistics companies"" according to the EDA.

In 2018 the city of North Las Vegas teamed with a landowner on a 12-mile water pipeline project in Apex Industrial Park which after plodding along for years with little development amid a dearth of infrastructure has seen a burst of activity over the past year or so.

The Nevada Department of Transportation also awarded a $99 million contract in early 2020 for the construction of ramps flyovers and street connections at the Beltway/I-15 interchange in North Las Vegas.

North Las Vegas City Manager Ryann Juden said the city competes with markets outside Nevada for companies. But sometimes infrastructure will only count for so much when trying to recruit new employers given Nevada's consistently low-ranking public education system.

""That is a major hurdle that we have to cross all the time"" Juden said.

Apex comes to life

With the warehouse market booming in Southern Nevada more developers have ventured to North Las Vegas' Apex Industrial Park a rare surge of momentum for the remote area.

Apex off Interstate 15 at U.S. Highway 93 has been around for decades and offers thousands of acres for potential projects. But for a long time construction activity was scarce amid a dearth of infrastructure.

However utility service has been expanding to the area and over the past year or so multiple companies have bought land and pushed ahead with construction plans in the industrial park some 20 miles northeast of the Strip.

The increased activity at Apex also comes amid higher land prices and the depleted availability of project sites in the northeast valley's Las Vegas Motor Speedway area a popular warehouse construction spot in recent years.

Reno developer Dermody Properties broke ground last year on a 664300-square-foot distribution facility in Apex; aluminum beverage can maker Ball Corp. unveiled plans last year to build a plant at Apex; developer VanTrust Real Estate bought roughly 350 acres last year with plans for a 4.5 million-square-foot industrial park; and grocery chain Smith's purchased nearly 100 acres last year.

NorthPoint Development broke ground this summer on an industrial complex that's expected to span more than 2 million square feet. Hey Dude a footwear brand owned by Crocs Inc. unveiled plans to open a distribution facility in the project.

Rob Tecco vice president of North American distribution and logistics at Crocs Inc. said in September that the property size it needed wasn't available in other parts of the Las Vegas Valley.

""Everything else was spoken for near the Speedway"" he said.

There is no better way to get the Muncie community together than over food and golf for all ages. At least that’s what the president of Accutech Systems Corporation Adam Unger said.

The Clubhouse @ Accutech first opened its doors to the public in July 2022. While the path creating the ins and outs of the restaurant were challenging it was nothing but fun Scott Smalstig director of community growth at The Clubhouse @ Accutech said.

“[Unger] always wanted to do something that would help get rid of Muncie’s image of having nothing to do” Smalstig said.

Unger’s idea of philanthropy weighed heavily on him in the middle of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Combining a few ideas of what he saw around the country and with the help of Smalstig The Clubhouse @ Accutech was created.

“We still do plenty of [donating to non-profit organizations] but we wanted to do something that moved the needle in the community and that was to create this as our first project” Smalstig said. “We have also purchased Vera Mae’s [Bistro] down the street.”

According to the Accutech website “Accutech fulfills its purpose to make great things happen for other people by delivering innovative trust and wealth management technology solutions and exceptional personalized service for over 200 banks and wealth management companies nationwide.”

The company’s core values also lie with ensuring great things happen for their team as well as customers.

“This space was originally for Accutech employees to just chill out” Nick Kirkpatrick executive chief and general manager of The Clubhouse @ Accutech said.

The Clubhouse @ Accutech is located in the heart of Muncie a six-minute drive from Ball State University’s campus. Walking into the new business customers are immediately met with smiling caddies.

Many customers can be found walking throughout the wide open space moving at their own pace with a smile on their face. The venue consists of a dining area overlooking parts of Muncie and 16 holes to play in the micro-golfing section. Players can keep track of their scores for friendly competition.

“There’s no place like it in Muncie” Haleight Haffner fourth-year criminology major at Ball State said. “Micro Golf was very unique and at times very difficult. It was a great time [and] I love the atmosphere.”

The four digital golfing bays have 14 courses where customers can play like the pros. The bar has a more relaxed and dim atmosphere located next to Rays Bay where parties are booked. Guests might be surprised to learn the venue doesn’t just offer golf but just about any digital sport one can think of including carnival games. Players can bring their own golf clubs but the Clubhouse offers golfing equipment for ages 3 and up.

The Clubhouse @ Accutech can be compared to Top Golf but with a digital twist that includes a family-friendly environment and people don’t have to stand outside on a deck. Guests can easily stay inside to golf.

“It’s always sunny and 72 [degrees] here at The Clubhouse” Smalstig said laughing.

The Muncie Riverfront District project was put into effect by Ridenour after approval from the Delaware County Council in order to create less expensive liquor licenses. Ridenour said the purpose of this was to spark growth and economic development in Muncie furthering the creation of The Clubhouse @ Accutech.

“We didn’t know [Accutech] was interested in restaurants at that point but we’re really excited with what they put together” Ridenour said.

The Riverfront District ultimately made it easier for business owners looking to open restaurants downtown as one of the most profitable items in a restaurant to sell is liquor. Ridenour said a liquor license can help a business thrive and survive which increases demand downtown.

One thing Smalstig and Unger did was create more jobs in the Muncie community.

“I was hired to help create spin-off businesses to help meet our definition of philanthropy” Smalstig said. “Those three things are to create jobs enhance the quality of life in downtown Muncie and instill pride in the community.”

Smalstig said interacting with hundreds of people every week has proven to be difficult but impactful in a different way compared to their core business of software development.

“We have a couple clients from coast to coast but they’re not here in this community. We wanted a real impact” Smalstig said.

The need to bring people together again became precedent after the pandemic for those involved in the Muncie community. Ridenour said downtown is “really the heart of the city” and feels The Clubhouse @ Accutech is a big part of this comeback and hopes to continue this approach with more businesses in the future.

“Muncie’s a great city” Smalstig said. “We want the people of Muncie to be proud of our city and we feel there is a lot to be proud of.”

Adhering to a set of impact principles can unlock the transformative potential of this funding including focusing on where the benefits are greatest galvanizing a distributed financing network gaining optimal financial leverage deploying a mix of financing vehicles to catalyze private investment and mobilizing rapidly to meet 2030 targets.

To meet its net-zero target by 2050 the United States would need to quadruple its annual low-carbon investment reaching a total of $9 trillion over this decade.1 Almost half of the emissions reductions needed to reach the net-zero target come from a transformational and immediate shift in the energy system toward renewable-power generation and electrification of transportation and buildings.2 Some of these emissions are geographically concentrated—ten states make up 50 percent of US power sector emissions which are further concentrated in specific communities with large fossil-fuel power plants.3 Other emissions reductions depend on deploying a few key technologies (such as electric vehicles and heat pumps) at scale across communities. Crucially much of the challenge lies in disadvantaged communities where effective solutions are needed for those who are marginalized and overburdened by climate change and pollution and who often lack access to finance and find many climate solutions unaffordable.4

As part of the response to this challenge Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will allocate $27 billion in Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding through the GHGRF for climate and environmental justice.5 As a complement to the broader IRA package this funding includes $20 billion in competitive grants to eligible nonprofit financing institutions to address finance-related barriers to reduce or avoid GHG emissions (and other forms of air pollution) and to assist community efforts toward this goal through financial and technical assistance. At least $8 billion of the $20 billion in GHGRF funding is required to support low-income and disadvantaged communities which face large unmet financing needs and lower access to capital and financial services. Recipients either new or existing nonprofit organizations can deliver financing directly or in partnership with intermediaries—the United States has a network of more than 20 state and local green banks and more than 1300 community development financial organizations (CDFIs) focused on local lending and community development. The GHGRF also includes a further $7 billion set aside for states municipalities tribal governments or other recipients to deliver financing and support for zero-emission technologies.

GHGRF funding could play a pivotal role alongside the broader IRA in bending the curve toward an inclusive net-zero trajectory. Five key impact principles can help achieve this potential:

1. Focus on technologies and communities where the benefits are greatest

Achieving impact depends on targeting financing toward technologies and areas that deliver significant emissions reductions and outsize benefits to disadvantaged communities. This means breaking new ground to deliver opportunities that achieve both emissions reductions and environmental justice and balancing between objectives where necessary. It may be challenging to maximize all goals for GHGRF funding in all investments but by targeting these multiple goals in aggregate the funding can support high impact.

Targeting financing toward technologies and geographies with the greatest potential for emissions reduction. This might mean focusing on region-specific challenges such as decarbonizing older buildings in the Northeast or coal-dependent power production in the Northeast and Midwest. It might include a focus on technologies such as transportation electrification that enable sectorwide transformation and are needed across the country. It might also include a focus on coordinating and enabling cross-state projects such as transmission lines that are critical to the deployment of renewables which are difficult to manage and may particularly benefit from at-scale capital. 6

Targeting support toward disadvantaged communities that have been most burdened by climate change face specific investment challenges or have been particularly underserved by traditional financial institutions.7 This could include explicit allocation objectives; for example Cleveland’s GO Green Energy Fund targets low-income communities.8 It could also include the propagation of replicable investment models such as the Solar for All programs across US states that support low- and middle-income households installing solar power.9

2. Galvanize a distributed financing network

Effectively deploying priority technologies depends on leveraging local knowledge and expertise coordinating best practices and building publicly available resources to reach customers and accelerate demand. This includes coordinating an ecosystem that delivers technologies on the ground and customizing financing to local circumstances especially in disadvantaged communities.

Working directly or in partnership with local institutions and intermediaries that have established relationships with end customers and with supply chains to deliver effective investment. This may include local CDFIs alongside commercial financial institutions and businesses. This includes a range of interventions to build demand such as grants or other funding for customer engagement and awareness building. For example local green banks such as Michigan Saves and CDFIs such as Florida SELF have spent years building relationships with local contractor networks landowners and credit unions gaining community trust and helping drive deal flow.

Skills and knowledge building across these local ecosystems to increase their effectiveness through resources such as standardized green-financing procedures and documents replicable supplier agreements and common metrics and technology infrastructure to monitor and evaluate impact. For example the CDFI Fund provides technical assistance awards of up to $125000 to build the capacity of CDFIs through hiring training and other activities.10

3. Gain optimal leverage from GHGRF funding

Deploying initial funding with appropriate and responsible leverage can increase the overall capital deployed and its impact. Private cofinancing capital recycling and a well-balanced portfolio can all support catalyzing investment at greater scales. However obtaining the right balance of private sector leverage versus targeting additionality and targeting impact for beneficiaries will be important for achieving overall GHGRF goals. Optimal leverage will vary based on technology maturity community needs and the availability of complementary grant-based programs with lower leverage ratios likely when investing in less established technologies or disadvantaged communities. Approaches may also need to balance short-term private leverage against longer-term market catalyzation goals.

Co-investment and strategic use of risk-reducing instruments (such as guarantees) to directly crowd in private investment. This might include concessional terms for unsecured lending or underwriting real or perceived risks in the absence of a market track record. American green banks mobilized $1.7 billion in total clean-energy investments from $440 million of their own financing in 2020 alone. 11

Efficient capital management and securitization of loans (for sale to private partners) to free up capital for new lending. This includes capital management to minimize undeployed capital as well as support for aggregation and securitization of smaller loans. These activities also pave the way for future securitizations in that asset class when scale is reached. Examples include the Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority’s Green Energy Market Securitization Program which reduces the cost of clean-energy loans to consumers through a rate-reduction bond structure. 12

Balancing less risky investments against riskier ones within a portfolio to promote financial stability while also supporting high-risk technologies and disadvantaged communities. This could potentially enable debt issuance while also affording room for lower returns or higher losses in some segments of the portfolio. In one approach Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation has built a lending portfolio that includes commercial-rate senior loans whose proceeds are explicitly used to cross-subsidize other concessional-rate lending programs.13

4. Deploy a mix of financing vehicles flexibly to catalyze markets at scale

Achieving transformational impact means green bank financing and its leveraged cofinancing must address key constraints to investment. This requires a focus on investment approaches and specialized knowledge that are continually at the forefront removing the specific barriers to private financing – which can also leave behind the conditions for pure private financing in the future.

Financing approaches to remove technology-specific challenges such as technology performance risk construction and operational cost risks lack of liquidity and regulatory uncertainty and market immaturity. The United Kingdom’s Green Investment Bank invested in a series of offshore wind projects to tackle these risks at key stages in the deployment journey accelerating competitive private financing of the sector. 14

Approaches to overcome access to finance challenges for low-income groups—for example in relation to credit history lack of collateral mismatches between ability to pay and investment costs and small ticket size. Various state and local green banks support the rollout of residential solar panels with on-bill payments as opposed to traditional loans for example and they have used targeted funding to bring down the costs of technology or borrowing. 15

Systematic learning and flexibility in how financing is allocated to support reprioritization of investment toward approaches with the greatest demonstrated impact and where additional public support is most necessary. This also involves ending financing where the private sector has stepped in. For example the Connecticut Green Bank withdrew direct investment support for commercial property assessed clean energy (C-PACE) lending programs in 2015 as the market matured and private investors filled its role.16

5. Mobilize investment quickly

Given the scale and urgency of US plans to cut emissions by 50–52 percent by 2030 rapid deployment by recipients of funding would be needed to jump-start investment and the learning by doing that drives market transformation—while making sure not to leave behind communities that need more time to roll out investment at scale. Rapidly defining robust criteria and guidance for targeting and disbursing funds can support effective mobilization.

Initially focusing funding on more advanced technologies and on helping existing intermediaries fund established pipelines of projects. For example in its first year of operation the UK Infrastructure Bank established in 2021 initially focused on a mix of direct project lending and cornerstone investment in smaller funds that were ready to receive capital. In the United States alongside the broader IRA incentive programs green bank financing could potentially mobilize a large array of intermediaries including retailers with existing customer campaigns.

Offering funding commitments like lines of credit or conditional grants that rapidly enable a large number of partner intermediaries to advance financing opportunities without tying up capital before projects are ready for financing. Various multilateral development banks have built out finance facilities over the past two decades demonstrating the power of such facilities to mobilize a large network relatively quickly. For example the Green Economy Finance Facility of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development reaches more than 140 local financial institutions across 26 countries.17

Done well green bank financing can overcome critical barriers to investment unlocking the power of private finance at a scale well beyond the initial funding. Numerous examples demonstrate the feasibility of best practices and their outsize impact. By adhering to the above impact principles we believe GHGRF recipients can drive a system transformation. There is much experience to build upon an urgency to bring together the best of the best and more.

In early 2023 McKinsey will follow up on these principles with a quantitative assessment of the potential for GHGRF green bank financing to catalyze investments and support climate and environmental-justice objectives. The report will quantify the impact of this green bank financing across GHG emissions reductions job creation cost savings and health improvements for disadvantaged communities and for the United States as a whole.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will participate in a pilot test of a digital dollar to counter the challenge posed by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin by evaluating the rollout of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Citi HSBC Mastercard and Wells Fargo are among financial companies collaborating with the New York Fed’s Innovation Center in a 12-week proof-of-concept pilot using digital dollar tokens in a shared database to speed cross-border settlement in currency markets. The test will take place on a digital money platform known as the regulated liability network (RLN) using distributed ledger technology.

As part of the evaluation the project will explore the feasibility of a network of central bank wholesale digital money and commercial bank digital money on a shared multientity distributed ledger. According to the Fed the proof-of-concept will also test the feasibility of a programmable digital money design that may be extensible to other digital assets.

“The NYIC looks forward to collaborating with members of the banking community to advance research on asset tokenization and the future of financial market infrastructures in the US as money and banking evolve” Per von Zelowitz director of the New York Innovation Center said in a prepared statement.

The US lags behind other nations in developing a CBDC prompting critics to warn that the slow response could undermine US leadership in global financial markets. But the NY Fed cautions against interpreting the test as a shift in strategy.

“It is not intended to advance any specific policy outcome nor is it intended to signal that the Federal Reserve will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a retail or wholesale CBDC nor how one would necessarily be designed” the statement further noted.

The findings of the pilot project will be released after it concludes.

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An $800 Rental Bath Makeover Goes from “Drab” to Fab,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/drab-rental-bathroom-makeover-37397824 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvcnVnYnktdW5pb24vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3cwdmxlMW41cnJv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9ydWdieS11bmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy9jdzB2bGUxbjVycm8uYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Premiership: Newcastle Falcons 17-28 Bath,"It was a fast start by Bath who went over for the first time inside five minutes. Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvc3BvcnQuY29tL3J1Z2J5L2dhbGxhZ2hlci1wcmVtaWVyc2hpcC1zYWxlLWNsaW1iLWludG8tdG9wLWZvdXItd2l0aC1ib251cy1wb2ludC13aW4tb3Zlci1sZWljZXN0ZXItYmF0aC1icnVzaC1uZXdjYXNfc3RvMTAxMzk0NjIvc3Rvcnkuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gallagher Premiership: Sale beat Leicester to climb into top four Bath close in on playoffs with Newcastle win,"Sam James of Sale Sharks celebrates scoring a try during the Gallagher Premiership Rugby match between Sale Sharks and Leicester Tigers at AJ Bell Stadium on May 10 2024 in Salford England.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

The 48-year-old supermodel has always been defined by outré behavior. In 1992 after Calvin Klein made Moss the face of CK his offshoot brand she became the 90s’ most prominent party girl. Throughout the 2000s she was photographed leaving countless nightclubs and parties often it seemed under the influence of this or that.

In September 2005 when Moss was 31 a particular scandal threatened to permanently tarnish her career and legacy. A hidden camera caught Moss cutting and snorting lines of cocaine in a London recording studio—after she’d become a mother and claimed to have sworn off drugs—along with her then boyfriend Pete Doherty of the Libertines and his Babyshambles producer Mick Jones of the Clash. The photos appeared on the front page of the tabloid Daily Mirror. Brands including H&M Chanel and Burberry vowed to stop working with Moss.

And yet this ban only lasted a few months. She apologized went to rehab and by December was named the new face of Yves Saint Laurent’s Opium perfume and was put on the cover of French Vogue. The public seems to love Moss even more when she misbehaves.

Lila Grace Moss Hack and her mother Kate wore Burberry at this year’s Met Gala.

Over the years the model has withstood endless scandals and accusations that she’s an underfed-waif avatar and an outlaw influence for “heroin chic.” While she’s maintained her party-girl persona she’s also staged a new act: becoming a businesswoman. It’s not just part of the fun—Moss has had real success.

Unlike her fellow supermodels a sisterhood that regularly rises and falls like hemlines Moss is intent on cashing in on her resilient beauty and fame by doing more than continuing to pose and preen. This year Diet Coke named her its creative director. In September she launched Cosmoss a beauty line of skin-care and wellness products. Sure another celebrity-branded product launch is as rare as a yawn. More notably though she is the founder of Kate Moss Agency a talent agency she launched in 2016. Today it reports net assets of more than $3 million.

Comeback Kate

Modeling has always been trailed by a cloud of disrepute. The first fashion models were under-employed actors and the first modeling agency was started by one—John Robert Powers around 1923. Ever since then there have been agencies run by former models including Harry Conover Dorian Leigh Natalie Nickerson and Wilhelmina Cooper.

Kate Moss Agency (K.M.A.) forged in the furnace of 90s supermodel celebrity is unlike any of its predecessors. Never before has a top model launched a company under the white-hot light of international renown. Agencies have always been a post-modeling next step never a concurrent one.

Moss started her agency when she silently left her agent Sarah Doukas a model turned model manager and Storm Models after 27 years. Doukas discovered Moss in 1988 at age 14 in New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport where Moss and her travel-agent father had spent three days waiting for stand-by seats home to London. Her father was arguing with a desk agent when Doukas spotted her. Conveniently aboard the same plane Doukas rushed over to the Mosses the moment the fasten seat belts sign switched off. Kate joined Storm Models the very next day.

On November 10 Moss celebrated the 40th anniversary of Diet Coke at Annabel’s in London. Later that evening paparazzi caught her wardrobe malfunction.

“The falling-out was bad” one agency head says of Moss’s departure from Storm. But the scenario was likely not surprising. Says the owner of another agency “She got tired of paying commissions and she thought she could do a better job representing herself.” In her 40s she had already proved able to maintain her career beyond a typical model’s use-by date.

To start her own agency she teamed up with Camilla Johnson-Hill who bills herself amorphously as “a brand manager and producer” and later brought on Lucy Baxter a former booker at Storm and now K.M.A.’s chief booker. Moss announced her plan to make stars not mere models by combining traditional model management and image licensing with maternal care (“I don’t want the girls to feel insecure” she’s said) social-media strategies and multi-media partnerships. “It’s just giving [models] the chance to be creative” she has said vaguely.

Kate Moss “got tired of paying commissions and she thought she could do a better job representing herself.”

Baxter describes the company as a “small boutique” agency where Moss’s daughter Lila 20 and her childhood friend Stella Jones the 20-year-old daughter of Mick are two of only 19 models. Their careers are managed by the London-based firm’s handful of employees.

Kate’s past ironically is what gave her a big head start when she went out on her own: beyond Jones and Lila who like her mother started modeling at age 14 the agency roster is studded with children of her scandalous celebrity friends.

Lila and her childhood best friend Stella Jones at the 2021 Fashion Awards in London.

Elfie Reigate 22 the agency’s first client was a bridesmaid at Moss’s 2011 marriage to the Kills guitarist Jamie Hince. She’s the daughter of the artist Barry Reigate and Rosemary Ferguson a model turned nutritionist whom Moss counts among her best friends. K.M.A. also represents Ella Richards 26 the granddaughter of Rolling Stone Keith Richards. (Modeling’s current reckoning with allegations of industry-wide nepotism do not seem to have phased Moss or her agency neither of which has publicly addressed the matter.)

Since founding K.M.A. Moss has also poached big names from big agencies such as Stella Maxwell a successful former Victoria’s Secret model previously signed with Elite Models and Jordan Barrett a 26-year-old Australian with Bruce Weber–model looks. Barrett was discovered by the agency IMG which got him jobs with Versace Moschino and Tom Ford. He was briefly married to Fernando Casablancas a son of the late Elite founder John Casablancas. Kate and Lila Moss attended their Ibiza wedding where Mick Jagger’s daughter was best man and the page boy was a Guinness.

But Moss isn’t just selling celebrity spawn. Her agency is also about riding the culture’s edge. Several Moss models are what used to be called “exotics” men and women with striking non-traditional looks and attitudes well suited to this diversity-minded time. There’s ex–Storm Models face Georgia Palmer a multi-racial model who has posed for Versace Balmain and Miu Miu; Blondey McCoy a moody skater boy; and Esmé Creed-Miles the daughter of actress Sam Morton and Peaky Blinders actor Charlie Creed-Miles. (Esme is one of several models on the agency’s board even shorter than the 5-foot-7-inch-tall Moss.)

Small as it may be the agency punches above Moss’s waifish weight. Their models’ credits are a roll call of the most coveted brands such as Balmain Versace Miu Miu Yves Saint Laurent Burberry Louis Vuitton Valentino and Celine. After Moss and Baxter declined to be interviewed no one else in the business would respond on the record to requests for comment about the agency. The fashion world is not afraid of Kate it seems so much as they are determined that she be allowed to succeed.

It’s hard to say if Moss’s models are doing better or worse than they would have done without her but clearly her fiery glow reflects glory on them. “She’s gotten a lot of attention” says the owner of a big American modeling agency sounding a bit envious. K.M.A. is a respectable little business that has neither lit up nor burned down the modeling industry. “If she had a proper team she could scout and cash in” says the owner.

“You have to look at where she is in her life” he adds. “She’s probably made enough money.”

Take Advice From Warren Buffett,"Warren Buffett is a fount of financial wisdom and investors would do well to follow his advice.

Inflation crossed the 2% target in March 2021 and it kept rising but the Federal Reserve failed to take action for almost a full year insisting that transitory factors were to blame. That was a costly miscalculation in hindsight so the Fed is now trying to make up for lost time by raising interest rates at their fastest pace in four decades.

Unfortunately many experts believe central bank officials will tighten monetary policy too aggressively which could tip the U.S. economy into a recession. That fear has made the stock market sink like a stone this year. In fact the broad-based S&P 500 delivered its worst first-half performance since 1970 and the index has now declined for three consecutive quarters.

Given the uncertain state of the economy is it safe to invest in the stock market right now? Consider this advice from Warren Buffett.

""Be greedy when others are fearful.""

Buffett has turned his uncanny ability to pick winning stocks into a multibillion-dollar fortune and his success has inspired countless others. Investors pour over his shareholder letters each quarter in search of actionable insights and thousands of fans attend Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting each spring to hear his thoughts on business and the economy.

Buffett has undoubtedly provided a lot of good advice over the years but a few pearls of wisdom are particularly relevant right now. For instance in his 2013 letter to shareholders Buffett said ""A climate of fear is your friend when investing; a euphoric world is your enemy."" That statement hits on the irrationality of human nature. People get too optimistic in good times and too pessimistic in bad times. As a result the stock market flies too high during bull markets and sinks too low during bear markets.

However anyone who understands that quirk of human nature can use it to their advantage. To borrow a line from Buffett investors should ""be greedy when others are fearful."" That means right now is an excellent time to buy stocks. Many businesses that are brimming with long-term potential have seen their valuations slashed during the current downturn.

A long-term mindset increases the odds of profitability

In his 1993 letter to shareholders Buffett included a quote from his mentor Benjamin Graham: ""In the short run the market is a voting machine [...] but in the long run the market is a weighing machine."" That analogy explains the importance of a long-term mindset. Individual stocks can rise and fall without rhyme or reason in the short term but good businesses will create value for shareholders given enough time.

More broadly the entire stock market is prone to volatility when measured in weeks or months but investors who think in terms of years and decades are much more likely to profit. For instance the rolling 20-year return of the S&P 500 has been positive for the past 103 years according to Crestmont Research. In other words if you had bought and held an S&P 500 index fund for at least 20 years at any point in the past century you would have made money.

I will close with one last pearl from Buffett: ""A market downturn doesn't bother us. It is an opportunity to increase our ownership of great companies with great management at good prices.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2F0ZXJsYW5kYmxvZy5jb20vZXZlbnQva2VubmVkeS1jYXRob2xpYy1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1hcnRzLWNyYWZ0cy1mYWlyLXJldHVybnMtc2F0dXJkYXktZGVjLTMtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kennedy Catholic High School Arts & Crafts Fair returns Saturday Dec. 3,"SPONSORED :

A historic mortgage rate shock—with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate jumping from 3% to 6% this year—following the Pandemic Housing Boom’s 41.3% run-up in U.S. home prices in just over two years has simply pushed many would-be buyers to their breaking point. Other borrowers who must meet lenders’ strict debt-to-income ratios have lost mortgage eligibility altogether. That historic squeeze which comes from prices and rates is what Fortune calls “pressurized affordability.”

Already pressurized affordability has seen U.S. home prices as measured by the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index fall for the first time on a seasonal adjusted basis since 2012. In total U.S. home prices fell 2.2% between June 2022 and September 2022. That ties the second biggest home price correction of the post-World War II era.

Whenever a publication like Fortune says “U.S. homes prices” we’re talking about a national aggregate. Whatever comes next in the U.S. housing market will surely vary by market price point and home-type.

To get an idea of what might come next Fortune once again reached out to Moody’s Analytics to get their updated home price forecast (see map below) for 322 of the nation’s largest housing markets. (Here’s their previous metro-by-metro forecast).

Here’s what the data says.

Back in May Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told Fortune that the Federal Reserve's inflation fight would see the U.S. housing market slip into a ""housing correction."" At the time he expected home prices to flatline nationally and fall between 5% to 10% in ""significantly overvalued"" markets.

Zandi of course was right about the housing correction. That correction has actually been so sharp that Moody's Analytics in October once again lowered its national home price outlook. Peak-to-trough Zandi expects U.S. home prices to fall 10%. If a recession does manifest that outlook shifts down to a 20% peak-to-trough decline.

""No change in our outlook for [national] house prices or the mortgage rate. I am feeling more confident that the economy will be able to avoid a full-blown recession next year which is consistent with the 10% peak-to-trough decline in national house prices"" Zandi told Fortune on Friday. Through spring 2023 he expects mortgage rates to hover around 6.5%.

While Zandi expects around a 10% peak-to-trough home price decline nationally he expects it to vary regionally. In markets like Morristown Tenn. and Muskegon Mich. Moody's Analytics predicts home prices to fall 24.1% and 23.3% respectively. The firm expects markets like New York and Chicago to fall by 6.3% and 4.2% from peak-to-trough.

Heading forward Moody's Analytics expects ""significantly overvalued"" housing markets to see the sharpest declines. (You can find Moody's market-by-market overvaluation study here).

Look no further than markets like Boise and Flagstaff Ariz. Just weeks into the pandemic those markets got flooded with buyer interest from white-collar professionals working in high-cost cities like Seattle and San Francisco. While remote work was a game changer for those uprooted white-collar workers it didn't fundamentally change local incomes. So as the boom raged on Boise and Flagstaff became ""overvalued"" by 76.9% and 65.6%.

Fast-forward to 2022 and decelerating levels of migration means those boomtowns must rely more on local incomes. That'll be hard to do Zandi says. And for that reason Moody's forecast model expects home prices in markets like Boise and Flagstaff to drop over 20% from peak-to-trough.

While speaking at a Brookings Institute event on Tuesday Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the run-up in home prices during the Pandemic Housing Boom qualifies a ""housing bubble.""

“Coming out of the pandemic [mortgage] rates were very low people wanted to buy houses they wanted to get out of the cities and buy houses in the suburbs because of COVID. So you really had a housing bubble you had housing prices going up [at] very unsustainable levels and overheating and that kind of thing"" Powell said. ""So now the housing market will go through the other side of that and hopefully come out in a better place between supply and demand.""

The Pandemic Housing Boom did indeed see housing fundamentals get out-of-whack. According to Moody's Analytics the average U.S. housing market was ""overvalued"" by 1% in the second quarter of 2019. Through the second quarter of 2022 the average U.S. housing market was ""overvalued"" around 25%.

Heading forward Zandi doesn't expect a 2008-style financial crisis or foreclosure crisis but he does expect housing fundamentals to pull back towards the mean. Some of that moderation will come through rising incomes some of it will come through falling home prices.

""Before [home] prices began to decline we were overvalued [nationally] by around 25%. Now this means [home] prices will normalize. Affordability will be restored. The [housing] market won't be overvalued after this process is over"" Zandi says. ""It's all about affordability. First-time buyers are locked out of the market. They simply can't afford mortgage payments. Trade-up buyers won't sell and buy because it doesn't make any economic sense.""

Of course the home price correction has already arrived.

Just over half of the country's 400 biggest housing markets have seen local home values as measured by Zillow fall off their 2022 peak. The average decline being -2%.

The ongoing correction has hit two different types of markets the hardest: high-cost West Coast markets and ""bubbly"" boomtowns.

Even before the correction got into full-swing John Burns Real Estate Consulting told Fortune that high-cost West Coast markets were at higher risk of declining values. The reason being they're simply more rate sensitive. Markets like Seattle (down 6.3%) and Portland Ore. (down 5.1%) are hit by a double whammy: Not only are their high-end real estate markets more rate-sensitive but so are their tech sectors. There's also the fact that homebuilders and iBuyers—who are more likely to price down during a correction—make up a higher concentration of inventory out West.

The other group of markets who've been hit hard by the correction are bubbly markets. These markets which includes places like Austin (down 10.2%) and Boise (down 7.1%) saw their home values get detached from underlying fundamentals (i.e. local incomes) during the boom. And now they're seeing sharper pullbacks.

Warren Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway does not own Rolls-Royce (LSE:RR) shares. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a stock that meets his investment criteria.

Buffett has repeatedly said that investors should only own companies with a competitive edge. He buys when stocks are meaningfully undervalued but avoids distressed assets.

So let’s take a closer look at Rolls-Royce and explore why I think this stock would meet the legendary investor’s criteria.

A distressed asset?

Let’s start by assessing one reason why Rolls-Royce might not meet Buffett’s criteria. It’s not what you’d describe as a distressed asset but it certainly faces challenges.

Rolls has been working hard to pay off its debts and completed a £2bn sell-off of business units in September. These funds were used to pay down near-term debt. However Rolls still has £4bn in debt obligations — all on fixed-interest rate terms — between 2024-2028.

Revenue dropped substantially during the pandemic and it’s still not back at pre-pandemic levels. The company which gets paid when its engines are airborne said hours flown by its customers were now at 65% of 2019 pre-Covid levels.

It’s worth noting though that other firms do use debt to leverage greater revenue. And despite continued pandemic-induced disruption cash flow is once again positive.

Meaningfully undervalued?

In the summer Morgan Stanley analysts said shares in the engineering giant were “woefully mispriced” — at the time Rolls was trading for 88p.

The stock then tanked during the short but disastrous premiership of Liz Truss. With Rishi Sunak at the helm a more predictable macroeconomic environment and a recent positive earnings update the share price has jumped 30% in a month — back to 90p.

There are metrics to support the notion that Rolls is still undervalued. It trades with an enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 1.11 versus a sector average of 1.72. Meanwhile the enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is in line with the sector median. Other metrics also suggest the firm is trading at a discount to its peers in the industrials sector.

Competitive edge

Rolls-Royce is synonymous with quality. And that’s important as the sectors the company operates in — aviation defence and power systems — put a premium on quality.

The firm is a market leader in aviation particularly in the provision of engines used on long-haul flights. It’s not the type of market where customers are willing to skimp on quality to get a better price. Rolls is also at the cutting edge of efficiency — its UltraFan demonstrator aero engine is 25% more fuel efficient than the first Trent engine models.

The firm is also responsible for maintaining and developing the UK’s nuclear submarine fleet — there aren’t too many competitors here and nuclear tech is closely guarded. In many respects this provides Rolls with defensive characteristics.

So while Buffett might not own Rolls stock I think it could meet the billionaire investor’s criteria. It’s also worth noting that Rolls-Royce is down 63% over three years (-33% over one year). But despite the £2bn in business unit sales the company isn’t substantially smaller. In fact remaining business units are demonstrating strong growth.

I already own Rolls-Royce stock and I’m looking to buy more this year."

His story has attracted over 6 million views on Tiktok.

TikTok user Dallas (@dallas_ponzo) shares stories with his followers from working behind the desk at Best Buy. He often narrates a voice-over that plays while he soothingly applies screen protectors to devices.

In the viral video Dallas recounts how a man recently came into the store and asked to do a simple upgrade to his AT&T account. But the TikToker’s suspicions were raised when the customer asked to upgrade five lines to the iPhone Pro 13 Max — one of the latest iPhone models with one of the most expensive plans currently available at Best Buy.

A purchase of that size automatically set off the TikToker’s alarm bells. However he continued with the transaction as there was no reason to immediately flag it as a scam.

“There’s nothing I can do until I prove that he’s doing it fraudulently” Dallas says in the video.

The TikToker continues to say that the first two iPhones were purchased without a problem. It was during the process for the third phone that the customer was flagged for a “credit check.”

According to Dallas the customer began freaking out but the TikToker informed him that such measures were routine for large purchases.

“Actually it’s pretty common especially when you’re doing a lot of upgrades at once. They just want to prove that it’s actually you buying the phones” he allegedly told the customer.

Dallas continues to say that after only 2 minutes of waiting on the phone with AT&T for the credit check the customer changed his mind saying he would just go to AT&T directly. The TikToker informed the customer that he would have to complete the same process there as well.

The customer left soon after making the TikToker believe that the transaction was a scam from the start.

Some users pointed out that there was nothing inherently fraudulent about the interaction.

“Maybe he didn’t anticipate a credit check and is trying to keep his credit report clean” one user wrote.

“I mean it could be fraudulent but nothing you mentioned stated it was fraudulent just the guy was impatient” a second stated.

However other users doubled down on the claim that the interaction was a potential scam.

“They think these huge companies just going to let you rob them for 5k” one user commented.

Eufy Security has attracted attention in the security camera world recently for cybersecurity flaws with some users saying Eufy has misled consumers by uploading local-only data to cloud servers without user knowledge and pointing out holes in video data security that enable remote access to Eufy cameras' livestreams using VLC player.

These claims come with unfortunate timing as the technology company just launched a series of security devices to end the year.

The price though steep is worth it.

One of these new launches the EufyCam 3 and HomeBase 3 bundle also known as the Eufy Edge Security System seems to gather all the best features of competing security cameras and combine them into one kit. With 4K-quality images forever power and expandable storage all with no monthly fees those flaws may not seem important.

Home security is a big deal to me. Growing up in a developing country I've heard my fair share of crime and break-in stories from family and friends. But break-in stories anywhere are enough to instill fear in anyone.

For years I wanted to lock my house down like a prison with locks and alarms everywhere. Now that I am older wiser and have a family of my own to protect I've set up my home security just how I like it and thankfully my house isn't like a prison.

I was able to do this with Eufy Security. An electronics brand by Chinese company Anker Innovations Eufy makes home security cameras sensors keypads and pretty much everything you need to set up your own customized home security system. I went with some motion sensors cameras a Eufy keypad a video doorbell a smart lock and a HomeBase 2.

The new Eufy Edge Security System

Eufy's new Edge Security System has two EufyCam 3 cameras -- bullet-shaped and completely wireless using built-in solar panels at the top of them -- and a HomeBase 3 an artificially intelligent hub for all Eufy Security devices that features facial recognition with 16GB of built-in local storage space expandable to up to 16TB and works as your home security alarm.

Straight out of the box you get two EufyCam 3 outdoor cameras the HomeBase 3 one Ethernet cable to connect the HomeBase 3 a 12V adapter for the hub a USB-C cable to charge your security cameras two screw-mounting bases a quick-start guide and sticker and the mounting hardware which consists of screw packs screw positioning stickers and a metal pin for resets.

This kit by itself can work as a standalone security system. I mounted one camera where it can cover my driveway and front yard and the other covering the backyard and back door. The HomeBase 3 supposedly keeps all recordings inside our home and the motion detection notifications flow in seamlessly.

It's also already learned to recognize my and my partner's faces so when either of us takes the dog out in the backyard it tells us which one was detected.

Also: The best outdoor security cameras

I like being in control of my surroundings; whether that's healthy or not is a topic for another day. Customizable and DIY security systems bring the control back to you so you can install your motion sensors exactly where you want them.

These systems however tend to come with the downside that they're more prone to cybersecurity flaws. There are some claims that Eufy camera feeds can be accessed remotely using VLC player no encryption or authentication required. Eufy hasn't officially responded to this claim as of yet and we reached out to the company for comment and have yet to receive an answer.

Video quality

The EufyCam 3 is a 4K-resolution security camera that blows all of the other ones I've personally used out of the water. This completely wireless security camera captures a clear and colorful picture during the day one that lets you easily discern facial features and letters and numbers like those of a license plate for example.

This is the EufyCam 3 that overlooks my backyard. Maria Diaz/ZDNET

I've used many security cameras in the past with varying resolution quality. So when a security camera claims to offer 2K or higher resolution I want to see if it's actually going to be a good picture. And in this case it is; the picture quality is outstanding -- I simply can't ding Eufy on this.

Even at night when the EufyCam 3 has the option to turn on a spotlight to record color night vision or do infrared night vision the picture quality is pretty great for both. I prefer color night vision: It means the spotlight on the camera comes on when movement is detected which makes for both a better picture with less ghosting and acts as a potential deterrent.

The color night vision is pretty clear -- pardon our resident spider's web in front of the camera. Maria Diaz/ZDNET

The security cameras also have anti-theft detection which is triggered when someone tries to pull them off or in my case a crow tries to stand on it. The anti-theft alarm comes from the HomeBase 3 so you'll always hear it if it's triggered by someone outside and it's also visible on a mobile notification from the Eufy Security app.

Though the angle is slightly different the picture quality on the EufyCam 3 (left) is pretty remarkable for a security camera. Maria Diaz/ZDNET

The EufyCam 3 and HomeBase 3 security camera system isn't compatible with Apple HomeKit at this time but it is compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant like my current Eufy Security video doorbell. Asking Alexa to show me the driveway cam on my little Echo Show comes in handy.

No subscription fees

I don't like subscription fees on top of any of the products I buy; it's a hill I'm prepared to die on. And a camera with a subscription fee is one of the most illogical things to me. If I'm already spending $100 to $250 on a great camera why on Earth would I have to pay a monthly fee to use it?

The HomeBase 3 is much more than just a hub for your Eufy Security cameras. Eufy Security

This is the main reason we chose Eufy for our home security system and it's one of the two ways the HomeBase 3 excels: Inside your home connected via Ethernet it stores the video captured by the security cameras outside without the need to pay for cloud storage and it doubles as an alarm.

Though it comes with 16GB of local storage the HomeBase 3 features an expansion bay that can hold a HDD or SSD for up to 16TB of video storage no cloud storage necessary.

Also: SSD vs HDD: What's the difference and which should you buy?

Don't forget however that Eufy is facing its own issues with security: Though the company says the footage is kept local it's been said to send video thumbnails photos of the people detected and identifier data to AWS cloud servers. Eufy claims this doesn't happen with the HomeBase 3 thanks to a high-performing database that stores the data within the hub.

An area where the HomeBase 3 does excel is its BionicMind AI technology. This makes it so the hub can intelligently learn the different faces of different people and recognize who's coming and going. For our home I added a photo of myself on the Eufy Security app and the system started recognizing me after a handful of sightings. (The facial recognition technology does however make me leery of this data being uploaded to cloud servers without our consent.)

The system recognizes people and intelligently identifies them with a saved identity or flags them as strangers. Eufy Security

I wanted to see how the AI performed with other household members so I didn't initially add my partner and for security concerns decided to skip my kids altogether. The system flagged my husband as a ""stranger"" and took snapshots of about 34 different angles and expressions of his face and and 30 of his body to learn to recognize him. Before I added a name for him in the Edge Security System it had intelligently grouped all these sightings into the same stranger.

I find the BionicMind AI technology to be pretty useful especially when I get those midnight alerts that someone has been spotted. Seeing my husband's name on the notification gives me peace of mind knowing it's not a stranger prowling the backyard at midnight but rather him taking the puppy out.

Something I didn't care for when switching from our HomeBase 2 to the new HomeBase 3 was that we had to unpair our old devices and individually add them which made it so we slacked on it for a good while. It's the kind of thing that you want to be able to do seamlessly with the mobile app when you upgrade your hub and it'd be awesome to just have a pop-up appear asking to add these devices to the new HomeBase 3.

Forever power

The wireless security camera that the new Edge Security System includes two of the S330 EufyCam has an integrated solar panel at the top and a USB-C port at the back for charging. After I plugged my two EufyCams in for an initial charge I found the best places to install them.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

My house faces north so figuring out where to install the cameras so that they would get enough visibility over the coverage area and where they'd receive enough solar power was a challenge especially going into the winter months.

The goal is for the cameras to achieve ""forever power"" where a couple of hours of direct sunlight are enough to maintain the battery life. I haven't had to charge the cameras since the initial charge almost two months ago and I've only seen a significant decrease in battery on our driveway camera.

The EufyCam 3 that looks over my driveway is always monitoring comings and goings by us approaching vehicles and Amazon delivery drivers so it gets a lot of use. Combine that with rainy and foggy fall mornings and it creates a perfect storm for battery depletion. Even then the 12400-mAh battery on that S330 EufyCam is still at 58% with 52 days of use and 2431 detected events.

You can set the EufyCam 3 to run on Optimal Battery Life where it records up to 20 seconds of video and adjusts detection time to avoid recording the same object twice in a short period of time or on Optimal Surveillance which is what I keep it on. With optimal surveillance videos can be up to 60 seconds long and the system tries to record each event as long as possible. You can also customize clip length and detection periods.

The Eufy Security app also shows you when the EufyCam 3s are charging via sunlight which is pretty neat to see in real time and it also features a Solar Dashboard. This option shows you how your camera's battery percentage has trended over time as well as Beta features like how many mAh of energy it received per day and what the solar charging efficiency looks like.

Bottom line: Is the Edge Security System really enough for home security?

The Eufy Edge Security System aka the EufyCam 3 and HomeBase 3 bundle retails for $550. This is pretty on par when you compare it with brands like Arlo and even Ring for example. But home automation tinkerers may sniff at the price tag when you can get other security cameras for less than $100 or $50 individually.

Also: I tried Roku's new line of low-cost smart home products. There's only one minor drawback

Here's my view: The price though steep is worth it. Listen I'm known to be the cheapest person in my family always looking for deals and the best ways to make my home do what I want for less so $550 is not an amount I take lightly. But the price is worth it.

When setting up home security many people buy several motion sensors indoor and outdoor cameras alarm systems entry sensors and so on and can end up spending around the price of this system or more. These two 4K-resolution outdoor wireless S330 EufyCams can be placed strategically to surveil your home's front and back entrances so you'll know if an intruder is spotted before they even try to make entry.

Then the HomeBase 3 intelligently identifies who or what was on camera and locally stores the video from these events without your having to pay monthly fees for your home protection. Keeping in mind the privacy risks associated with Eufy storing some things on the cloud I prefer to keep my EufyCams outside my home. (Many other security cameras store data on the cloud so that's not inherently a bad thing. It's a problem if a company does so without letting its users know. Anker Electronics Eufy's parent company has spoken on how it plans to address concerns about Eufy's data security going forward.)

The HomeBase 3 can also be set up so an alarm goes off inside your home when the EufyCam 3 outside detects movement with highly customizable options for what actions to take such as sending notifications and keeping video recordings.

All in all this really can be a standalone home security system; anything else you add to it is for your own peace of mind.

FAQ

Is the HomeBase 3 compatible with older Eufy Security cameras? At this time Eufy Security is working to expand compatibility with the HomeBase 3. When the new hub launched in September 2022 it was compatible with all EufyCam models the battery doorbell and motion sensors.

My trusty Eufy Security battery video doorbell Maria Diaz/ZDNET

A firmware upgrade will make the rest of the Eufy Security product lineup including existing Eufy cameras compatible with the HomeBase 3 by the end of 2022; with the only exception being the wired doorbell planned to be compatible in the beginning of 2023.

Are there alternatives to the Eufy Edge Security system worth considering? There are a lot of security camera systems on the market though few compare to the HomeBase 3 and EufyCam 3 in resolution reliability and local storage. These are some of the best alternatives to this system with variations for monthly subscriptions or video quality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25zdW1lcnJlcG9ydHMub3JnL2hvbWUtZ2FyZGVuL2Fpci1tYXR0cmVzc2VzL2Jlc3QtYW5kLXdvcnN0LWFpci1tYXR0cmVzc2VzLWZyb20tY29uc3VtZXItcmVwb3J0cy10ZXN0cy1hNzM2ODkzMzQzNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best and Worst Air Mattresses,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25zdW1lcnJlcG9ydHMub3JnL2hvbWUtZ2FyZGVuL2Fpci1tYXR0cmVzc2VzL2Jlc3QtYW5kLXdvcnN0LWFpci1tYXR0cmVzc2VzLWZyb20tY29uc3VtZXItcmVwb3J0cy10ZXN0cy1hNzM2ODkzMzQzNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C492602110>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Cramer's market predictions and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks According To Jim Cramer.

The investing landscape has widely transformed this year as recession fears pull investors toward previously overlooked defensive securities. Jim Cramer the host of Mad Money on CNBC advises investors to invest in profitable companies that have strong shareholder returns. In addition to this he also talked about loading up on high-yielding dividend stocks in one of his shows recorded in late September.

In one of his recent shows in October Cramer mentioned that tech stocks have fallen this year because of the tightening monetary policy. However the decline in tech stocks opens new investment avenues for investors where they can take refuge in other sectors. According to Cramer some of the industries that investors should focus on include fossil fuels healthcare travel defense and food and beverage.

According to Cramer the continuous interest rate hikes this year indicate that the trend will likely continue for the rest of the year. This eventually increases the risks of a possible recession. He further mentioned that though the rapidly rising treasury yields have put pressure on dividend stocks they still offer better investment opportunities than the rest of the market. He mentioned that investors should steadily build their position in dividends to gain maximum profits.

Dividend stocks are becoming increasingly popular among investors this year as many companies reinstated and raised their payouts after the pandemic of 2020. According to the third quarter report of the S&P Dow Jones Indices cash dividends within the S&P 500 set record payments in Q3 and saw an 8.5% growth from the same period last year. The report also highlighted that dividends are expected to reach their record by the next quarter. Some of the most popular dividend stocks include Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) as they have raised their dividends for a long time.

In view of the above-stated arguments and to further expand upon Cramer’s investment strategy we will discuss the best dividend stocks according to Jim Cramer.

The development of biotherapeutics however carries specific contamination concerns. All biotherapeutics whether originating from patient cells or developed in cell lines from bacteria yeast plants insects humans or other animals must be free of contaminants such as mycoplasma for safety reasons. Additionally cell-line derived biotherapeutics such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) therapeutics must be free from host cell contamination.

Mycoplasma is a relatively common insidious cell culture contaminant that is problematic for any research lab due to subtle impacts on cell function and responses. It is particularly problematic for cell-based vaccines biologics and gene therapies and potentially shuts down labs. In addition several species are pathogenic—contaminated products can trigger infections in patients and even non-pathogenic species may cause infections in immunocompromised individuals.

Residual host cell contamination forms a major concern for many biotherapeutics. DNA from host cells is systematically removed from products but complete DNA extraction can be difficult with removal efficacy dependent on DNA concentrations and matrix conditions. As a result trace amounts of host cell DNA typically remain. The presence of residual host cell DNA in products carries multiple potential health risks from infection to effects on genomic expression or oncogenic events in the case of immortalized cell lines.

In addition to the health risks posed by contaminants releasing a contaminated product would have severe consequences for the responsible lab likely resulting in shutdowns major losses and/or irreparable damage to the organization’s reputation.

Allowable limits for contaminants including Mycoplasma and residual host cell DNA are set by relevant regulatory agencies like the World Health Organization the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Pharmacopeia. For therapeutics derived from human immortalized cell lines like HeLa and HEK293 the guidance calls for residual DNA fragment lengths of less than or equal to 200 bp—below functional gene length—and under 10 ng per dose. Challenges arise from attempting to measure these tiny fragments and trace concentrations with the accuracy and precision required of regulated labs.

The struggles with the status quo

The most commonly used solutions for determining the presence of or quantifying contaminants namely culture tests qPCR and DNA quantification/qualification platforms like the BioAnalyzer are limited in their speed sensitivity or accuracy at the scales required by current regulations.

Traditional culture-based tests are still considered by many to be the gold standard for Mycoplasma detection but take 28 days to obtain results. This is too long to wait for many applications in medicine pharmaceuticals and biotech resulting in lengthy research delays production delays or late-stage mitigation strategies that culminate in considerable losses.

Both Mycoplasma and host cell contamination can be detected using qPCR a technique that has grown in popularity over the last couple of decades. Results are obtained much faster than with cultures and the test is specific and moderately sensitive.

However qPCR has a few limitations that affect its suitability for detecting trace contaminants. It has a high false-positive rate for Mycosplasma which triggers unnecessary losses. Second quantifying DNA at the levels expected in a finished product is challenging with poor resolution for low input DNA concentration (10 copies or less) and size (under 200 bp). Depending on the thresholds set for quantification cycles trace levels of contaminating DNA may not trigger a positive hit. Accurate quantification is difficult to achieve as the data is qualitative without a standard curve. Additionally some of the more popular assays generate non-specific signals.

BioAnalyzers are also frequently used to look for host cell contamination as an inexpensive rapid and easy test. This analysis can’t differentiate between species present though instead quantifying total DNA in the sample. Accuracy is also low for small fragment sizes and low concentrations. Conversely it won’t analyze high molecular weight DNA (greater than seven kb).

The need remains for accurate reliable and affordable detection and sizing of contaminating DNA that meets current regulatory standards.

Improving sensitivity and accuracy with ddPCR

Droplet Digital™ PCR (ddPCR) testing offers a few advantages over traditional formats including increased accuracy resolution and specificity. With this technique samples are partitioned into water-oil emulsion nanoliter droplets and the presence or absence of target DNA is recorded for each droplet. The starting concentration is then calculated using a Poisson distribution based on the proportion of negative droplets. This nanoscale presence/absence approach avoids issues with amplification bias or instrument variability that typically affect PCR.

Several additional benefits of ddPCR make it an ideal solution for mycoplasma and host cell DNA contamination testing. It offers higher sensitivity and specificity with a low false-positive rate minimizing unnecessary losses and set-backs. Quantification of DNA measured to femtograms and reported as the number of genome copies per reaction is accurate and precise regardless of fragment size and without the need for standard curves. Workflows are also fast and simple with high throughput. Partitioning limits the effects of inhibitors within complex intermediates so diluted samples can be input directly without DNA extraction steps minimizing handling additional steps and variables and maximizing recovery. This also makes ddPCR technology an effective solution for all types of samples generated across development and manufacturing processes.

Existing ddPCR kits offered by Bio-Rad cover testing for key cell and gene therapy contaminants including HEK293 residual DNA sizing and quantification CHO and E. coli residual DNA quantification and Mycoplasma detection. The Mycoplasma kit can detect 112 species with low cross-reactivity and makes direct calculation of GC: CFU (genome copies to colony forming units) easy with reported genomic copies per reaction. The HEK293 kits have high specificity (99.8 percent for quantification and 95 percent for sizing) and sizing provides the median fragment lengths and confidence intervals without reference curves. The reagents by Bio-Rad are also guaranteed free of DNA contaminants.

Support for regulatory adherence is critical in any methods used to determine or quantify contaminants in biotherapeutics. Bio-Rad’s solutions include software tools that assist with compliance with U.S. FDA 21 CFR Part 11 regulations including the generation of audit trails with tracked protocol changes when using ddPCR instruments. In addition auto-gating and auto-thresholding features in the software help minimize data handling and interpretation.

Inside his shirt pocket he had hidden a small audio recorder that authorities hoped would capture incriminating evidence.

His relationship with Tony Kingsley he says had soured after Bawduniak balked at what he describes as an increasingly brazen scheme to give doctors millions of dollars in kickbacks to prescribe Biogen’s lucrative multiple sclerosis drugs. But he had more on his mind that day in early 2012 than his bleak future at Biogen.

Michael Bawduniak’s heart was racing when the Biogen marketing manager met with his boss at the drug firm’s headquarters in Weston.

“Because of my refusal to perform noncompliant activities” he recalled telling Kingsley “my career here is ruined.” Kingsley who ran commercial operations as executive vice president of the Fortune 500 company changed the subject. Bawduniak wondered whether he suspected he was being taped.

Bawduniak recorded 11 conversations with Biogen executives for the FBI that winter he says and Kingsley was the highest ranking. But federal prosecutors opted not to pursue a criminal case.

Ten years later however Bawduniak feels vindicated.

He received $266.4 million last month as a result of a federal whistle-blower lawsuit he filed in 2012 against Biogen now based in Cambridge. The money is part of $900 million that the firm paid the federal government and 15 states to settle the civil case. His award is the largest in a whistle-blower suit on record according to his lawyer Thomas M. Greene of Boston who declined to disclose how much he was paid out of the settlement.

The suit alleged that Biogen paid hundreds of doctors for sham speaking and consulting programs that were actually kickbacks and defrauded Medicare and Medicaid which covered the drugs the physicians prescribed. Federal law allows a private citizen to sue for fraud on behalf of the government and if successful obtain part of the award. Biogen’s settlement and Bawduniak’s cut were finalized on Sept. 26.

Now in his first interview since the announcement Bawduniak said he never expected such a staggering windfall. He didn’t even inform his wife he had filed the suit for roughly two years because he didn’t want to worry her and only told his two adult sons last Christmas nine years after litigation started.

The son of a pharmaceutical executive and a registered nurse he said he had loved working in the drug industry and knew the suit would ultimately end his career regardless of its outcome. Nonetheless Bawduniak said he couldn’t stomach how Biogen allegedly spent millions to woo doctors to prescribe Avonex Tysabri and Tecfidera instead of drugs by rival companies.

“It went from dabbling in a gray area to jumping both feet across the line” said Bawduniak 56 who has lived in the Philadelphia area all his life and would stay at hotels for a couple of weeks a month when working on site at Biogen. He filed the suit in April 2012 two months before he left Biogen to work for the French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi in the United States.

The day the settlement was finalized Biogen denied it did anything wrong and noted that it had not admitted to any liability. The firm said it settled to “remain focused on our patients and strategic priorities.” Biogen recently told the Globe it had nothing to add to that statement.

Kingsley now chief executive of the privately held New York City-based biotech Stablix said he didn’t learn that Bawduniak taped him until many years later and was “quite surprised.” He denied Bawduniak’s allegations that Kingsley orchestrated payoffs to doctors.

“I am not aware of any kickback scheme while I was at Biogen” Kingsley who left the firm in late 2015 said last month in a Globe interview.

Although accusations of payoffs have buffeted the pharmaceutical industry for decades Biogen’s purported scheme was unusual because of its breadth and brazenness according to Jacob Elberg a former federal prosecutor in New Jersey and health care fraud expert who teaches at Seton Hall Law School.

“It’s a matter of degree” said Elberg. “The conduct alleged is the kind of thing that was much more common in the industry 20 years ago and is really many of us like to believe much less common in the industry now.”

From 2009 to 2014 Biogen held 255 illegitimate meetings with doctors who were high prescribers — the firm called them “key opinion leaders” — of its multiple sclerosis drugs according to Bawduniak’s trial brief. Biogen fêted doctors at pricey steakhouses and country clubs; provided free annual trips to San Diego for as many as 200 doctors some of whom played at the renowned Torrey Pines Golf Course; and paid prescribers millions of dollars in honoraria — all under the guise of soliciting “consultant feedback.” It was Bawduniak’s job to help set up events.

The alleged scheme targeted 1200 doctors who wrote 60 percent of the prescriptions for Biogen’s “immune modulating drugs” according to the trial brief. Multiple sclerosis patients often begin taking those medicines as relatively young adults and use them for the rest of their lives. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease of the brain and spinal cord in which the body’s immune system attacks the protective sheath covering nerve fibers.

The annual cost of Avonex Tysabri and Tecfidera ranged from $62394 to $64233 in 2013 according to a study published two years later in the journal Neurology. The drugs remain on the market.

Bawduniak had worked for two other makers of multiple sclerosis drugs before he joined Biogen in 2004 and noted that allegations of kickbacks weren’t unique to the Massachusetts biotech. His prior employer EMD Serono and its affiliates paid $44.3 million in 2011 to settle allegations they paid off doctors from 2002 through 2009 to prescribe Rebif another medicine for the disease.

But after Kingsley arrived in 2010 and a major competitor Swiss drug giant Novartis prepared to roll out the first multiple sclerosis drug in a capsule Biogen got more audacious in defending its market share Bawduniak said. He was directed to fill in a spreadsheet of the 50 top prescribers of Biogen’s drugs who were most at risk for switching to Novartis’s new medicine Gilenya and to indicate how Bawduniak’s team intended to woo them — to document planned payoffs in Bawduniak’s view.

“I just said ‘This isn’t a good idea. I’m not going to do it’” he said. He went to his firm’s compliance department which backed him up he said but continued to get pressure to do it and refused.

In 2011 Bawduniak said he received the lowest possible performance evaluation and was demoted from his job as an interim marketing director.

Around that time he said he contacted Greene. The lawyer has represented multiple whistle-blowers who have sued corporations under the False Claims Act the federal law passed during the Civil War to fight fraud by suppliers to the Union Army.

Greene helped arrange a meeting with federal prosecutors who were interested in whether Biogen might have broken criminal laws. FBI agents got Bawduniak to tape conversations with employees in person and on the phone in early 2012. After Bawduniak taped Kingsley he drove to a nearby Westin Hotel to hand the recorder to an agent.

“I was under a great deal of stress and paranoia” Bawduniak recalled. “I thought everyone knew I was taping.”

But prosecutors did not pursue a criminal case. A spokeswoman for Rachael S. Rollins who was confirmed as US attorney for Massachusetts last December declined to explain why saying “We do not comment on internal deliberative processes.”

Reuben Guttman a whistle-blower lawyer in Washington D.C. who helped the government obtain large settlements in cases involving criminal and civil allegations against Pfizer in 2009 and Abbott Laboratories in 2012 said he was surprised prosecutors didn’t pursue criminal charges against Biogen. But he noted that criminal cases have a higher burden of proof than civil cases.

Not long after the government’s decision Bawduniak filed his suit. It was kept under seal for more than three years while the government decided whether to “intervene” or take it over. Whistle-blower suits lead to settlements more often if the government takes over cases but prosecutors intervene less than 25 percent of the time according to veteran whistle-blower lawyers. In July 2015 the government opted not to intervene — Rollins’s spokeswoman again declined to say why — letting Bawduniak’s team of seven attorneys pursue it on its own.

The case was then unsealed and Bawduniak’s name made public. The timing he said couldn’t have been worse. He was working as a regional business director at Sanofi and had a performance evaluation scheduled with his supervisor at a Nashville hotel.

Bawduniak entered the hotel restaurant and spotted the supervisor staring at his open laptop at a table. After Bawduniak walked over he said the supervisor turned the screen to face him. It was a news story reporting that Bawduniak had blown the whistle on Biogen.

“Do you care to tell me what this is all about?” the Sanofi supervisor said according to Bawduniak.

“It speaks for itself” Bawduniak replied.

“Well everyone at the home office has seen this” he said the supervisor responded. “No one trusts you any longer. I don’t trust you any longer.”

A Sanofi spokeswoman said the company had no comment.

Bawduniak stayed at Sanofi however. That firm also makes multiple sclerosis drugs and hired several former Biogen employees while he worked there he said. Occasionally he would bump into them at meetings and they would ignore him.

“People like myself are an anomaly” he said. “Doing the right thing isn’t always held in the highest of esteem because usually it reveals the wrongdoing of other people.”

A tentative settlement with Biogen was announced on July 26 six days before the case was to go to trial in US District Court in Boston. Under the agreement Biogen paid $843.8 million to the federal government and $56.2 million to 15 states.

The alleged fraud caused government insurers to pay $640.1 million to $951.7 million for medications that were prescribed as a result of kickbacks according to Meredith Rosenthal a health economics professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health hired by Bawduniak to calculate damages.

These days Bawduniak won’t say whether he plans to stay at Sanofi. The nonprofit Taxpayers Against Fraud honored him in October as the Whistleblower of the Year in Washington D.C. He said he might get more involved in the group.

As for his newfound fortune Bawduniak said he has no desire to buy anything extravagant.

“I have no plans for mansions and yachts” he said. “I’m a simple guy.”

Antoine Papiernik Sofinnova chairman and managing partner speaks with Global Finance about the state of life sciences today and in future.





Global Finance: How are macro conditions such as interest rates impacting your work?

Antoine Papiernik: Interest rates do not directly impact our industry because the cost of goods of those products is a small fraction of the value of the product. What is impacting us instead is the Inflation Reduction Act [a 2022 US law that includes a cap on drug costs and spending] for reasons that are not directly linked to inflation. The Inflation Reduction Act reduces the overall time that a pharma or biotech company can market their products before prices are pushed down.

Today valuations are low. If you take the 1000 Nasdaq-listed companies in biotech they have lost half a trillion in market capitalization. Yes it is a big deal but that’s the same amount of market cap evaporation that a company like META experienced. To put things in perspective: If these 1000 companies manage to survive the number of products that ultimately are going to really create something fabulous and save people’s lives will be huge.

GF: What is the current environment for life sciences IPOs?

Papiernik: Now it’s the ice age for IPOs. There are no IPOs at all. And that’s a problem because companies need to get funded. My job is to transform our clients’ cash into performance. I need to be able to do that either through the sale of stocks on the stock market or selling [a company] to a big pharmceutical player. Right now this creates a ceiling to an industry because you cannot take a company public.

GF: How does climate change impact your vision or your investing?

Papiernik: There are so many things today that you wouldn’t know that are extracted from petroleum. It’s scary but that’s what it is and this must change to reach net-zero. If you look at our portfolio we have about 25 companies in that field I am always so impressed with what these people produce. I spent my career funding people who are developing new drugs to treat patients but saving the planet is also important. Fortunately people have now caught on to the fact that it’s important and that biotechnology can support fighting climate change.

GF: What’s the dynamic between startups and big players in this field?

Papiernik: I think the industry has changed a lot over the last few decades. Of all the products that are being brought to the FDA in the US the great majority—70% to 75%—comes from small innovative biotech companies and some of them have then been acquired. But the old model—where pharma was doing research with a big R&D team and looking at biotech as a cute little thing on the side—is gone. The bigger players completely understood that they need the smaller biotechs and for that reason the relationship is not big pharma versus small biotech anymore.",,,,,,,,,

Nelson will take up the role as president of Boeing international from 12 January 2023 taking over from Michael Arthur who is retiring after eight years with the company says Boeing.

Nelson will be on the second non-American citizen to lead Boeing International and will report to company president and chief executive Dave Calhoun. He will move to London to take up his new role.

“Brendan brings to his new position vast experience in government and diplomacy industry and non-profit associations that will serve us well as we continue to grow as a global company while navigating the dynamics of the geopolitical environment” said Calhoun.

Calhoun also thanked Arthur for his “tremendous contributions” to Boeing’s business.

In his new role Nelson will oversee 20 offices globally. The role entails growing the company outside the USA forming new partnerships overseeing international affairs and other areas.

Before joining Boeing in 2020 Nelson had held several Australian government roles including Minister of Defence and as director of the Australian War Memorial.

Maria Fernandez will succeed Nelson as president of Boeing Australia New Zealand and South Pacific from 20 December.

“Maria has had a distinguished career with more than 20 years of leadership experience in the Australian national security sector and was the first woman to lead an Australian intelligence agency” says Nelson.

“She has the ideal background for this position” says Nelson.

Fernandez has held senior roles in Australia’s several government departments including defence and home affairs.

Economy: Nicky Kelvin

Cost: 282 British pounds ($344).

I loved how comfortable the economy seat was. It had a solid recline and came with a complimentary pillow and blanket making the setup even more comfortable. It was a bonus to have a full entertainment system on a relatively short flight — some competitors on this route do not offer that. The inflight meal was delicious and plentiful especially the fish main course.

My main complaint is that the fuselage was very close to the side of the seat and encroached on my space making my spot a little uncomfortable. The boarding process was chaotic too: We had to wait in line to enter the gate area and again to board the aircraft.

Business Class: Liam Spencer

Cost: 42500 American Airlines AAdvantage miles plus 253 pounds ($308).

I thought the seat itself was extremely comfortable even though it did not have as much personal space as other business-class products. The fabric was soft and it felt as if you were sinking into the seat. There was an extensive cocktail menu and I opted for the tequila-based paloma. It was delicious and ranks as one of the best drinks I've ever had on a plane. Additionally the cabin crew was friendly going above and beyond to ensure I had everything I wanted.

The experience wasn't all perfect though. From starter to dessert the food service lasted more than two hours. This was largely due to a long wait time in between courses. I also thought that my footwell was fairly narrow making it hard to get into a comfy position once the seat had been turned into a fully flat bed. While I was lucky to not have a seat neighbor if I had been on a busier flight there would have been a significant lack of privacy.

There were various problems with them. My AC power didn’t work for my laptop but did work occasionally for my phone. My travelling companions had problems with headphones and when they tried to use their own – Bose and Sony – found the sound was much better but came out of only one ear – so perhaps a special adaptor is necessary. Across the aisle I could see a flight attendant repairing another seat with masking tape.

Best seats

Centre seats are best for couples window seats for single travellers. If in a window seat avoid row 11 which has no windows.

The flight was fairly uneventful and the flight attendants worked hard to make up for what had been through no fault of their own a fairly shambolic first impression with the boarding and the early part of the flight. This effort started with the meal service – details of the food follow but skip this if you aren’t interested.

And that may signal trouble for some local commercial real estate.

Bustling activity at the standalone restaurant is a surprise to some property executives because the building was supposed to be demolished by now to make way for a 27-story tower that would serve as the new corporate home of CBRE Group the world's largest commercial real estate brokerage by revenue. Multiple real estate sources have told CoStar News the proposed project at 2401 McKinney Ave. appears stalled amid rising interest rates and inflation.

The lack of progress is a rare hiccup for a metropolitan area that has been the national leader in luring companies that promise to invest millions of dollars and create thousands of jobs. Goldman Sachs for example is expected to employ at least 5000 workers at its new $500 million office campus in Uptown Dallas that is scheduled to break ground early next year.

""Right now to get something completed from start to finish you need a proven development team with a sophisticated lender with more equity than usual and it has to be a strong deal"" said Jack Matthews a developer experienced in working with the city of Dallas on projects and familiar with area development but not affiliated with the CBRE project. ""In the past other deals were getting done but I think it's going to be two to five years before we get back to those deals. There's a lot of uncertainty in the market right now.""

Construction was supposed to begin on CBRE's proposed 750000-square-foot office tower this past February according to a state permit. Not only has construction not begun but Truluck's is still taking reservations well into next year. At this rate the project might not meet the construction timeline spelled out in an incentive agreement between CBRE and the city of Dallas and that could imperil the brokerage's access to some public funds real estate professionals say.

The brokerage signed a formal agreement with the city of Dallas one year ago for the proposed tower helping the brokerage secure about $4 million in state and local economic incentives in exchange for meeting certain guidelines. Some of those guidelines include CBRE leasing at least 200000 square feet for its global headquarters at the new office tower that would be developed by Dallas-based Trammell Crow Co. CBRE's U.S. development arm.

The agreement specifies that the new tower must be constructed by the end of 2024 with CBRE taking occupancy no later than the end of 2025. With a little more than two years to complete a project that general contractors say would take 2 1/2 maybe even three years to develop real estate professionals say it seems unlikely CBRE will meet the construction milestones laid out in the incentive package.

CBRE declined to comment to CoStar News on the status of the project. A Trammell Crow spokeswoman also declined to comment. The city of Dallas has not received an update from CBRE on the project since the formal agreement was signed Dec. 1 2021 a city official told CoStar News.

Even so the deadline is still years away and there's no certainty that the firm won't either complete the project on time seek to negotiate changes to push back deadlines to qualify for the incentives or forgo the incentives if it should miss the deadline for construction.

Economic Shifts

A lot has changed in the past year since Dallas-based CBRE signed the agreement with construction costs escalating and upending capital markets leading the brokerage to take significant cost-cutting measures including laying off an unknown number of employees. The firm plans to cut $400 million of spending much of that tied to trimming its workforce by mid-2023.

CBRE's proposed new tower had an initial $200 million estimated cost at least at the time a state permit was filed in July 2021. Trammell Crow first started collecting construction bids for the project in August 2020 according to construction documents obtained by CoStar News at the time.

Trammell Crow told a neighborhood watchdog group in September 2020 it had the tower's financing in place. But fast forward more than two years later and those construction bids and financing are probably inadequate with what is required to develop the same skyscraper today because of increased construction materials and labor costs industry professionals say.

If the project is on hold it may be difficult for CBRE to move forward with its agreed-upon incentives with the city of Dallas said Larry Hamilton chairman and CEO of Hamilton Properties Corp. Hamilton who has worked through incentive agreements with the city on various projects but is not affiliated with the CBRE project said ""the city will require them to get an extension and go through a bunch of hoops. It won't be the simplest thing in the world to get the extension.""

The city of Dallas approved a $250000 economic incentive in exchange for CBRE building and leasing space at the new tower creating hundreds of jobs and forming internship programs with local colleges and universities. In addition CBRE was eligible to receive $3.45 million from the Texas Enterprise Fund to invest more than $29 million in its Dallas headquarters and create 460 new jobs. The deal which also included additional funds for CBRE to expand its operations center in Richardson Texas marked the first time the state's deal-closing fund offered economic incentives to a real estate brokerage.

The agreement with the state did not specify the address of where CBRE planned to invest in its Dallas headquarters. CBRE's headquarters has been at 2100 McKinney Ave. in Uptown Dallas since 2020 when it relocated its main corporate home from Los Angeles. The proposed development site of CBRE's new headquarters is located one block north of the brokerage's existing headquarters.

Uptown Dallas is one of the city's most sought-after neighborhoods for office space in proximity to luxury property such as The Ritz-Carlton hotel and residences and the occasional streetcar tooting its presence to pedestrians. CBRE rivals including JLL Cushman & Wakefield Newmark and Avison Young have offices in the walkable upscale neighborhood. McKinney Avenue is known for having the city's priciest office rents per square foot. Uptown has a vacancy rate of 15.6% slightly lower than the city's average of 17.4% according to CoStar data.

But Uptown faces headwinds as office tenants reevaluate leases because of work-from-home trends having an uncertain effect on future office demand. The uncertainty of the future of office space has likely played a role in slowing progress on CBRE's proposed new tower industry professionals say.

Lending Tightens

CBRE is expected to lease about 25% of the office space at the proposed new tower leaving about a half-million square feet without a tenant and on the balance sheet at a time when the company is scaling back. Lending has tightened since early September causing CBRE's sales and loan originations to fall sharply in the third quarter and cloud the brokerage's earnings. CBRE is planning to cut $300 million in costs related to reducing its headcount the company said in its third-quarter earnings report.

Other major new office projects are underway in Uptown including two being developed by Dallas-area developers. Granite Properties broke ground on 23Springs in June and Dallas-based Harwood International broke ground on Harwood No. 14 in 2021.

King White president and CEO of Dallas-based Site Selection Group said the uncertain economic climate hitting companies throughout the United States would probably give CBRE some traction in renegotiating its performance-driven economic incentive agreement with the city and state.

The agreement between the city of Dallas and CBRE has a force majeure clause an “act of God” provision that became a bigger part of real estate negotiations during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic a so-called act of God was typically tied to a war natural disaster or other uncontrollable circumstances to free landlords or tenants from being held liable to lease terms. It is not clear if the force majeure clause in CBRE's agreement in which the city is allowed to extend deadlines in certain circumstances could come into play possibly as a negotiating tactic with the brokerage's new headquarters.

White who isn't involved in CBRE's economic incentives said the firm wouldn't be the only company seeking to renegotiate its economic incentive agreement with shifts to remote work causing some issues with compliance with full-time employees often tied to working in a specific place or city in order to receive incentives.

For example the city of Plano a suburb north of Dallas redid its incentive agreement last year to accommodate for JPMorgan's remote work policy. JPMorgan received nearly $5 million in incentives from the city of Plano where it has a 1.5 million-plus-square-foot campus and 4500 employees in an agreement stemming from 2016.

In addition the rise in construction costs and tight labor conditions have also upended compliance of incentives agreed to years ago King said.

""The office sector is not very stable right now with financing being difficult to secure"" King added. ""We are expecting interest rates to remain high and continue to escalate for another year at least.""

Meanwhile the food keeps coming at Truluck's in the 14063-square-foot site on McKinney Avenue where it has operated since 2015. Truluck's was expected to anchor the ground-floor retail portion of CBRE's new office tower once built. An executive for the corporate chain declined to comment on the proposed new tower or if the restaurant has plans to move to an interim location during construction.

""We have no comment at this time out of respect for"" the 75 employees who work at the McKinney Avenue location said Riley Hutton director of hospitality and managing partner of Truluck's. ""We still have a very successful operation that we need to protect and this location has no shutdown date.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjIvMTIvMDQvY2FuLXByaXZhdGUtY2x1YnMtYnJpbmctbmV3LXlvcmstd29ya2Vycy1iYWNrLXRvLXRoZS1vZmZpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Workers Enticed Back to New York Offices with Private Clubs,"The return to office has been slow and uneven but some New York developers of high-end buildings are hoping elite private clubs can lure workers back Forbes reports.

”The future of workspace design is about creating a destination” Tom Vecchione principal at the architecture and interior design firm Vocon said to Forbes. “We can see the line between traditional workplaces and classic residential development blurring. The design for work needs to include wellness and that hospitality or a home-away-from-home feel.”

To that end some landlords are thinking outside the cube. One Willoughby Square in Brooklyn includes amenities such as a coffee lounge outdoor balcony banquette seating covered outdoor space and a custom bar.

Meanwhile the Lever House in midtown Manhattan boasts the Lever Club an exclusive 15000-square-foot private club that has a members-only lounge restaurant and conference space. Lever designed by architecture firm Marmol Radziner is a selling point to companies and their high-level executives Callie Haines executive vice president and head of New York for the office business of Brookfield Properties told the outlet.

The landmarked 550 Madison has a full-floor private club — with a billiards room and dining table along with a library — for office tenants and their employees the outlet reported. The space once housed AT&T’s headquarters.

New York has no shortage of private clubs including one that will essentially serve as a co-working space for the wealthy. In August Edmond Safra and restaurateur Juan Santa Cruz announced they are taking the 37th floor of Boston Properties’ GM Building for its private club Colette.

Shares in the club will cost $125000 — though members can resell their shares — with annual dues of $36000 with membership capped at 300.

In November a portion of the Jane Hotel at 113 Jane Street in the West Village was converted into a private club.

The ballroom was turned into a members-only restaurant under the SVB banner while the rooftop bar became an outdoor lounge.

The 40000-square-foot home has been under construction for five years and is 90 percent complete the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Real estate professionals say the $24.95 million asking price is believed to be the highest-ever for a residential property in the southern half of the Garden State.

Carlton and Orsula Knowlton formerly of Tabula Rasa HealthCare Inc. are the sellers.

Kevin Steiger with Kurfiss Sotheby’s International Realty is the listing agent for the seven-bedroom home at 2801 Riverton Road in the town located across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.

The home sits on more than 7 acres and has 10 bathrooms a courtyard with a reflecting pool a sports-themed bar six fireplaces and an indoor swimming pool. There’s also a movie theater wine cellar vehicle elevator and chapel in the home.

The primary suite has a sitting area dual walk-in closets and a spa bathroom that’s equipped with a tube elevator that goes down to the indoor pool and fitness area.

The home drew the criticism of local residents when a 200-year-old farmhouse was torn down to make way for the massive mansion.

Steiger said “there will definitely not be open houses” and that interested buyers will have to show proof of ability to purchase before seeing it in person. “The number of people who could afford a property like this are the 1 percent of the 1 percent.”

A home in North Jersey recently sold for a city record. At the end of November the home at 55 Mercer Street in Jersey City sold for $4.4 million the highest price for a single-family home in the city. The previous record holder was 124 Sussex Street which sold for $4.15 million.

Her coworker has confessed to the killing,"Starr Brown a Black transgender woman was shot and killed in Tennessee last month and a coworker has reportedly confessed to the crime.

Police in Memphis say Brown was murdered in the early morning hours of April 19 after she finished her work shift at Checkers a drive-thru fast-food establishment according to local CBS affiliate WREG. She was seen on video driving away in her Pontiac G3 with coworker Alexander Williamson 20 just after 2:30 a.m. Brown’s body was discovered in her car several hours later in a wooded area on Rolling Woods Drive. She suffered a single gunshot wound to her left side.

On April 28 Williamson voluntarily walked into a police station and confessed to the crime local Fox affiliate WHBQ-TV reported. He reportedly gave a full confession but police provided no information about a possible motive or why he decided to confess.

Alexander Williamson Shelby County Sheriff's Office

Brown is the 11th known trans individual to die violently this year and the second known Black trans woman to be killed according to the Human Rights Campaign.

Jasmine Tasaki founder of WeCare Tennesse which supports trans women of color in the state decried violence against Black trans women and called for greater efforts on behalf of the trans community.

“It saddens me that we are living in a time where black transwomen are murdered with no outrage” Tasaki said in a statement. “Our community continues to suffer yet we find ways to go on. It is with deep hurt that I say Starr Brown’s name. She is now with the ancestors and can rest. It’s our duty to push harder for liberation for our people; we can only save ourselves.”

Brown was a victim of violence last year when shot while waiting for an Uber after work on October 18. She was accosted by two men around 3 a.m. She was able to use mace on the man with a gun but he wiped his face and shot her in the leg. She later told local ABC affiliate WATN-TV she felt lucky that the man didn’t shoot her in the back as she fled.

This is not the first time Williamson has been charged with murder. He was arrested in 2022 along with his brothers Artavious 23 and Ajaylin. 22 for the shooting death of a man who had been in an earlier dispute with Artvavious. He reportedly returned with his brothers to the man’s Memphis home where he shot and killed him after challenging him to a fist fight WHBQ-TV reported at the time. Williamson then 19 was charged with second-degree murder."

This spring there was more work than many companies could handle but a shortage of labor and materials. Within months interest rates doubled and home building plunged.

Ryan is president and owner of Genz-Ryan a market-leading HVAC company founded more than 70 years ago by his father. For years the company's bread and butter was installing furnaces and air conditioners in new houses.

Not anymore. He recently shuttered the new-construction division of Genz-Ryan wiping out the work of 40 people. The company will focus on service and installations.

""It's been like trying to turn the Titanic"" he said referring to the well-known ship that sank after hitting an iceberg. ""Only about one-third of what you can see is above water. It's what you can't see that worries me.""

After a pandemic-fueled building boom that left builders and their subcontractors overwhelmed and exhausted a sudden contraction is reshaping the industry.

""We are seeing prudence exercised by many segments of the homebuilding industry in response to the slowing pace over the past several months"" said James Vagle CEO of Housing First Minnesota.

The situation is especially perplexing for companies that were in business during the 2008 housing crash which sent skilled workers fleeing to other industries. While they're well aware that the region is still in need of tens of thousands of new houses and apartments they also realize that demand can quickly ebb and flow.

""Builders and trade partners are being cautious as many have gone through cycle slowdowns in construction before"" Vagle said. ""The challenge is that the demand for homes did not vanish it's just sitting on the sidelines. Builders know eventually they are going to have to ramp back up again in order to supply our region with much needed housing.""

To be sure no one anticipates the kind of housing crash that triggered the Great Recession in 2008. That downturn was caused by risk lending and an oversupply of new houses which is not the case today.

That recession happened when Ryan wasn't yet in charge and about 90% of the company's customers were home builders. Though they lost about two-thirds of their business the company was less diversified than it was today so exiting the new-build business wasn't an option.

""Our business mix wouldn't have allowed us to make that decision"" Ryan said. He added ""And I was a lot younger and had the energy to be able to handle a downturn.""

Today Ryan says that because so many people are spending so much more time in their homes including remote work they're using their furnace and air conditioning a lot more. That equipment and their components need more service and replacement.

And he said because people are staying put longer focusing on servicing existing clients makes a lot more sense than it did during the last recession.

Because fewer people are moving there have been few sellers and even fewer buyers but prices keep rising. Last week the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index showed that home prices in the Twin Cities during September were more than 6% higher than last year at the same time. That gain was smaller than earlier this year but in line with historical averages.

For builders it was a record-breaking spring and many are still building houses that were purchased earlier this year. More recently building permits have tumbled. During November builders pulled half as many permits as they did the year before according to new data released last week by Housing First Minnesota.

That shift has left many builders subcontractors and their suppliers only cautiously optimistic about 2023.

It's a paradox that has the nation's largest builders and suppliers looking for ways to control costs. Executives at Builders FirstSource the Dallas-based leading supplier of building products recently told investors they're executing what they call a ""downturn playbook"" which includes freezing or reducing jobs.

Several publicly traded home builders including Pulte Homes which has a major presence in the Twin Cities are canceling options on land purchases and scaling back development plans.

Michael Ramme vice president of land acquisition for Centra a Coon Rapids-based developer said that as national builders ""pump the brakes"" there are opportunities for companies that aren't beholden to shareholders to acquire land more affordably than last summer. He said it's getting easier to hire subcontractors.

""There are subs who now need the work; two years ago they wouldn't even look at you"" Ramme said. ""The tables have turned.""

At Genz-Ryan that change in fortune forced a reckoning. Ryan said he reached the decision to close the construction division even though it was getting easier to hire workers and obtain supplies.

The final straw Ryan said was the realization that so many homeowners are locked into the lowest mortgage rates in a generation. That means they're unlikely to move because if they buy again they would contend with sharply higher rates. Those frozen homeowners could be a drag on homebuilding for the next several years.

""It was really about rising interest rates; that changed everything"" Ryan said. ""But I felt like this was the right time for us to make the decision.""

Some of those 40 employees that lost their jobs stayed with the company and were reassigned in its service division Ryan said. Others were able to quickly find other jobs.

As much as Ryan was concerned about his ability to keep crews busy during the housing downturn he saw the decision as an opportunity to aggressively grow the service and replacement business.

He wants the company known for its advertising with the catchphrase ""I love those guys"" to remain a local standout at a time when private-equity firms are buying heating and cooling firms and consolidating them under national brands.

Ryan said that he's in the process of turning the former new-construction showroom and selection center into the Jack Ryan Academy which is named after his father. He'll use that space to train workers.

Making the decision to eliminate the new-construction division of his company was like a ""gut punch"" he said. But he added it's the right decision given the ongoing challenges facing the industry.

""The study of economics is the science of trying to satisfy unlimited wants with limited resources"" Ryan said. ""This really came down to a handful of decisions.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jay-Z joins Times Square team bidding for prized NYC casino,"SL Green and Caesars Entertainment have a glam new partner in their hoped-for Times Square casino — Brooklyn-born billionaire rapper and entertainment impresario Jay-Z and his Roc Nation Realty Check has learned.

The three-way partnership to be announced at SL Green’s annual investor conference on Monday marks a dramatic twist in the developer’s and Caesars’ quest to launch a casino at SL Green’s 1515 Broadway office tower. (They’re among a half-dozen teams that are also expected to submit proposals to the state for a first full-scale casino in the Big Apple.)

Although details have yet to be spelled out Jay-Z and his team are expected to oversee entertainment programming at 1515 Broadway and at other SL Green properties at the “Crossroads of the World.” The city’s largest commercial landlord SLG has interests in six Times Square properties with a total of more than four million square feet.

In a statement Jay-Z said “New York is the epicenter of culture. We have the opportunity to create a destination at the heart of the true crossroads of the word. My partnership with SL Green and Caesars has all the promise and commitment to economic opportunity growth and enrichment for the community and everyone that visits the Empire State.”

SLG chief executive officer Marc Holliday also shared more specifics about his company’s casino proposal than have ever been disclosed.

Contrary to claims that Caesars Palace Times Square as it’s to be called would be a mammoth gaming mecca that might overwhelm everything around it the casino would occupy only eight floors in the 54-story tower between West 43d and 44th streets.

None would be the ground floor which is earmarked for non-gaming uses including an entrance to the Minskoff Theater home of “The Lion King.”

“We are putting theater at ground level” Holliday emphasized.

The casino floors would also house restaurants and entertainment uses. Holliday estimated that the “boutique”-size casino might occupy as little as 250000 square feet of floor space a postage stamp compared with typical sprawling gaming floors in Atlantic City or Las Vegas.

A new approximately 800-room five-star hotel would be created in the building above them. Holliday said he was “not yet prepared” to address how the tower’s office tenants including Paramount Global’s headquarters would be affected.

He rebutted claims by the Broadway League which represents theater owners and producers that a casino would be “dangerous” to Broadway theaters. On the contrary he said SL Green’s proposal is designed to bolster all the businesses around it. Although the League is adamantly opposed to having a casino in its midst the plan is enthusiastically backed by owners of restaurants such as Carmine’s Bond 45 and Junior’s and by Actors Equity and hotel and construction unions.

According to Holliday consulting firm AKRF projects that casino visitors will buy 400000 net new Broadway tickets annually. Additionally SLG/Caesars/Roc Nation will purchase thousands of tickets directly that will be provided both to casino patrons and to underserved communities.

The casino company’s loyalty program known as Caesars Rewards which boasts 60 million members worldwide provides so-called bankable rewards that can be used at hotels restaurants theaters and stores beyond 1515 Broadway.

As part of a “halo effect” Holliday expects the casino will generate seven million more annual visitors to Times Square generate seven million restaurant meals outside the casino and $166 million in retail purchases outside the casino building.

In SL Green’s view the 1515 Broadway project is needed to help arrest a slow gradual decline in the district’s fortunes.

The slide Holliday said doesn’t yet mark a return to the lawless days of the 1970s-early 1990s — although crime is noticeably up — but rather a slow-but-steady unraveling of the commercial energy and sense of security that Times Square had only 10 years ago.

Some major companies such as Skadden and EY have moved away. Times Square-district office vacancy has soared from 5% in 2012 to nearly 25% today according to CBRE.

Since Toys ‘R’ Us left in 2015 more national retailers — possibly including Forever 21 and American Eagle Outfitters — are also looking to exit citing a decline in the quality of the street environment. Meanwhile more taco doughnut and other types of fast-food joints are moving in.

The state will issue a formal request for proposal (RFP) for casino applicants next month. The selection panel will then move some responses to a state siting committee which is expected to choose one location in the five boroughs before the end of the year.

In addition to SLG/Caesars/Roc Nation wannabe operators are expected to include Related Companies and Wynn Resorts at Hudson Yards Mets owner Steve Cohen and a casino partner near Citi Field in Queens and Soloviev Building Company and a casino partner for a complex called Freedom Plaza on First Avenue in the East 30s.

***

At least one company is moving to Times Square: accounting advisory firm Anchin Block & Anchin signed a lease for 45673 at Rudin’s Three Times Square which is undergoing a major $25 million upgrade program.

Anchin will move from 1375 Broadway in fall of 2023.

Landlord executive vice-president Michael Rudin said that Anchin was “exactly the sort of firm we had in mind” when his company set out to reposition the tower where Touro College and University System signed for 243000 square feet earlier this year. About 450000 square feet remain available.

Anchin was repped by teams from Colliers and Cushman & Wakefield. Rudin was repped in-house.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYS1UcmF2ZWwvTGFzLVZlZ2FzLUdyYW5kLVByaXgtaG90ZWwtcGFja2FnZXMtb24tc2FsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hotels are already gearing up for Las Vegas Grand Prix in November,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/North-America-Travel/Las-Vegas-Grand-Prix-hotel-packages-on-sale on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYS1UcmF2ZWwvTGFzLVZlZ2FzLUdyYW5kLVByaXgtaG90ZWwtcGFja2FnZXMtb24tc2FsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zdHJpcC1hZGRzLWEtdW5pcXVlLXRlc2xhLWV4cGVyaWVuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Las Vegas Strip Adds a Unique Tesla Experience,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thestreet.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /travel/las-vegas-strip-adds-a-unique-tesla-experience (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C4905ABA00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zdHJpcC1hZGRzLWEtdW5pcXVlLXRlc2xhLWV4cGVyaWVuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L25ldy15ZWFycy1ldmUtaW4tdmVnYXMvbmV3LXllYXJzLWV2ZS1pbi1sYXMtdmVnYXMtYS1ndWlkZS10by1maXJld29ya3MtY29uY2VydHMtYW5kLXBhcnRpZXMtMjY4NzM3MC_SAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9uZXcteWVhcnMtZXZlLWluLXZlZ2FzL25ldy15ZWFycy1ldmUtaW4tbGFzLXZlZ2FzLWEtZ3VpZGUtdG8tZmlyZXdvcmtzLWNvbmNlcnRzLWFuZC1wYXJ0aWVzLTI2ODczNzAvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Year’s Eve in Las Vegas: A guide to fireworks concerts and parties,"From The Killers to Gwen Stefani Fremont Street Experience to Area15 there are plenty of parties and performers to end 2022.

Las Vegas The Entertainment Capital of the World is now more than ever deserving of a new moniker — World Culinary Destination.

While many visitors still come for the shows concerts and sporting events foodies are flocking to the city to indulge in fine food. In the past decade the simple steakhouse and late-night buffet has given way to a wide variety of cuisines thanks to a large influx of Michelin-starred chefs and top restaurateurs.

While it’s impossible to experience all Las Vegas has to offer on the culinary scene it’s definitely fun trying.

On a recent four-day whirlwind food and cocktail tour I happily noshed my way through several new celebrity restaurants like The Bedford by Martha Stewart at Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino Ramsay’s Kitchen the sixth Las Vegas restaurant by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay which opened Nov. 12 at Harrah’s Las Vegas and RPM Italian at The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace partly owned by celebrity couple Giuliana and Bill Rancic the latter the winner of the first season of NBC’s The Apprentice.

“We are really proud of all the RPMs but this one in particular is exceeding our expectations and people are really loving it here in Vegas” says Rancic of their 8th RPM which opened last May (the others are in Chicago and Washington D.C.)

“People think about Vegas for gambling and casinos but it’s a great restaurant and hospitality town. There is such a wonderful food scene here with wonderful hospitality professionals” adds one of the other co-owners Jerrod Melman of Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants which operate five other restaurants in Las Vegas.

When it comes to cocktails Las Vegas has a beverage selection like none other with drinks served in the most amazing fashion (smoky glass presentations are big here) and in the most stylish over-the-top environments.

Again celebrities factor large when it comes to cocktail lounges whether they own them like Lisa Vanderpump best known for appearing in American reality television shows or by the list of celebrities who frequent them.

Vanderpump recently opened Vanderpump Paris an eclectic Parisian-inspired affair located in the Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. Here you can order pretty pink drinks with pink cotton candy on top or have them served on a golden tray inside a crown in a restaurant/lounge worthy of Marie Antoinette.

Meanwhile for a very masculine atmosphere there’s Barbershop Cuts and Cocktails at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas which is a speakeasy where you gain access by cutting through an actual barbershop.

Lead mixologist Tony Arnone tells me if you visit later in the evening you never know who will drop in to play an unannounced set. Machine Gun Kelly Bruno Mars Robin Thicke John Legend Macy Gray and the Zac Brown Band have all played here he says.

Even if you aren’t a hard-core foodie you have to eat — so why not treat yourself to a top dining experience in this culinary wonderland. Here are just a few of my favourites places to indulge.

The Mayfair Supper Club

For an old-time Las Vegas vibe that serves up not only outstanding dishes but great entertainment I visited The Mayfair Supper Club at the Bellagio Resort & Casino which opened on New Year’s Eve in 2020. Plush booths and linen-topped tables look out to the Fountains of the Bellagio providing additional entertainment throughout the night. But as each delectable dish arrived it was nearly impossible to catch all of the show. While my caviar-topped whole Dover sole was delicious I was equally amazed by the deserts. The cherries jubilee set on fire directly behind my seat was a show in and of itself but the chocolate and hazelnut cigar balancing on top of edible chocolate ash was my favourite. A smoker could have easily mistaken it for the real thing.

Wakuda

Two Michelin-starred chef Tetsuya Wakuda has joined the long list of other top chefs to set up shop in Las Vegas. The Japan-born chef who has received high accolades for his other restaurants in Singapore and Sydney has created a culinary adventure for diners at Wakuda’s first U.S. restaurant. Wakuda combines the freshest of produce with French culinary arts and Japanese presentation. The fresh sushi and sashimi was so outstanding that a fellow diner at my table who normally refuses to eat raw fish was converted. Personally I’m not a fan of wasabi but I also changed my tune after eating the fresh wasabi Wakuda brings in from Tasmania. The restaurant located at The Venetian Resort initially feels like you are visiting Tokyo as you walk past neon street lights in the entry but after turning the corner you are in a softly-lit Japanese sanctuary where two white sumo sculptures square off between pink cherry blossom trees.

The Bedford

If you are a fan of Martha Stewart The Bedford styled after Stewart’s New York farmhouse is an opportunity to taste her signature dishes. It’s impossible to resist Stewart’s amazing bread basket with fresh Parker House rolls and rosemary and cherries focaccia. Be careful not to eat it all to save room for Stewart’s potato-filled perogis finished in brown butter her perfectly plated (and yummy) oysters Rockerfeller and her crab cakes. For entrees my fellow diners quickly polished off the whole roast chicken and baked potatoes topped with creme fraiche and bacon. Since I’m a pescatarian I opted for a seafood bouillabaisse with generous portions of lobster halibut snapper and mussels.

Sadelle’s

There’s a reason why there’s always a lineup for weekend brunch at Sadelle’s Cafe at Bellagio Resort & Casino. The food is simply excellent from the bruleed grapefruit to the caviar topped eggs Benedict (if you really want to treat yourself) but don’t forget about their tried and true New-York-style bagels and lox or the avocado toast.

Catch

Surprisingly there wasn’t as long a line up at Catch at Aria Resort & Casino for brunch but the food was just as good as Sadelle’s within an equally instagramable setting. The truffle sashimi is a must as well as the decadent Anytime Waffle Tower layered with maple milk chocolate and raspberry ice cream.

The RPM Italian

Authentic Italian cuisine is served up in this contemporary restaurant where 10 to 12 fresh pastas are made daily. It’s no surprise that one of the best pasta dishes on the menu Mama DePandi’s Pomodoro was a dish created by the Italian mother of part-owner Giuliana Rancic. Other standouts include the Maine Lobster Caprese the truffled garlic bread and spicy King Crab pasta.

But as our pro tasters will tell you it’s not entirely about eating after all.

Take Lisa Schroeder former associate sensory scientist — i.e. professional taster — for Mars Wrigley Confectionery U.S. In between bites of M&M’s Snickers Dove and Skittles Schroeder took time to create computer programs to evaluate products planned trainings ahead of product launches ran team taste-testing panel sessions and continued her own tasting education.

When she wasn't slurping soup Jane Freiman former director of the Campbell’s Soup Co. consumer test kitchen was evaluating new recipes giving feedback to chefs and running taste panels.

Elizabeth McCall distiller and master taster for Woodford Reserve doesn’t sip bourbon all day long. McCall also spends time speaking at various events hosting personal tastings for clients and auditing the brand’s procedures and production facility to find ways to improve both.

If you’re still on board to become a taster these three women can tell you how to do it.

Have a superior sense of taste

Newsflash: You can’t become a taster without a strong sense of taste — one that allows you to focus on multiple layers of flavors and differentiate them. In fact when you apply for a job as a professional taster your tongue — for all intents and purposes — is the real interviewee says Schroeder. “You [will] go through multiple screenings that focus on your experience with food and how you taste things” Schroeder describes. “And there are also screenings that test your ability to identify [the] basic tastes.”

Learn to speak taste

A superior sense of taste won’t get you very far as a professional taster if you can’t characterize what you’re experiencing. “Learning how to describe foods and their attributes is a key part of the role” Freiman says. “For example I cannot just say a product tastes ‘good.’ But I can describe a lemon with ‘it’s sweet but tart with a harsh bite.’”

Take palate training

Whether you’re tasting candies soups or fine wines you’ll need to complete “in-depth palate training” says McCall which — in addition to learning to identify specific tastes — will include learning the different kinds of mouthfeels. For example here’s what McCall’s palate training looked like: “We had aroma jars with different attributes and worked on creating the sensory memory of the different flavors” she recalls. Schroeder says she underwent six months of training. “I was trained to identify and refer back to specific tastes textures and other aspects of the ingredients we use” she describes. “The training is more intense than people think so some people do drop out of the training process. But everyone who makes it through the training gets to become a taste tester.”

Skip culinary school — if you want

In case you were curious “contrary to what many people might think you do not need to go to culinary school to become a professional taste tester” says Freiman. “I didn’t.” Of course Freiman admits she works with people who did graduate from culinary school. “But” she says “I find it more important that a candidate is hard working curious and has a passion for food. This career takes years of dedication and training and having such a love for this [career and for food] really makes the difference.”

Understand the ever-changing consumer

As a professional taster you know what you like but it’s also important to stay in touch with what consumers are demanding. “In this role you must regularly talk to consumers about their taste preferences learn how they cook and what new foods they are interested in” says Freiman. With this information you will be better able to recommend changes to recipes based on both taste and consumer demand.

Never stop learning and developing your palate

According to McCall “there is always an opportunity to improve” as a professional taster. So she advises “really pay attention while you are eating and drinking. Think about the flavors and always work on describing what you are eating — in and out of work — even if you are just describing it to yourself” she says. “Attend trainings when you can even on products outside of your area of expertise.” Schroeder agrees. “Overall my number one piece of advice for an aspiring taste tester is to expand your food horizons and to try all kinds of foods” she says. What a tough job folks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvcmVkcGFuZGEuY29tL3NocnVuay1wcm9kdWN0LXNpemVzLXNocmlua2ZsYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,50 Of The Worst Examples Of “Shrinkflation” Shared In This Online Group (New Pics),"If you’d love to see more products that were “shrunken” in size make sure to check out our previous post on Bored Panda by clicking here .

A popular subreddit called “ Shrinkflation ” has consumers posting and discussing all the ways the manufacturers are trying to trick our eyes into thinking that the product is still the same whether it may be the size formula or even subtle changes in the packaging quality.

Have you ever stopped and noticed the product you bought a while ago being smaller now than it was before? Well perhaps you weren’t dreaming when you thought that. With recent inflation that has touched most countries all around the world companies now more than ever are trying to hike up the prices for their products and some of them are smaller than before be it a roll of toilet paper or even a pack of gummy bears.

Shrinkflation is a strategy often used by businesses to subtly lower a product's size or weight in order to make savings without raising the overall price. There’s also an uncommon kind of shrinkflation when a business substitutes less expensive ingredients or increases the amount of water while reducing the amount of other ingredients in their products.

Still in some countries like Brazil companies cannot get away with reducing the product’s size or quantity without them having to state that on their labels for the next 6 months. While some countries have laws to protect their consumer rights to a great extent do you think other countries should be following that example in times like these as well?

The No. 7 Clemson Tigers champions of the Atlantic Coast Conference will take on the No. 6 Tennessee Volunteers from the Southeastern Conference on Friday December 30 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

It will be the first ever meeting between the teams in the Orange Bowl game. The teams have met 19 times before with the Volunteers holding a 11-6-2 lead but Clemson having the most recent win in the series with a 27-14 victory in the Peach Bowl to end the 2003 season.

The Tigers (11-2) won the ACC’s Atlantic Division for the sixth time in the last eight seasons and defeated North Carolina on Saturday for their seventh conference title over that eight-season span.

Clemson has appeared in the Orange Bowl six times before and has a combined 4-2 record. The Tigers last appeared in the game in the 2015 season when they defeated Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff semifinal.

Tennessee (10-2) finished second in the SEC’s East Division in a season that was highlighted by their second win over rival Florida in the last 18 seasons and their first win over Alabama since the 2006 season.

The Vols will be making their fifth Orange Bowl appearance with a previous record of 1-3 and its last time in the bowl game being in the 1997 season.

This year’s game will be the eighth time the ACC champion has played in the Orange Bowl since the game signed a deal with the conference in the 2006 season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdXBncmFkZWRwb2ludHMuY29tL25ld3MvY2Fwb25lLXZlbnR1cmUteC1jYXJkLXByaW9yaXR5LXBhc3MtdXBkYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capital One Venture X Removing Non-lounge Priority Pass Benefits,"If you’re a cardholder of the Capital One Venture X Credit Card there’s some bad news regarding your access to Priority Pass experiences. Effective January 1 2023 the Priority Pass memberships associated with the Capital One Venture X card will no longer include non-lounge experiences such as airport restaurants and spas.

What Are Priority Pass Non-lounge Experiences?

It’s worth noting what Priority Pass non-lounge experiences are so you know what you may be losing. Having a traditional Priority Pass membership gets you access to lounge spaces that typically include private areas usually with seating charging outlets and complimentary snacks and beverages as well as restrooms.

While most users think of the membership as being for lounges there are other ways to utilize the memberships. Beyond lounges a traditional Priority Pass membership also has access to discounts and credits at airport restaurants discounts at shopping retailers complimentary spa treatments and more.

For example many airports have select restaurants where your Priority Pass can receive a dining credit. You’re provided a credit of about $28 or so for yourself and an additional credit for 1 guest that you can take off of the total bill excluding gratuity. For most restaurants these credits will get you a meal for 2 people and you can leave full vs. accessing a lounge with only simple snacks on offer.

Removal of Non-Lounge Experiences

Per Capital One the non-lounge experiences will not be accessible to cardholders as of January 1 2023. This means that if you visit a restaurant included in the program you’ll be charged the full price of your meal and you won’t receive any credit or discount.

While not necessarily a game changer this is a benefit that has set the Capital One Venture X card apart from similar American Express cards which have had the non-lounge experiences removed for several years. Presumably it doesn’t make much sense to offer this benefit since Capital One likely has to pay more for these non-lounges to be included in the suite of benefits. With a relatively low annual fee for a premium credit card it’s no surprise that Capital One has decided to remove this perk.

Hot Tip: The Chase Sapphire Reserve® will still have non-lounge experience access with its Priority Pass membership.

Final Thoughts

It’s disappointing to see Capital One remove non-lounge experiences from Priority Pass memberships. Moving forward Chase will be the only card issuer that still includes these benefits so it may make sense for you to obtain an eligible Chase card to continue to receive credits at airport restaurants worldwide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2NhcGl0YWwtb25lLXZlbnR1cmUteC1wcmlvcml0eS1wYXNzLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capital One Venture X Eliminates Priority Pass Restaurant Benefit,"My dear readers some links on this site pay us referral fees for sending business and sales.

Sad news for Capital One Venture X cardholders including me: the Priority Pass restaurant benefit will be cut in early 2023. But I’m still keeping the card.

No More Priority Pass Restaurant Benefit For Capital One Venture X Cardholders

I greatly enjoy the Priority Pass restaurant benefit when traveling which provides $28/person in restaurant credit for you and a guest for select Priority Pass cardholders. These restaurants are generally less crowded than lounges and I have enjoyed some great meals over the years.

Not all Priority Pass memberships are created equal. Those issued in conjunction with an American Express Platinum card do not include the restaurant benefit. Those issued in conjunction with a Chase Sapphire Reserve card do include restaurant access. Up until now Capital One Venture X cardholders also enjoyed Priority Pass restaurant access but that is changing in 2023.

Effective January 1 2023 Priority Pass membership in conjunction with Capital One Venture X will no longer include non-lounge Priority Pass access (which includes restaurants and airport “experiences” like gaming or spas). This is bad news and there is no upside; Capital One is cutting this access because it can.

The good news is that with 10000-anniversary miles and a $300 annual travel credit the $395 annual fee still pays for itself. Furthermore Capital One Venture X cardholders will continue to enjoy access to Priority Pass and Plaza Premium lounges as well as Capital One lounges (though only one is currently open).

So yes I’ll keep the card. But this is sad news especially because I fly through San Francisco (SFO) so often which offers four Priority Pass restaurants in the terminals that I use most often.

CONCLUSION

The Capital One Venture X will no longer include Priority Pass restaurant access as of January 1 2023. I hate this news because I use it often but that probably explains why this benefit is being cut: because people actually use it…

Sadly it would not surprise me to see Chase follow though I hold out some hope that it will continue to allow its cardholders to access Priority Pass restaurants.

Will this change impact your use of the Capital One Venture X card?

However you would still enjoy checked bag benefits and early boarding benefits that come from having the Amex Delta Reserve card for example — even though you didn't pay for your flight with that card.

The only situation in which you must use your card is when you make an onboard purchase with Delta. To enjoy your 20% discount (in the form of a statement credit) make inflight food and beverage purchases with your eligible Delta card; if you pay with another card you won't receive this benefit. You may also be asked to show your Delta Reserve or Delta Reserve Business card when visiting lounges before your flight.

Outside of flights use your Delta card to enjoy perks like MQD boosts from making purchases on the Delta Reserve and Delta Platinum cards. But this may not impact which card you use to pay for your Delta flight assuming you're meeting those spending thresholds through other purchases.

Bottom line

Options abound; there are many different credit cards you could use when paying for a flight — whether that's buying a cash ticket at a great price or paying the taxes and fees when redeeming your miles. If you're making a reservation with Delta Air Lines there are many benefits you may be able to enjoy on your flight simply by having a Delta credit card in your wallet.

The good news is that you can enjoy many of these benefits regardless of which credit card you use to pay for your flight. This leaves you free to use whichever card you want to enjoy the insurance protections or bonus points offered on other cards in your wallet.

Introduced into standard therapy in 2000 they changed CML from a fatal disease to a chronic condition compatible with normal life.

Today several such oral drugs are available on the market. But they cost on average more than $200000 per year when under patent which can be for 12 to 20 years or longer depending on how the pharmaceutical company modifies the patent’s conditions. With many insurers charging patients out-of-pocket expenses of up to 25% such drugs — though readily available — can become unaffordable without an annual cap making patients “functionally uninsured.” It is estimated that up to 30% of patients with CML and other cancers are in this situation.

Advertisement

The first such drug for CML was imatinib (Gleevec). It lost its patent in 2017 and is now available as a generic drug with 15 formulations on the market in the U.S. The common wisdom is that once four to five generic versions of a drug become available its price falls drastically. Sadly this has not been the case for CML drugs nor for most cancer drugs in the existing health care system.

It is true that the average price of the 15 imatinib generics has fallen from more than $130000 per year to about $5000 per year (a price still much higher than the cost to manufacture the drug which is less than $400 per year). But that is the price drug companies charge. Once a drug is manufactured it starts a complex often inconsistent supply chain path allowing different intermediaries along the way to insert their own profit margins.

These include wholesalers pharmacies hospitals group purchasing organizations and pharmacy benefit managers. The price that wholesalers (including the top three U.S. drug distributors AmerisourceBergen McKesson and Cardinal Health) pay to acquire drugs from manufacturers is called a wholesale acquisition cost or WAC while the price that pharmacies or hospitals pay wholesalers is known as the average wholesale price or AWP. Pharmacies and hospitals are usually part of a group purchasing organization that negotiates to buy drugs at a lower cost called the GPO price. As the supply chain moves closer to the patient other intermediaries become involved including pharmacy benefit managers who control what medications are on insurance formularies. The pharmacy benefit managers negotiate drug prices directly with manufacturers and often maximize their leverage by securing deals with manufacturers for significant rebates. This increases both the profits of pharmacy benefit managers and the prices patients pay.

The end result is a price bubble that benefits many of the players but not the patient. In the instance of generic imatinib while the average price of the drug when it leaves the manufacturer is $5000 per year 12 of the 15 generics end up costing the patient an astounding $132000 per year.

Enter into this mix billionaire Mark Cuban who recently launched Cost Plus an online drug company that bypasses distributors and offers generic medications to patients (with a physician prescription) at cost plus 15%. The company’s mission is to reduce the complexity of the drug supply chain and charge the lowest possible prices while still making good profits. Among the list of available drugs is generic imatinib offered at $47 per month. Purchased through this process the price can now be as low as $565 per year which is relatively affordable and even cheaper than what a patient with prescription insurance might pay.

This is a model that physicians and patients should publicize encourage and use often. Similar companies are following the same model including Civica Rx ScriptCo Pharmacy Honeybee Pharmacy GeniusRx Ro Pharmacy and hopefully many others. Each has its variations but adheres to the common theme of bypassing intermediaries and providing the fastest and cheapest route for a drug from manufacturer to patient. A study in the Annals of Internal Medicine has estimated that Medicare could have saved conservatively $3.6 billion in 2020 had it purchased 77 generic drugs from Cuban’s Cost Plus Drug Company.

There are some downsides to this model as evidenced by Cost Plus. First most of the medications offered are generics and are only for chronic conditions. Second patients with chronic conditions are often on multiple medications and if they cannot obtain all their prescriptions through Cost Plus and need to use other pharmacies their prescriptions will be fragmented. And third Cost Plus does not bill insurance and patients will not be contributing to their deductibles.

These issues will hopefully be mitigated over time as the success of this model over the traditional distribution path encourages Cost Plus and similar companies to expand their inventories and accept insurance. By disrupting the traditional U.S. drug supply chain the “Mark Cuban effect” could significantly reduce the cost of drugs and health care in the U.S. in addition to making many much-needed cancer drugs available and affordable for more patients. This could save the lives of thousands of patients over the next decade.

The 'Amazon' of cars tumbles,"Carvana was once heralded as the future of the car-buying process. Shoppers could go online see detailed pictures of the car they wanted to buy complete the purchase online and then head to one of the company’s trendy car vending machines to pick up the vehicle. Or buyers could have cars shipped to their door. Carvana boomed during the pandemic as shoppers with loaded pockets from economic impact payments looked to take advantage of incredibly low interest rates and a no-contact method of purchasing a car. Unfortunately for Carvana things have changed drastically since the start of the pandemic causing its stock to plummet.

The pandemic created the perfect storm for Carvana to succeed. People had extra cash on hand low interest rates allowed people to get a lot more for their money and people wanted to purchase a used car without actually visiting a dealership. Being one of the first to offer an Amazon-styled way to purchase a vehicle Carvana was at the right place at the right time and grew.

While the pandemic isn’t exactly behind us Carvana doesn’t have the same prosperous tidings it once did. Used car prices are dropping rapidly especially luxury vehicles which appear to be in free fall interest rates are high and nearly every dealership (including Carmax) offers some kind of way to purchase a car online. Plus there’s talk of a recession though with inflation we’re practically already living in one. The abrupt way things went back to normal has caused Carvana’s stock to tank as it’s down nearly 97% from a year ago. On December 1 2021 Carvana was trading for nearly $282 while the stock now sits at $8.23.

A large 44% drop came right after Carvana released its quarterly results at the beginning of November. The company’s third-quarter results were pretty bad as Carvana’s revenue fell by 2.7% year-on-year. And the company’s net loss increased to $283 million compared to $32 million in the third quarter of last year reports The Street. For a company that’s trying to grow these figures are signs that the company is heading into a bad spell especially as used car sales continue to fall.

If things couldn’t get worse for Carvana the company recently announced that it would lay off 1500 employees or 8% of its workforce. This comes after the company cut 2500 jobs earlier this May. In an email to employees Carvana CEO Officer Ernie Garcia told workers that there were a few factors for the layoffs. “The first is that the economic environment continues to face strong headwinds and the near future is uncertain. This is especially true for fast-growing companies and for businesses that sell expensive often financed products where the purchase decision can be easily delayed likes cars” said Garcia. As the CEO put it Carvana “failed to accurately predict how this would all play out and the impact it would have on our business.”

It’s hard to say if Carvana will go out of business but Morgan Stanley via Business Insider stated that the company’s stock price could fall to $1 as used car prices and sales dropped at the beginning of November. But with everything that’s going on with the auto industry and the fact that the company is facing legal challenges from issues pertaining to registrations and titles with purchased vehicles Carvana looks like it has an uphill battle.

When James Michael Grimes fell overboard from a Carnival cruise ship in the Gulf of Mexico he said the sheer will to live along with strength from God kept him alive as he miraculously swam for what he believes was more than 15 hours.

Grimes 28 who described himself as an “average guy” who likes hunting fishing and being outdoors was rescued late on Thanksgiving Day and told CNN he is “blessed to be here.”

The Alabama native was onboard the Carnival Valor with 18 members of his family for the week of the Thanksgiving holiday. It was the night before Thanksgiving when Grimes who was at an onboard bar with his sister went to use a restroom around 11 p.m. his sister recalled according to a Carnival statement to CNN.

The last thing he remembers before regaining consciousness in the water was going to listen to live music aboard the ship with family he said and he doesn’t remember where or how he fell off the ship. He’d had drinks on the Valor but says he was not inebriated Grimes told ABC earlier.

“I was trying to stay as positive as I could from the moment I came to and regain consciousness I can just remember right then thinking ‘wow it’s a miracle that I’m not already dead’ ” Grimes said.

Grimes said he is not capable of floating and credited his survival to his faith and positive attitude adding he even created songs to keep his spirits up.

He swam through two schools of jellyfish and watched the sun rise during his time in the water and said he lost almost 20 pounds during the experience.

“The lord gave me the will to live. It’s a miracle” he told CNN. “I wasn’t going to give up at any point in time just say this is it this is the end. It never came to that. I was determined to swim until my arms and legs could not hold my body up anymore.”

“It was like a 20-hour baptism” he added.

He also battled confusion fatigue and some sort of creature below. “It came up on me really quick. And I went under and I could see it. And it wasn’t a shark I don’t believe. But it had more like a flat mouth and it came up and bumped one of my legs and I kicked it with the other leg. It scared me not knowing what it was … all I could see was a fin” he told ABC earlier.

At another point Grimes grabbed a floating stick which he said “looked like bamboo” and started chewing it. “It gave some type of flavor in my mouth other than saltwater” he told ABC.

Grimes also said he had conversations with God during his time in the Gulf.

“‘Lord my worst fear is drowning. I don’t know why you put me out here in this trial but I know you’re going to get me through it’ ” he recalled saying. “It wasn’t a matter of if I get saved or if they find me it was just a matter of when and I just got to keep swimming until they do.”

Grimes’ family had reported him missing at noon on Thanksgiving. He eventually saw lights from a tanker ship and swam toward it he had told ABC.

The ship’s crew spotted him around 8:25 p.m. and alerted the Coast Guard which sent a helicopter crew to hoist him out of the water the service said.

The Coast Guard member who rescued him looked like a guardian angel coming down from the helicopter Grimes told CNN.

Lt. Seth Gross a search and rescue coordinator for the USCG told CNN if Grimes was in the water for 15 hours it’s “the absolute longest that I’ve heard about and just one of those Thanksgiving miracles.”

“The fact that he was able to keep himself afloat and above the surface of the water for such an extended period of time it’s just something you can’t take for granted and certainly something that’ll stick with me forever” Gross said adding the case showed how much “the will to live is something that you need to account for in every search-and-rescue case.”

Grimes is now planning a trip to New Orleans to meet the Coast Guard crew who rescued him and added he wouldn’t rule out another cruise in the future.

“If that’s the worst thing I ever have to go through again I think I’ll be okay” Grimes said. “Being the Alabama fan that I am I was out there just rolling with the tide.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9jYXJuaXZhbC1jaG9jb2xhdGUtbWVsdGluZy1jYWtlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival's melting chocolate cake puts luxury cruise line desserts to shame,"Step aside baked Alaska. Only one dessert can rule the waves and it's not a 1950s throwback that's paraded around the dining room. It's Carnival's melting chocolate cake a dessert that's neither gimmicky nor unique but which Carnival does so well that it puts luxury cruise line desserts to shame.

Not only is this dessert worth ordering at least once during if not every night of your Carnival cruise but it's also simple to make at home when you want to wow guests or transport yourself back to an amazing vacation on a gray weeknight. We'll even give you the recipe.

Carnival's most popular dessert

On a Carnival cruise melting chocolate cake is essentially a lava cake or molten chocolate cake that has a firm top but is warm and runny inside. It's served in a ramekin like a souffle. The treat pairs perfectly with cool vanilla ice cream which cuts both the heat and the chocolate flavor — but eat quickly or your ice cream will melt on top of the cake.

The dessert is so popular that Carnival offers it every night of the cruise on its Always Available menu in the main dining room.

Interestingly Carnival offers a slightly different version of this dessert in its Chibang! restaurant found on Mardi Gras and Carnival Celebration. The Chocolate C-Bang is described as ""textured chocolate salted fudge ganache ginger and caramel ice cream."" In reality it was a stand-on-its-own chocolate cake with a moist center that tasted like a melting cake just with more flour to make it firmer and less runny.

Why is Carnival's melting chocolate cake so famous? I'm not a trained food critic but I find that chocolate cake is hard to get right in a restaurant setting. Often the cake itself is too dry or it's topped with frosting that's too sweet or layered with nuts or coconut or fruit filling that someone objects to. Carnival's melting chocolate cake is simple because it's all chocolate. The molten insides are designed so they're the opposite of dry.

The line's chefs have mastered this recipe; it always comes out the same way with that perfect crust of a top and the warm melty center. I've seen cruise lines mess up easy treats such as a skillet chocolate chip cookie dessert so I can assure you that it's trickier than you think to consistently turn out simple desserts at scale.

Please don't get me wrong — luxury cruise lines do desserts well. But sometimes they try too hard to make a treat that is complex or looks more impressive than it tastes. Personally I'll take a simple chocolate dessert done exceptionally well over some froufrou concoction with choux pastry and Chantilly cream an emulsion of this or a custard of that. Carnival's cake is a dessert with mass appeal (like the cruise line itself) taking simple ingredients and elevating them to something sublime.

Carnival melting chocolate cake recipe

CATHY SCOLA/GETTY IMAGES

Whether you're simply curious about how this decadent dessert is made or want to re-create it when you're landbound take a look at the melting chocolate cake recipe below. It involves only six ingredients most or all of which you have in your kitchen already. The only somewhat specialized items on the list are the ramekins; if you don't have any at home you can easily buy some online or at a home store such as Bed Bath & Beyond or Target.

Ingredients

6 ounces semisweet chocolate

3 ounces sweet chocolate (typically found as German's sweet chocolate; if you can't find it you can substitute 3 ounces of semisweet chocolate plus 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar)

6 ounces unsalted butter

4 eggs

3 ounces sugar (preferably fine or superfine sugar but regular granulated will work)

2 ounces all-purpose flour

Instructions

Melt the chocolate and butter together. (Be careful — chocolate is easy to burn!)

Whisk together the eggs and sugar for a few minutes.

Add the flour.

Add the melted chocolate to the egg mixture whisking while you pour to keep the warm chocolate from cooking the eggs.

Pour the batter evenly into four greased ramekins.

Arrange the ramekins on a rimmed baking tray and pour a little water around the bottom of the tray to create a water bath.

Bake the melting cakes in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.

Serve with vanilla ice cream and enjoy!

Don't trust your baking skills? For chefs on Carnival melting chocolate cake is easy. Watch as they show you how it's done.

Bottom line

You don't need to spend thousands on a cruise to try what might be the best dessert at sea. Carnival is among the most affordable cruise lines but its melting chocolate cake is a million-dollar treat — whether you try it at sea or bake it at home.

Cruzely was invited to sail on one of the first voyages. The seven-day cruise departed Miami headed to Cozumel Costa Maya and Mahogany Bay (Roatan). I’ll be live-blogging the experience each day to share what sailing the new ship is like.

You can view other days here:

So far the cruise aboard Carnival’s newest ship has been packed with so much happening. There was embarkation day and an initial day at sea to explore Carnival Celebration for the first time. That was followed by three days with three different ports. But as the ship makes the turn back to Miami after calling on Roatan we’ve had two days at sea before returning home.

That means two days to get in anything that you’ve wanted to do on the cruise but haven’t had the chance to just get to just yet.

To be sure having been on the ship for days and done a lot of things already it’s been a more relaxed vibe as we head back to home instead of feeling like we’ve got to do it all. So there’s been more time to just relax find those spots on the ship that turn into your second home (Loft 19 for us) and slow down a bit.

Unfortunately the weather hasn’t exactly cooperated.

Weather Pushes Things Inside (But Also Means a ‘Ship on a String’)

Day 6 saw some of the strongest winds I’ve seen at sea. And while the weather was relatively clear the wind made enjoying the outdoors tough to do. On the final day of the cruise the winds died down some but still were strong combined with occasional showers passing through. Of course I’d happily take a couple not-so-perfect weather days at sea if it means perfect weather in port like we saw on this trip.

But it has meant doing a bit more inside the ship than originally planned. Fortunately there’s been a lot going on.

In fact with plenty of time on our hands we made it a mission that we win one of the coveted “ships on a string.” If you aren’t familiar that’s the medal that Carnival gives to winners of contests on the ship.

In all my years of sailing I’ve never won a contest on a cruise ship. During these days at sea however there have been lots of trivia and games. So if not now then when?

We tried our hand at every type of trivia (general knowledge cartoons sports) and while we consistently placed around third or fourth there was always someone who managed to top us in every category.

That is until the last day of the cruise when there was a scavenger hunt about the historical mementos around the ship. Celebration was built with all sort of historical artifacts and touches that pay homage to Carnival’s 50 years of sailing. And they are all around the ship if you’re looking carefully (especially in The Golden Jubilee bar).

Paper in hand we took off around the ship snapping photos of the items on the list. And we made it back to the starting point in record time… only to find another team was already there with the answers and the host giving them the medal.

Beaten again. But then…

The host of the game seemed to take a little pity on us and when we showed her our answers and decided it was good enough to also award us a medal. I’m sure they give out hundreds of these each cruise but for the first time ever I can say that I won.

I’ll just leave out that it was second place.

Surf and Turf… and a Colorful Show

Of course the evenings have a lot going on around Celebration. The casino is packed music is playing around the ship and there’s always a buzz in the air.

We had dinner on Day 6 in the steakhouse onboard — Fahrenheit 555 ($48 per person). If you’re looking for a spot to splurge this is it. Located just off the main walkway on Deck 7 it’s actually easy to miss. Outside it just looks like a fancy bar but move past that and the room opens to the restaurant.

The menu features a full list of staples that you’d expect. Start off with oysters stuffed mushrooms pork belly lobster bisque or about a dozen other choices. For your entrée there are ribeye steaks lamb chops Chilean sea bass and plenty more. I opted for the surf and turf featuring a lobster tail mixed along with filet mignon.

On land I never go to steakhouses so to be able to do so on the ship was special. I also thought the meal was perfect. I couldn’t eat there every night (for my wallet or my waistline) but for a special event it was a wonderful time. The cheesecake for dessert certainly didn’t hurt either!

After dinner we headed over to check out one of Carnival’s new shows on Celebration — Color My World. Held in the Grand Spectrum Theater (the classic theater at the front of the ship) there was no issue with finding a seat like the other headline show (The Most Magnificent Circus) held at the stage in the center of the ship earlier in the cruise.

As you might guess from the name this show is all about color. It is performances of songs focused on colors (Paint It Black Purple Rain Yellow etc.) but all given a twist compared to the originals. Then there is a new element with large video screens at the back of the stage that serves as the set background. Compared to traditional stage sets the technology really adds another level to the performance especially given the focus on colors.

In all the performance was very good though the circus show earlier in the week is the one that I’d say you absolutely can’t miss. Also if you make this show… be ready for the surprise at the end!

The Final Verdict on Sailing Carnival Celebration

So after a full week on Carnival Celebration exploring everything onboard eating at nearly every restaurant and going to almost every show what’s the final verdict on the ship?

First I can say that it’s unlike any other Carnival ship I’ve sailed. From the size to the amenities restaurants and things to do this class of ship (along with Mardi Gras) is a major change from the rest of the fleet. Even compared to the newer ships in the Vista class it’s a big difference.

For instance when it comes to dining you have options that just aren’t found on other ships (Street Eats ChiBang! Big Chicken Rudi’s and more). And most of these are included in your cruise fare. During this trip I ate at the same spot only once or twice the entire 7-day cruise. That’s almost unheard of on a cruise.

Then there are four different pools open to everyone plus a private pool in Loft 19 and another in the Havana area. The waterpark at the back of the ship is larger with more slides than I’ve seen on other Carnival ships. Lounges hangouts bars and other venues are everywhere so that no matter what atmosphere you’re looking for there’s something for you.

I don’t see how you can be bored on this ship with so much going on. It also does a good job of mixing classic Carnival venues that people love while also offering a lot that’s new compared to other classes. So you get that mix of favorites compared with some things that I think will become new favorites.

Is everything perfect? No there are definitely some things that caught my eye. For one while the ship is larger I do find it to be much more crowded. The flow of people around the ship has some chokepoints and it can sometimes feel hard to navigate (especially in the first days where you’re learning the layout).

As well other logistics like the theater in Celebration Central not having enough seating for the popular shows and slow elevators added to the “crowded” feel.

But if you’re a Carnival fan and wondering if Celebration is right for you I think it stays true to the Carnival roots while also offering so much more than other ships in the fleet. This class of ship is a major step forward… and one that I don’t think you want to miss. Having sailed for a week it was an amazing time. I think you’d have one too.

Interesting Observations

If you’ve followed along with this trip then you might be wondering about one big feature that hasn’t been mentioned… BOLT — the roller coaster on Carnival Celebration. Our plan was to ride it when at sea on the way back to Miami. Unfortunately with the wind both days at sea the ride didn’t operate. Moral of the story: If you know that you want to do the roller coaster then sign up and do it as soon as you can (it’s $15 per person for a ride). You never know what the weather may bring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlcmFkaW8ubmV0L2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLWd1ZXN0LXdhbnRzLW9uYm9hcmQtY3JlZGl0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Guest Wants Onboard Credit Here's Why,"Generally the question of just how much a human life is worth is the type of question best left to philosophers. But one woman’s letter to Carnival Cruise Line Brand Ambassador John Heald seemed to suggest not only the value of a life but that the life of a crew member might not carry the same value as that of a cruise passenger.

We Feel His Frustration

In a video post Heald took a moment to address a complaint he’d received from a Carnival Cruise Line guest disappointed that their visit to Cozumel had been cut short by a medical emergency. The passenger in question suggested that guests should receive a $150 onboard credit to compensate for the inconvenience.

“What made it particularly frustrating from a human level” said a clearly exasperated Heald “was the sentence that said ‘We should be receiving some OBC for this especially as the person taken off was a crew member.'”

Read that last sentence again and process the meaning of the letter-writer’s words. “Does that human life become less important because that person was a crew member?” continued Heald. “Well the simple answer to that is no.”

Heald acknowledged that having any aspect of one’s cruise negatively impacted might be disappointing. But he added “Is $150 the price that you would put on saving the life of somebody who had been serving or entertaining you throughout the cruise?”

We’re All In This Together

We’ll take that a step further and ask if that’s the price the letter writer would put on saving the life of anyone including fellow passengers.

Spend any time on cruise-related message boards or Facebook pages and you’ll see an endless litany of recently-disembarked guests suggesting that they should have received some form of compensation for things that went wrong during their trip.

From missed ports to bad weather — and yes some actually hold cruise lines responsible for Mother Nature’s storm-causing temper tantrums — some amongst us expect to be rewarded for their inconvenience.

To be fair some of those requests seem reasonable. But like Heald the suggestion that someone should be compensated because of the misfortune of another left a bad taste in our mouth crew member or not.

Every single time we get on a ship we’re grateful. Cruising is a privilege an escape and something that not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to do. And yes it can be annoying when a port is skipped or an activity is canceled.

But in the grand scheme of things is it really that big of a deal?

There’s a group of cruisers who spend a lot of time talking about how different lines “nickel-and-dime” them. We hear their rallying cry whenever the daily gratuity rate goes up or something which was previously free suddenly has a charge. Of course we get it. Everybody wants to get the best value possible for every hard-earned vacation dollar.

But is it really appropriate to turn the tables by suggesting that we are owed something because our trip was impacted by someone else’s misfortune?

As Heald so simply put it the answer to that is no.

(Bloomberg) –Dirty bulk ships used to carry iron ore are being scrubbed clean so that they can transport grain to Asia in an unusual shift of cargoes prompted by a slump in demand for the steelmaking ingredient.

China’s downturn in the housing market has weighed on iron ore driving freight rates for bulk carriers down 50% from a year earlier. That’s made it more attractive for some of the world’s biggest agriculture traders to book iron ore vessels for shipments of corn and soybeans.

While the number of such cargo switches are relatively small it’s the latest shift by traders wrestling with dramatic changes in commodities markets sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s weakening economy. The war created extreme volatility in global grain markets allowing trading houses such as Cargill Inc. to post bumper profits.

Large iron ore ships typically stay away from grain as it involves a time-consuming cleaning processto make the vessels safe for carrying food. Washing a huge cargo hold dirty from iron ore is a necessary step to ensure that consumers of the grain — humans or other animals — don’t ingest rust metallic sand or dirt.

Before picking up grain cleaning gangs first have to lower themselves by winch into black-stained cargo holds. They then blast water and chemicals at high pressure against the walls before using brushes to scrub out gunk and then siphon the muddy water away.

The deep-cleaning process can cost between $7000 and $8000 and require a few extra days of chartering according to one trader. This could extend to a week and require shipyard workers to sand down and repaint the walls if the dirty coating can’t be removed.

The ships of choice are Baby Capes the smallest of Capesize vessels with capacity to carry about 100000 tons. That’s much bigger than Panamax bulk vessels that normally carry grain and hold about 60000 tons.

The depressed iron ore trade this year could be pushing Baby Capes to seek “alternative employment” said Ralph Leszczynski head of research at shipbroker Banchero Costa & Co.

The main allure for switching is price despite the extra cleaning cost. In the first 10 months of this year it was cheaper to hire a Capesize vessel than a Panamax by an average of $5200 per day the most for that time period since data going back to 1999 according to Arrow Shipbroking Group.

China’s COFCO International Ltd. and US-based Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and Cargill have booked about four Baby Capes to deliver grain to Asia next year from South America said people with knowledge of the matter. ADM declined to comment.

COFCO International said it has recently booked its first Baby Cape vessels to transport soymeal from Brazil to Southeast Asia next year.

“Initially it comes down to simple economies of scale — the more we load the cheaper the freight cost is for our customers and the lower the carbon footprint” said Alessio La Rosa global head of freight at COFCO International.

A spokesperson for Cargill said it routinely uses Baby Capes for grain and other shipments and expects to see more of such vessels in the future.

In late October IPP Air Cargo cancelled its application to launch what would have been the nation’s first cargo airline although the company had already completed the procedures to lease four Boeing Converted Freighters 737 800BCF.

Jonathan Hanh Nguyen chairman of the airline’s parent company Imex Pan Pacific Group (IPPG) told VnExpress that global air cargo demand was declining due to current turmoil.

""We have decided to end our plan to avoid causing more damage to carriers that are already incurring losses"" he said adding that the company aimed to reinstate the plan when the market stabilizes.

Last month Lufthansa launched its first direct flight from Frankfurt to Hanoi.

The carrier had previously run two flights per week from Germany to HCMC before diverting operations to Thailand.

CCO Ashwin Bhat said his airline could not ignore the Vietnamese market where 30% of exported items are electronics and high-tech goods Thanh Nien reported.

Vietnam’s plentiful bilateral trade agreements with major markets especially Europe were attractive to Luftnasa said Bhat.

He added that the country's rapid economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic had also interested the dominant European airline.

According to government statistics the total volume of goods transported by air in Vietnam has increased 2.5 times over the last ten years. The number is forecasted to surge to 4.1 million tons by 2030.

According to the Vietnam Logistics Business Association (VLA) Vietnamese airlines hold an international freight forwarding market share of only 12% while nearly 30 foreign carriers hold the rest.

VLA president Le Duy Hiep said the withdrawal of IPP Air Cargo from the market was a pity because domestic logistics enterprises are in dire need of Vietnamese cargo airlines.

According to Hiep Vietnam’s massive amount of total imports and exports were worth over $700 billion in 2022 with over half being exports. Over two million tons of goods are exported by air from Vietnam each year.

Analysts have said that these factors have made the potential of the Vietnamese cargo market plain to see for Lufthansa Cargo.

Hiep said Vietnam should be home to cargo airlines with larger market shares but noted that this would require much more investment and a wider network of agents and customers."

And that may signal trouble for some local commercial real estate.

Bustling activity at the standalone restaurant is a surprise to some property executives because the building was supposed to be demolished by now to make way for a 27-story tower that would serve as the new corporate home of CBRE Group the world's largest commercial real estate brokerage by revenue. Multiple real estate sources have told CoStar News the proposed project at 2401 McKinney Ave. appears stalled amid rising interest rates and inflation.

The lack of progress is a rare hiccup for a metropolitan area that has been the national leader in luring companies that promise to invest millions of dollars and create thousands of jobs. Goldman Sachs for example is expected to employ at least 5000 workers at its new $500 million office campus in Uptown Dallas that is scheduled to break ground early next year.

""Right now to get something completed from start to finish you need a proven development team with a sophisticated lender with more equity than usual and it has to be a strong deal"" said Jack Matthews a developer experienced in working with the city of Dallas on projects and familiar with area development but not affiliated with the CBRE project. ""In the past other deals were getting done but I think it's going to be two to five years before we get back to those deals. There's a lot of uncertainty in the market right now.""

Construction was supposed to begin on CBRE's proposed 750000-square-foot office tower this past February according to a state permit. Not only has construction not begun but Truluck's is still taking reservations well into next year. At this rate the project might not meet the construction timeline spelled out in an incentive agreement between CBRE and the city of Dallas and that could imperil the brokerage's access to some public funds real estate professionals say.

The brokerage signed a formal agreement with the city of Dallas one year ago for the proposed tower helping the brokerage secure about $4 million in state and local economic incentives in exchange for meeting certain guidelines. Some of those guidelines include CBRE leasing at least 200000 square feet for its global headquarters at the new office tower that would be developed by Dallas-based Trammell Crow Co. CBRE's U.S. development arm.

The agreement specifies that the new tower must be constructed by the end of 2024 with CBRE taking occupancy no later than the end of 2025. With a little more than two years to complete a project that general contractors say would take 2 1/2 maybe even three years to develop real estate professionals say it seems unlikely CBRE will meet the construction milestones laid out in the incentive package.

CBRE declined to comment to CoStar News on the status of the project. A Trammell Crow spokeswoman also declined to comment. The city of Dallas has not received an update from CBRE on the project since the formal agreement was signed Dec. 1 2021 a city official told CoStar News.

Even so the deadline is still years away and there's no certainty that the firm won't either complete the project on time seek to negotiate changes to push back deadlines to qualify for the incentives or forgo the incentives if it should miss the deadline for construction.

Economic Shifts

A lot has changed in the past year since Dallas-based CBRE signed the agreement with construction costs escalating and upending capital markets leading the brokerage to take significant cost-cutting measures including laying off an unknown number of employees. The firm plans to cut $400 million of spending much of that tied to trimming its workforce by mid-2023.

CBRE's proposed new tower had an initial $200 million estimated cost at least at the time a state permit was filed in July 2021. Trammell Crow first started collecting construction bids for the project in August 2020 according to construction documents obtained by CoStar News at the time.

Trammell Crow told a neighborhood watchdog group in September 2020 it had the tower's financing in place. But fast forward more than two years later and those construction bids and financing are probably inadequate with what is required to develop the same skyscraper today because of increased construction materials and labor costs industry professionals say.

If the project is on hold it may be difficult for CBRE to move forward with its agreed-upon incentives with the city of Dallas said Larry Hamilton chairman and CEO of Hamilton Properties Corp. Hamilton who has worked through incentive agreements with the city on various projects but is not affiliated with the CBRE project said ""the city will require them to get an extension and go through a bunch of hoops. It won't be the simplest thing in the world to get the extension.""

The city of Dallas approved a $250000 economic incentive in exchange for CBRE building and leasing space at the new tower creating hundreds of jobs and forming internship programs with local colleges and universities. In addition CBRE was eligible to receive $3.45 million from the Texas Enterprise Fund to invest more than $29 million in its Dallas headquarters and create 460 new jobs. The deal which also included additional funds for CBRE to expand its operations center in Richardson Texas marked the first time the state's deal-closing fund offered economic incentives to a real estate brokerage.

The agreement with the state did not specify the address of where CBRE planned to invest in its Dallas headquarters. CBRE's headquarters has been at 2100 McKinney Ave. in Uptown Dallas since 2020 when it relocated its main corporate home from Los Angeles. The proposed development site of CBRE's new headquarters is located one block north of the brokerage's existing headquarters.

Uptown Dallas is one of the city's most sought-after neighborhoods for office space in proximity to luxury property such as The Ritz-Carlton hotel and residences and the occasional streetcar tooting its presence to pedestrians. CBRE rivals including JLL Cushman & Wakefield Newmark and Avison Young have offices in the walkable upscale neighborhood. McKinney Avenue is known for having the city's priciest office rents per square foot. Uptown has a vacancy rate of 15.6% slightly lower than the city's average of 17.4% according to CoStar data.

But Uptown faces headwinds as office tenants reevaluate leases because of work-from-home trends having an uncertain effect on future office demand. The uncertainty of the future of office space has likely played a role in slowing progress on CBRE's proposed new tower industry professionals say.

Lending Tightens

CBRE is expected to lease about 25% of the office space at the proposed new tower leaving about a half-million square feet without a tenant and on the balance sheet at a time when the company is scaling back. Lending has tightened since early September causing CBRE's sales and loan originations to fall sharply in the third quarter and cloud the brokerage's earnings. CBRE is planning to cut $300 million in costs related to reducing its headcount the company said in its third-quarter earnings report.

Other major new office projects are underway in Uptown including two being developed by Dallas-area developers. Granite Properties broke ground on 23Springs in June and Dallas-based Harwood International broke ground on Harwood No. 14 in 2021.

King White president and CEO of Dallas-based Site Selection Group said the uncertain economic climate hitting companies throughout the United States would probably give CBRE some traction in renegotiating its performance-driven economic incentive agreement with the city and state.

The agreement between the city of Dallas and CBRE has a force majeure clause an “act of God” provision that became a bigger part of real estate negotiations during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic a so-called act of God was typically tied to a war natural disaster or other uncontrollable circumstances to free landlords or tenants from being held liable to lease terms. It is not clear if the force majeure clause in CBRE's agreement in which the city is allowed to extend deadlines in certain circumstances could come into play possibly as a negotiating tactic with the brokerage's new headquarters.

White who isn't involved in CBRE's economic incentives said the firm wouldn't be the only company seeking to renegotiate its economic incentive agreement with shifts to remote work causing some issues with compliance with full-time employees often tied to working in a specific place or city in order to receive incentives.

For example the city of Plano a suburb north of Dallas redid its incentive agreement last year to accommodate for JPMorgan's remote work policy. JPMorgan received nearly $5 million in incentives from the city of Plano where it has a 1.5 million-plus-square-foot campus and 4500 employees in an agreement stemming from 2016.

In addition the rise in construction costs and tight labor conditions have also upended compliance of incentives agreed to years ago King said.

""The office sector is not very stable right now with financing being difficult to secure"" King added. ""We are expecting interest rates to remain high and continue to escalate for another year at least.""

Meanwhile the food keeps coming at Truluck's in the 14063-square-foot site on McKinney Avenue where it has operated since 2015. Truluck's was expected to anchor the ground-floor retail portion of CBRE's new office tower once built.

Schuman Companies a real estate investment firm in Windsor paid $15 million for the north parcel of the property at the intersection of Interstate 25 and U.S. 34. Schuman announced the sale Nov. 21 and is expected to close later on the south parcel of the mall.

Philip Schuman the company’s chief financial officer said in a statement that “We are excited for the opportunity to reinvent the Outlets.”

The city of Loveland is looking forward to a makeover for what was once a major shopping attraction.

“When they opened they were essentially one of the largest draws for the region for retail” said Scott Schorling the city’s business development project manager.

The roughly 36-acre outlet mall opened in 1994 well ahead of a number of shopping centers that have since popped up along the fast-growing northern I-25 corridor. Schuman Companies and CBRE Group the real estate firm that arranged the sale said the plan is to rename the mall Loveland Yards and offer retail and office spaces for lease or sale.

Schuman and CBRE didn’t disclose the mall’s seller. But Larimer County property records listed Craig Realty Group Loveland as the owner.

On its website Craig Realty Group in Newport Beach Calif. lists the Loveland mall among its shopping centers. The company’s other Colorado properties are the Outlets at Silverthorne and the Outlets at Castle Rock.

Craig Realty didn’t return a request for comment.

In 2007 The Denver Post reported that many of the storefronts at the Loveland mall were vacant. At the time Craig Realty said it was investing more than $20 million in its three Colorado shopping centers to reverse what it called years of mismanagement by previous owners. Coach and a Nike Factory Store were two of the new tenants announced then.

In October all that was left of the Nike store was the outline of the brand’s well-known swoosh trademark on the side of the building. The few remaining tenants included a mattress store two churches a used-car business wellness clinic and the Loveland Scout Shop.

The floor-to-ceiling windows on storefront after storefront revealed empty spaces or in a few cases items on shelves that had not been cleared out.

While the Outlets at Loveland struggled new shopping centers were built in neighboring areas Schorling said. One of those is Centerra Marketplace with more than 40 stores just to the west of the outlet mall and the Promenade Shops at Centerra.

“I think that has been one of the biggest challenges for the center since it was constructed so long ago essentially staying relevant in the retail landscape.”

And there wasn’t “a whole lot of reinvestment in the property” he added.

The restrictions on businesses during the height of the coronavirus pandemic appeared to further the center’s decline.

“I remember having a conversation with one of the property managers who said if they were going to keep them locked down in 2020 through the holiday season it was really going to be a death knell for the outlet mall” Schorling said.

When the Nike store closed in 2021 Schorling said he thinks the mall’s owner started looking at its options.

Business at retail centers including outlet malls is on the rebound from the pandemic-induced downturn according to Placer.ai which provides analysis of foot traffic based on data from devices enabled to share the information. Visits to outlet malls rose 7.5% from September to October in the face of such headwinds as inflation Placer.ai said.

In a brochure advertising Loveland Yards Schuman Companies plays up the currently closed mall as one of northern Colorado’s “most central accessible and highly visible locations.”

Melissa Moran and Jon Rue with CBRE’s Fort Collins office arranged the sale and are marketing the property for sale and lease. Rue first vice president said in a statement that the site has more property fronting I-25 than most other commercial properties in the area.

Schuman’s plans would fill a specific need for the area’s small business community which is the ability to own their own real estate according to CBRE. The spaces can be reconfigured to fit individual requirements.

A half-million people live within 15 miles of the outlet mall including the communities of Loveland Greeley Fort Collins and Windsor according to CBRE.

Schorling who met with the new owners Wednesday said the company is “soft marketing the property” and has received good responses. He said the city and company have talked about ways to make the mall a regional draw including a focus on entertainment or a common area for dining.

“We saw this corner as a retail gateway into the city and so it’s really important to us that it keeps that goal” Schorling said.",,,,,,

Kay Ivey U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt and other state and community leaders joined with representatives of telecommunications giant Spectrum on Nov. 21 to celebrate construction on a fiber-optic network that will ultimately bring gigabit broadband and other services to more than 6500 homes and small businesses in Walker County.

“My administration has prioritized expanding access to reliable high-speed internet service for families and businesses throughout Alabama” Ivey said at the Old Harbin Hotel in Nauvoo. “Today we celebrate breaking ground on Spectrum’s public-private partnership with the state to advance broadband connectivity in rural Walker County.”

Aderholt added “For many years we have been working to close the digital divide across the state and country and this expansion by Spectrum is a big step toward doing so. Many of my constituents here in Alabama’s Fourth District feel the strain every day of not having access to high-speed reliable broadband and I am excited to see great progress like this.”

The network buildout is partially attributed to a $4.95 million grant by the Alabama Department of Community and Economic Affairs (ADECA) that has been awarded to Spectrum to connect more than 2100 unserved locations.

“I am thrilled that Spectrum received an ADECA grant to expand its services to Nauvoo and other unserved parts of Walker County” said State Rep. Matt Woods of Jasper said. “It opens the door for new business opportunities and for residents to be more connected and to work and learn from home.”

The ADECA grant is being paired with ongoing rural expansion through the Federal Communications Commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) which paves the way for Spectrum to provide fiber connectivity to the unserved locations in Walker County. The company’s total RDOF expansion will provide broadband access to approximately 1 million customer locations as estimated by the FCC across 24 states in the coming years.

“Broadband is a vital resource for work learning and personal connection” said Spectrum’s Area Vice President Tony Sieiro. “Leveraging resources won in the ADECA grant process and RDOF auction we’re building a high-speed high-capacity network that will bring gigabit internet to thousands of homes and small businesses in Walker County; an investment that will ensure families and businesses can participate fully in the digital world now and well into the future.”

Spectrum serves more than 652000 customers across 238 communities in Alabama.

“The state of Alabama has made historic strides toward expanding internet access to all Alabamians regardless of ZIP code” said State Sen. Greg Reed said. “We’ve seen unprecedented investments and public-private partnerships just like with Spectrum here in Walker County that are resulting in efficient and expeditious deployment of high-speed internet access to our most rural pockets of the state.”

Spectrum offers a suite of advanced communications services including television wireless and internet offered by Charter Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) which serves more than 32 million residential and business customers in 41 states. The company distributes news and sports programming to customers through Spectrum Networks.

CVX,Chevron Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVneXB0dG9kYXkuY29tL0FydGljbGUvMy8xMjEwODgvVVMtQ2hldnJvbi1kaXNjb3ZlcnMtMy01dGNmLWdhcy13ZWxsLWluLUVneXB00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Chevron discovers 3.5tcf gas well in Egypt,"CAIRO - 4 December 2022: US Chevron Corporation announced the discovery of a new gas well called ""Narges-1X"" in the offshore Narges area near Al-Arish in Egypt according to the MEES newsletter.

The Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) is a weekly newsletter published by Middle East Petroleum and Economic Publications Ltd.

The Narges offshore block (in which Chevron operates at 45 percent Eni 45 percent and state-run company Tharwa at 10 percent) discovered 3.5 trillion cubic feet of gas a source told MEES.

The well is being drilled by the Stena Forth drillship.

“Narges-1X"" has encountered gas at its primary target depth of 3980ms. The discovery will be a huge boost to Egypt which has seen its output fall from a peak of 7.2 billion cfd last September to 6.5 billion cfd for the third qyarter (Q3)” the newsletter added.

In June the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company ""EGAS"" and Chevron Corporation signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to cooperate in the activities of transporting importing and liquefying the export of East Mediterranean gas.

Chevron which is an American multinational energy corporation drilled its first exploration well in its concession area in the Mediterranean Sea in September.

Moreover Chevron affirmed its readiness to play an active role and cooperate with regard to projects to improve the environmental conditions of the energy industry.

According to the agreement the two companies assess the potential opportunities to transfer the gas available in the eastern Mediterranean to Egypt to maximize its value by liquefying it to be re-exported and sold; so that it is economically feasible for both parties; including conducting any necessary study for the production of low carbon LNG.

Chevron participates with its investments in the search for gas in the western Mediterranean in the regions north of Sidi Barani Narges and North El Dabaa and in Sector 1 in the Red Sea which it won in the first bid put forward by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources for the development and exploitation of oil and gas in the Red Sea regions in addition to the activity of marketing high-quality oils.

Egypt's exports of natural and liquefied gas amounted to about $8 billion in the fiscal year 2021/2022 according to a cabinet statement.

Previously Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said that Egypt earns about $500 million per month from natural gas exports and aims to raise that number to $1 billion in the coming period.



The government has implemented a plan to rationalize electricity consumption in order to provide natural gas used in the stations in order to export it abroad in light of the high global prices.

Egypt's exports of natural gas rose after starting to implement a plan to rationalize electricity consumption in August according to what Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said in mid-September.

The Cabinet amended the method of calculating the selling prices of natural gas for nitrogenous fertilizer factories to become according to a new price equation so that it is not less than $4.5 per million British thermal units.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vY2FuYWRhLmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy9wYXJrbGFuZC1kb3VibGUtc2l6ZS1hbm5vdW5jZWQtZXYtY2hhcmdpbmctbmV0d29yay13ZXN0ZXJuLWNhbmFkYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Parkland to double size of announced EV charging network in western Canada,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://canada.autonews.com/electric-vehicles/parkland-double-size-announced-ev-charging-network-western-canada on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vY2FuYWRhLmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy9wYXJrbGFuZC1kb3VibGUtc2l6ZS1hbm5vdW5jZWQtZXYtY2hhcmdpbmctbmV0d29yay13ZXN0ZXJuLWNhbmFkYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vbm5wYy1jbmwtc2VjdXJlcy0xLTRibi1pbmZpbGwtZHJpbGxpbmctZmluYW5jaW5nLXByb2dyYW1tZS_SAVNodHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL25ucGMtY25sLXNlY3VyZXMtMS00Ym4taW5maWxsLWRyaWxsaW5nLWZpbmFuY2luZy1wcm9ncmFtbWUvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NNPC CNL secure $1.4bn infill drilling financing programme,"Chevron Nigeria Limited operator of the joint venture between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and CNL has secured a $1.4bn financing to fund the NNPC/CNL JV infill drilling programme to run from 2022 to 2026.

A statement by CNL’s General Manager

Policy Government and Public Affairs Esimaje Brikinn on Friday said the financing arrangement was executed on Wednesday November 30 2022.

The project included the drilling of 37 wells in the offshore and onshore Escravos area.

According to the statement the project would help to monetise reserves and increase production by arresting decline and supporting domestic gas supply adding that the project aligns with the NNPC/CNL JV’s lower carbon ambitions and helps support a lower carbon future through increased gas resources for commercialisation.

“The NNPC/CNL JV recognises the strategic imperative to supplement funding of the NNPC/CNL JV operations to enable high impact projects that can deliver near term production” it said.

The NNPC/CNL JV is one of the largest producers and investors in Nigeria. CNL has operated in Nigeria for more than 60 years and the firm said it was still committed to supporting the country in developing its energy resources for the benefit of its people.

When it comes to stocks with the potential for a stock split Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 0.19%) is one that tops the list. At approximately $1550 per share its price potentially places whole shares out of reach for small investors. But does that mean a stock split will happen? And would a split actually boost Chipotle stock? Let's take a closer look.

Stock splits and Chipotle

Undoubtedly Chipotle's stock price alone makes it a candidate for a stock split. Almost 8500 stocks trade on the leading U.S. exchanges today. Of those stocks Chipotle ranks seventh in terms of its nominal price.

Chipotle shareholders have enjoyed a long but profitable climb to that level. The stock debuted in January 2006. After anticipating an IPO price in the $18 per share to $20 per share range it closed at $44 per share on its first day of trading. That was just the beginning as the stock has handily outperformed the S&P 500.

However after nearly 16 years of trading it has never split its shares. It has also not announced any plans to initiate a split.

Why a split does not necessarily help Chipotle

Still a stock split would change nothing for Chipotle on the surface. One share valued at $1550 would hold the same value as 10 at $155 per share for example.

Not all high-priced stocks split ultimately. Berkshire Hathaway's A shares have never split despite an approximate $475000 share price. And for every Amazon and Alphabet that has decided to split its shares the market offers an AutoZone or Booking Holdings that has maintained its high nominal share prices.

Moreover the high share price does not change the fact that Chipotle is poised to do just fine. Revenue for the first nine months of 2022 was $6.5 billion. That grew 16% compared with the same period in 2021.

Net income surged 30% to $675 million during the same timeframe. Despite higher inflation Chipotle kept operating expense growth at 13% allowing for faster earnings growth.

Furthermore Chipotle sells for 55 times its earnings. That may seem pricey considering the average price-to-earnings ratio of 21 for the S&P 500. Still that multiple is near a low point last seen in the bear market of early 2020. And a split would not affect the earnings multiple as lower share prices mean a proportional reduction in earnings for each share.

How Chipotle can benefit from a split

Nonetheless Chipotle could benefit from a split indirectly. As mentioned earlier a lower share price might prompt more small investors to take an interest.

Indeed investors can buy fractional shares of Chipotle. However rules for such shares vary by broker assuming they offer fractional shares at all. And buying such shares may involve fees that do not apply to whole shares.

Higher share prices also tend to lower liquidity. Only about 2800 Berkshire A shares trade on an average day well below Amazon's 74 million average daily volume. And since only about 300000 Chipotle shares exchange hands on an average day a lower share price would likely boost activity in the stock.

Do not count on a split

Ultimately Chipotle's management has shown no interest in a split. Thus interested investors should buy fractional shares or save cash to afford whole shares.

Admittedly a stock split could boost the restaurant stock on the margins. Nonetheless the earnings growth rates and comparatively low P/E ratio bode well for investors regardless of Chipotle's nominal stock price. Thus investors should focus on those factors instead of the stock price.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vazJyYWRpby5jb20vZGVzaGF1bi13YXRzb24tcmV0dXJucy1mcm9tLWJhbi1kZWNsaW5lcy10by1leHByZXNzLXJlbW9yc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deshaun Watson Returns From Ban Declines to Express Remorse,"HOUSTON (AP) — Deshaun Watson signed autographs posed for selfies ignored the boos and earned a sloppy win.

Again he declined to express remorse for behavior that earned him an 11-game suspension.

Back in his old home to play his first game in 700 days Watson showed plenty of rust debuting with Cleveland but the Browns didn’t need him to do much in a 27-14 victory over the Houston Texans on Sunday.

After signing jerseys for Texans and Browns fans and taking pictures with a few more before the game Watson was overwhelmed with boos once it started. He heard jeers before each snap in the first half and for much of the afternoon.

“They’re supposed to boo. I’m a Cleveland Brown now” Watson said.

Watson has been accused by more than two dozen women of sexual harassment and assault during massage sessions. He has settled 23 civil lawsuits brought by the women while two others including one filed in October are pending.

Asked if he felt remorseful for his actions in his return to Houston Watson said his legal team told him not to address questions about his suspension.

“Of course it was a tough situation” he said. “The suspension was tough but at the same time my main focus was just to try to be 1-0 as a football player today.”

Pressed further Watson said: “I was just excited to be back on the field today. I did everything I was asked was required to do. I did all that.”

Watson had several supporters in the stands before the game while a group of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct also planned to attend. Attorney Tony Buzbee who represents the women didn’t respond to a text message seeking to confirm their attendance. He said earlier in the week about 10 women wanted to attend “to kind of make the statement ’Hey we’re still here. We matter.’”

One fan walked into NRG Stadium wearing a derogatory shirt in Browns colors that includes text saying “I need a massage.” He was joined by a fan wearing Watson’s No. 4 Browns jersey.

Fans in the parking lot set up a fake massage table with a mannequin wearing a red Texans jersey and a towel.

The few fans in their seats when Watson and the Browns jogged onto the field about an hour before kickoff booed.

“It is what it is” Watson said of the boos. “I can’t control what the fans do. My job is to go out there and execute.”

He didn’t do that too well.

Watson finished 12-of-22 passing for 131 yards and one interception. The three-time Pro Bowl quarterback posted the worst passer rating of his NFL career at 53.4. The Browns (5-7) got two defensive touchdowns and a special teams score to beat the Texans (1-10-1).

After an interception gave the Browns their first possession at their 43 Watson threw two incomplete passes. He spun away from a sack on third down and fans cheered when his throw to David Bell hit the ground.

Watson’s first completed pass on his third attempt resulted in a turnover when Anthony Schwartz fumbled after a 12-yard gain. Watson later drove the Browns to Houston’s 11 before throwing a pick in the end zone.

“We don’t expect him to be Superman after he hasn’t played in two years” All-Pro defensive end Myles Garrett said.

Watson sat out the 2021 season after demanding a trade from Houston. After two grand juries in Texas declined to indict him over allegations of sexual harassment and assault the Browns traded several draft picks to get Watson and then signed him to a fully guaranteed $235 million contract.

During warmups Watson signed jerseys for fans behind the end zone. An 18-year-old man from East Texas got Watson’s autograph on his Browns jersey. A couple from Houston wearing Texans jerseys also got Watson’s signature on their jerseys.

“We don’t really know what happened and everyone deserves a second chance” said Sherry Holden explaining her support.

Several Browns fans said they were uncomfortable rooting for Watson.

“I’m cheering for the jersey and the team but it’s hard to accept him as my quarterback” said Brandon Collins who traveled from Ohio for the game.

The NFL wanted to suspend Watson for at least one season but settled for 11 games after an independent arbiter initially gave him a six-game ban. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell pointed to former U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson calling Watson’s behavior “egregious” and “predatory” in seeking the full suspension.

Watson also was fined $5 million and required to undergo professional counseling and therapy. Watson has maintained his innocence but also apologized to the women he impacted and

The Browns went 4-7 with veteran Jacoby Brissett filling in for Watson.

Coach Kevin Stefanski committed to starting Watson next week and emphasized him getting his first game out of the way.

“He looked very sharp in practice and he’s excited for the next one so he understood this one was going to be different"" Stefanski said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzA0L2FyZS1zYWxlc2ZvcmNlLWludmVzdG9ycy1yZWFjdGluZy10by10aGUtd3JvbmctdGhpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Salesforce Investors Reacting to the Wrong Thing?,"Plus a bull vs. bear debate about DigitalOcean.

Chris Hill: Another co-CEO bites the dust and we've got a bull-vs.-bear debate on cloud infrastructure. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me Motley Fool senior analyst Emily Flippen. Thanks for being here.

Emily Flippen: Thanks for having me Chris.

Hill: It was one year ago today on our MarketFoolery podcast that the lead story was Salesforce. The company's third-quarter results were really good and they were overshadowed by the news that CEO Marc Benioff was being joined by Bret Taylor as co-CEO. Here we are one year later and once again Salesforce's third-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected and this is getting overshadowed again Emily by the news that Taylor is leaving the company. We will get to the results in a minute but I'm struck by the fact that for the second time in less than three years a co-CEO is leaving Marc Benioff and Salesforce.

Flippen: Benioff sounded sad about it in his commentary. It makes me wonder if it was never quite a great relationship to begin with but you certainly do feel bad for Marc Benioff now re-entering the role of sole as CEO. He is the co-founder of Salesforce so he has been there since the beginning for this company. But Bret Taylor was an operational CEO if you will to match Benioff's visionary tendencies. Certainly the market did not appreciate this departure not only because the tenure was so short but also because it raised the questions of well what's going on behind the scenes in these relationships? Is Salesforce losing some of the operational capacity that they had with Taylor? It's a big question mark for Salesforce right now but we do know that Benioff is a strong leader. The results from Salesforce were strong as well. Within its own I don't think it changes the investment thesis for investors in this company but it certainly raises some yellow flags.

Hill: We were talking before we started recording. You pointed out that there's not a huge dataset in terms of public company co-CEOs but the dataset that we do have as small as it is it's not great. It's just like I don't know. I'm now between this the co-CEO -- maybe ""debacle"" is too strong a word but the co-CEOs that didn't work out at Chipotle. We could name other companies as well. I don't know. You just used the phrase ""yellow flag."" It's now moved into that category for me as an investor. If I see a company in my portfolio is coming out with the news that the CEO is being joined by a co-CEO I'm now no longer looking at it as glass half full.

Flippen: It's such a fun dynamic to try to bait because you don't really know what's going on behind the scenes with co-CEOs. So it's really easy to point out well this is a structure that's never going to work in the first place because what you're doing is we're moving the single point of responsibility that exists for an organization. When you're the CEO of a company even if you're not making decisions that affect the company itself you are the responsible party for that company's performance. At any time you're dividing up responsibility among two people it can turn into a battle of well that wasn't my call; that was the co-CEO's call. You are then potentially exposing yourself to more in-fighting. Now there are some good examples of companies that have made this work. Atlassian and their two co-CEOs/two co-founders have done an incredible job of leading that company to a long track record of success.

But I do think to your point we don't have enough data. There is such a small subset of companies that have ever operated under the regime of two co-CEOs to really draw out whether or not it means good things or bad things for companies. But because we have seen so many high profile blow-ups I think it's fair to say it is a yellow flag. Whenever I see the structure coming into play what I want to see is some conversation around how they're going to divide up those responsibilities. Where do they see their circle of competencies? What decisions are they making? What conflict resolution policies do they have when those decisions come into conflict with each other? All of these things happen behind the scenes which can make it so challenging for an individual investor who doesn't have insight into how these decisions are being made to figure out is this a bad structure or is this potentially a good structure?

Hill: Shares of Salesforce are down 10% today. As you said this was a really solid quarter. Are we seeing a little bit of headline risk here that whatever drama there is surrounding the co-CEO leaving is masking what on the surface appears to be really good results?

Flippen: I will say I think this is a bit of an overreaction and I think the market's overlooking what aspect of Bret Taylor's career that is potentially also coming into play here. Taylor used to be on the board of directors for Twitter. But with the Musk transition that board has been resolved. This could be a situation. Dissolved not resolved. Hopefully to be resolved at some point in the future but dissolved for the time being which has put Taylor in a position where maybe his career is just coming to a crossroads. He has an entrepreneurial pass like you mentioned. He spent a long time working for large organizations Salesforce Facebook even leading them through their IPO as CTO. There are ways for him to potentially evolve his career. That could simply have nothing to do with the performance of Salesforce or co-leading with Marc Benioff and much more to do with his individual career.

Hill: Let's move to groceries. Kroger's third-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. The grocery chain also raised guidance for the full fiscal year. Kroger is the parent company of a number of grocery brands including Ralphs and Harris Teeter. I don't think this should surprise anyone who's actually been to a grocery store lately just the fact that a grocery store chain is doing well in these inflationary times.

Flippen: We're all feeling it in our pocketbooks. Anytime for me my weekly grocery shops have dramatically increased in price. My instinct when I see Kroger and other grocery stores doing well as a consumer is to be a little bit put out. It's great that you're doing well but what about my pocketbook? But there have been a lot of eyes on Kroger given its earlier announcement this year of their intention to acquire Albertsons combining two of the largest grocery store chains in the U.S. They think that will lower prices for consumers. There's some regulatory questions about whether or not that would actually be anticompetitive. But regardless there are a lot of eyes looking on Kroger as a result of this acquisition and they certainly met expectations in the quarter. Revenue rose more than 6% year over year. That's excluding fuel.

Their gross margins actually held steady which is extremely impressive for a grocery store chain to achieve during these inflationary periods. Their same-store sales or their comparable-store sales rose nearly 7%. As a result they raised guidance across the board including and most importantly for their store brands. I think this is where the story gets a little bit more nuanced than just saying well people are buying more groceries inflation is hard corporate greed is up. Kroger has actually put a lot of effort into developing and expanding their private-label brands. Those private labels themselves saw same-store sales growth of nearly 10%. That's just the I should say same-store sales probably a bad comparable.

But comparable growth for those brands of 10% in the quarter which is extremely impressive for a company of their size and their operating profits have actually declined minorly in part because of some of this accounting funkiness with the impact that inflation has on their inventory accounting systems. But also in part thanks to increases of expensive operation. It's not like Kroger is doing so exceptionally well in these inflationary times that they are taking a victory lap. This is still a very low-margin business. They're trying to squeeze out the margin that they can to provide value for customers by launching and pushing their private-label products which sell at lower prices in comparison to higher-value brands. This is a good business but one that is still attempting to navigate an uncertain economy the same way we are as consumers.

Hill: It is a low-margin business which is why the stat you just shared about their in-house brands and the comparable growth there is as impressive as it is. This is a business that has historically done a good job with its acquisitions with incorporating the brands that they acquire and bringing them under the Kroger umbrella. They've never attempted it with a grocery chain the size of Albertsons. How much of a challenge is that for them? I'm assuming part of the navigation they have to do is prepare for the Albertsons acquisition while also making it clear to regulators that they're doing their due diligence and that they are laying out a good case for why this acquisition should go through. Because I could see competitors making the case to regulators you shouldn't let something the size of Kroger acquire something the size of Albertsons.

Flippen: It's a fair argument to be made which does put the onus on Kroger to prove that they can lower prices as a result. Their argument is hey we're up against unprecedented competition right now. Walmart even Amazon all these e-commerce players getting into grocery and this combination will allow us to be more efficient scale larger and provide lower prices for consumers. That's their argument to regulators. But to your point Chris getting them to buy that argument challenging especially in an environment that has a lot of scrutiny from regulators but also it's probably going to be very expensive for Kroger. We've already seen some of these costs start to weigh on the business. I wouldn't be surprised to see their bottom line contract as this integration and this acquisition is swallowed by Kroger. Expect for the nonadjusted bottom line to be impacted if this acquisition does continue to move forward. But long term I do think this combination if it's allowed by regulators and if it's achieved appropriately could be wonderful in terms of just expanding Kroger's reach and hopefully improving its margin.

Hill: Emily Flippen always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.

Flippen: Thanks for having me again Chris.

Hill: Before this next segment I got to give you a heads-up on something we're going to be doing all month. If you listened to our MarketFoolery podcast back in the day you know that the man behind the glass Dan Boyd and I have a tradition in the month of December. Back in 2015 we were complaining to each other about the lack of creativity that radio stations have when they switch their format to playing all holiday music. To be clear it's not that we're anti-holiday music. We are fans of holiday music. What bothers us is that radio stations play the same 50 songs over and over. No disrespect to Mariah Carey; love that song. ""Jingle Bell Rock""? Sure. Play that once for old time's sake. But over and over? This was something that Dan and I could not abide.

So we decided to do our small part to broaden everyone's horizon of holiday music. This month Monday through Thursday from now until Christmas we're replacing our usual outro music with something that you are not going to hear on your local radio station. If you're wondering what the song is just check the show notes on your podcast app.

Now on to the next segment. Running a business means dealing with competitors and it's tough to compete with a company that is roughly 1000 times bigger than yours. But that's exactly what DigitalOcean is trying to do in the business of cloud infrastructure. With more here's Ricky Mulvey.

Ricky Mulvey: Welcome to bear-vs.-bull. We pick a company find some analysts and then flip a coin to see which side they'll take. Today the company is DigitalOcean a cloud infrastructure provider for small to medium-sized businesses. On the bull side making his bull-vs.-bear debut -- it's not bear-vs.-bull; it's definitely bull-vs.-bear -- making his bull-vs.-bear debut it is Jeff Santoro. Welcome.

Jeff Santoro: Hey Ricky. How are you doing? Happy to be here.

Mulvey: Doing well. Thanks for being here. And on the bear side returning champion Jamie Louko. Thanks for playing.

Jamie Louko: I hate to put a stifle on Jeff's debut but it's going to be a tough panel today.

Santoro: Yeah we'll see.

Mulvey: Oh there's no easy outs in bull-vs.-bear. Let's get started. Jeff Santoro five minutes for the bull side. Time is yours.

Santoro: All right. Let's say you're a small or medium-sized business or maybe even a start-up. You have as little as two employees maybe a few dozen. It's 2022. You absolutely need cloud infrastructure to compete. There's no way around it. So you have several choices. You can go to the cloud behemoths like AWS Google Cloud Microsoft Azure and you know what you're going to get. It's going to be a quality product. But the question is at what cost? You will literally be a tiny fish in a massive pond. The pricing is going to be opaque customer support might be difficult to navigate and the offerings are super complicated especially for a small business that doesn't have a team of software developers and engineers to navigate that scenario. Enter DigitalOcean. They offer transparent affordable pricing. It's easy to understand. There's 24/7 customer support no matter how big or small your business is.

There's a community of developers ready to add extra support. It's the ideal choice for start-ups and small or medium-sized businesses that have a limited staff and limited financial resources. This is the market that DigitalOcean caters to and it's done so very successfully. It's also a big market opportunity. By one estimate DigitalOcean has a total addressable market of $72 billion and that's projected to double by 2025 to $145 billion. Just to put that in perspective DigitalOcean's trailing 12-month revenue as of this past quarter was only $533 million. Even if that TAM number is wildly optimistic the market opportunity is still huge for DigitalOcean. Now what happens when these small businesses become large businesses? Well DigitalOcean is going to need to adapt and grow with its customers so it can continue to support them.

But the evidence so far is that their customers are really happy with the platform and that should really help with churn and keep customers as the company scales. To drive this point home in the last quarter DigitalOcean's net dollar retention rate was 118%. That means that customers now are spending 18% more than they did a year ago. Importantly this number includes churn so that's customers that have left. This number was also 107% when the company first came on the public markets back in Q1 of 2021. It's grown pretty strong over the time that they've been publicly traded. What's even more impressive about that churn number and about the net dollar retention rate is that a lot of small businesses go out of business. Some of that churn isn't companies leaving because they're not happy with DigitalOcean; it's because they simply went out of business. So that makes the churn number and the retention rate number even more impressive.

Let's take a look at DigitalOcean's most recent quarter which was Q3 of 2022 reported recently. I want to compare a couple of important metrics to that first publicly reported quarter Q1 of '21. Year over year revenue growth has never been below 29%. Gross margin has expanded from 58% to 65%. On the bottom line the company has gone from a net loss of $3 million in that first reported quarter to net income of $10 million in most recent quarter. Free cash flow has been positive in every quarter except the first one when they were on the public market.

Lastly one thing that I like to look at when I evaluate businesses is their operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. In Q3 of 2022 their operating expenses were 58% of revenue and in the year-ago quarter that number was 62%. We've seen that improve over the past couple of months. Now what about moving forward? Well Q4 management is expecting $161 million of revenue at the midpoint.

That would be a year-over-year increase of 34% and would continue that revenue growth streak that I mentioned earlier. For the full year revenue target is $574 million at the midpoint and that's actually raised from where the guidance was in Q2. It would mean full-year revenue growth of 32% compared to 2021. Lastly free cash flow margin was 15% and management is expecting that to grow to 20% by 2024.

The last thing I want to talk about is valuation. Despite all these strong results DigitalOcean trades for around 5.5 times trailing sales and 70 times free cash flow and both of those metrics are just about at their all-time low. You can buy shares of DigitalOcean right now for almost as cheap as it's ever been.

Just to sum it up DigitalOcean has carved this niche within a market opportunity that has massive secular tailwinds. If it continues to please its customers and can grow with them while continuing to take share of the growing SMB market this will be a winning investment for years to come.

Mulvey: Jeff Santoro thank you for the bull case. Yeah competing with Microsoft Amazon Google that sounds difficult. Taking the bear side Jamie Louko five minutes is yours.

Louko: Thanks Ricky. As much as I love DigitalOcean I have a few problems with the company. The first is that it's facing some huge competitors. DigitalOcean is up against rivals like Amazon Web Services Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure in this space. While DigitalOcean is the only platform that has major SMB offerings this could definitely change. Amazon has about $35 billion in cash. Microsoft has $63 billion in cash and is generating $23 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. Google is generating $22 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow and has about $62.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Comparatively DigitalOcean has just $825 million in cash and marketable securities and about $41 million in trailing 12-month free cash flow. While Amazon Microsoft and Google don't have leading SMB cloud solutions yet that could change and all three companies have more than enough money to build market-leading products if DigitalOcean continues to gain steam and these companies want a piece of that pie.

But why haven't these large rivals done it yet? Potentially these three big players don't have established solutions because there hasn't been consistent demand for it yet. Now that Amazon Google and Microsoft see that there is established demand for these SMB cloud solutions these three competitors could just funnel money into this niche offering quite easily. DigitalOcean came in and picked this low-hanging fruit at the beginning but they basically had no competition thus far. As rivals pick up the pace in this niche offering the company's growth could slow. The company isn't seeing this yet as DigitalOcean is expecting about 34% 2022 revenue growth but that's because these rivals haven't started investing in this SMB space yet. That is my first risk. The other risks with DigitalOcean is its balance sheet.

Typically cloud companies have a strong balance sheet with little debt and lots of cash but that's not the case with DigitalOcean. They have cash and marketable securities of about $825 million but long-term debt of $1.5 billion. This brings up two main concerns. The first is that this large debt pile potentially indicates that DigitalOcean has been fueling its growth with debt. Once the company can't take on any more debt growth could slow dramatically. The second is that in an environment with high interest rates the company can afford to take on additional debt to continue to fuel this top line growth. With this lopsided balance sheet the company will be forced to pay off this debt instead of using its cash to invest to keep its leadership role in this space. That's already going to be hard to do considering that rivals are likely going to come into this space in the future but this factor makes it especially hard.

DigitalOcean has been a success story so far. There's no doubt about that. But the company's future looks a lot more uncertain than it ever has. With rivals putting lots of money and potentially out-investing DigitalOcean in this space over the coming years the company has previously been operating in a market with relatively low competition and it's likely been relying on debt to fuel this growth. All of these factors could be major headwinds to the company's adoption and market share growth over the next five years. Therefore I'm not expecting the same success over the past five years for the next five for DigitalOcean and prospective investors shouldn't either. This could make it hard for DigitalOcean to live up to its valuation of 72 times free cash flow. Yes while that might be an all-time low it's still exorbitant for a company with this many headwinds on the horizon. With rising competition an upside-down balance sheet and a valuation that could potentially be really hard to live up to over the next five years DigitalOcean is in a really uncertain spot and I'm pretty concerned about the company's long-term future.

2022 has been a big year for value stocks many of which are beating the market. Growth investing took a backseat to safer approaches after years of wealth creation while the economy became volatile. But 2023 is on the horizon and the market could change very quickly.

As many sky-high valuations on growth stocks bottom out these stocks could really start up again in the new year. A responsible approach to growth investing which takes valuation into account along with growth prospects could help you achieve your investing goals this year.

It's unlikely for any stock to gain five times its value in one year sustainably but there are those rare stocks out there that appear to be strongly undervalued or have such massive potential that they could really skyrocket. Global-e online (GLBE -1.30%) Revolve Group (RVLV -1.48%) and Portillo's (PTLO 0.60%) are my recommendations for growth stocks that could explode in 2023.

1. The best e-commerce stock you never heard of

Global-e provides cross-border e-commerce solutions for direct-to-consumer retailers. As a customer you wouldn't interact with the company directly but you might use some of its services integrated into a client website.

It has an impressive list of partner clients that continues to grow including names such as Disney LVMH and Hugo Boss. Plus with its recent acquisition of Borderfree it now has even more marquee clients like Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom.

The company's services add a compelling dimension to a direct-to-consumer growth strategy. It cites many customer success stories: The Native Shoe Company's international conversion rates increased by 87% in one year when it partnered with Global-e and luggage brand Doughnut increased international orders by 210% in one year.

It's not surprising that so many companies are signing on even in the challenging economy. Actually that might even be more of a reason since retailers facing slowing or declining sales are looking for new ways to invigorate sales rates.

That's why even in the third quarter it demonstrated robust growth.

Sales increased 79% over last year to $621 million. Gross profit increased 92% over last year and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) improved from $7.7 million to $12.5 million. Net loss however widened from $28.5 million to $64.6 million.

A big part of that continued to be the amortization of warrants related to Shopify's investment in Global-e and as that amortizes and the company continues to scale profitability should improve.

Global-e stock is down 69% in 2022 and still trades at almost nine times trailing-12-month sales so it's not cheap. But the potential here is enormous and as sales increase and profitability improves this stock could be a standout.

2. The intersection of fashion and technology

Revolve Group is a fashion company that uses artificial intelligence technology and social media to sell clothing and related products. It boasts 70000 apparel items and it plans to branch out into beauty shoes and accessories expanding its fashion empire.

Millennial and Gen-Z fans are hooked. They continue to buy and increase order value despite inflation so even though Revolve's growth is decelerating in this environment it's well positioned to maintain its momentum and return to higher growth in better times.

This is a founder-led company and its co-CEOs are highly focused on operational excellence and differentiation. They went for a new concept when they created Revolve almost 20 years ago and traditional fashion retailers are now trying to catch up.

Revolve's sales increased 10% year over year in the third quarter and net income decreased by 28%. Revolve's high-fashion site FWRD targets a more affluent customer and continues to outperform the rest of the company posting a 17% sales increase. And the company generated $9 million in free cash flow a triple-digit increase over last year.

Because the company is completely online it doesn't have to pay for costly store space or hold tons of inventory.

It was able to rebalance inventory levels when demand began to decrease in the second quarter and other companies were left with overflow. That's allowed it to stay profitable and cash-flow positive despite slowing demand. And since it relies on artificial intelligence for critical and current data it was able to do that while still offering customers the merchandise they were looking for keeping the sales flow steady. These are qualities that make it a retail superstar.

Revolve stock is down 55% this year and trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24. It's cheap and it has tons of potential in 2023 and beyond.

3. Getting a better burger

Portillo's is a small fast-casual burger chain that says it offers ""unrivaled Chicago street food."" It's been around as an iconic Chicago emblem since 1963 but it opened its first store outside of Illinois in 2005 with plans for real expansion in 2015. It went public last year and its stock has been down 49% since then.

The restaurant chain now operates 71 stores which is tiny compared to chains that offer similar fare like Chipotle Mexican Grill (almost 3100) and Shake Shack (402).

It's demonstrating robust growth with a 10% year-over-year sales increase in the third quarter including a 6% comparable sales increase. Even better it's profitable although net income decreased from $6.5 million last year to $3.2 million this year. Profitability is likely to be variable as the company scales but posting positive net income at this stage is a great signal of healthy growth.

Out of the stocks on this list Portillo's seems to have the most unknowns since it's so new and so small making it somewhat risky. But it's quite cheap trading at 1.5 times trailing-12-month sales and it has serious potential to expand.

Considering its valuation size and popularity Portillo's looks like it could be a huge asset to a growth-oriented portfolio in 2023 and for many years.",,,

Construction is nearing completion on the St. Charbel Maronite Church in Doha Qatar with plans to open its doors to worshippers in 2025 coinciding with the Catholic Church’s Jubilee Year according to Father Charbel Mhanna from Qatar’s Maronite parish.

In an interview with ACI Mena CNA’s Arabic-language news partner Mhanna explained that with a capacity of about 3000 people St. Charbel will be the country’s largest church open to all Catholics. Once completed it will be Qatar’s second Catholic church joining the existing Church of Our Lady of the Rosary.

While precise statistics on the Christian population in Qatar are lacking Mhanna estimates there are close to 1 million Christians there of which about 70% are Catholic. Approximately 12000 belong to the Maronite rite which is in full communion with the pope.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbnBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWF0dC1jaGFuZGxlci1yZWZsZWN0cy1vbi1ncmFjZS1oZS1yZWNlaXZlZC1hZnRlci1jb250cm92ZXJzeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matt Chandler reflects on 'grace and accountability' he experienced from church after controversy,"Home News Matt Chandler reflects on 'grace and accountability' he experienced from church after controversy

Matt Chandler has opened up about what he learned about grace and accountability after being restored to the pulpit following a tumultuous period in 2022 in which he took a leave of absence from teaching and preaching at The Village Church in Flower Mound Texas.

In August 2022 Chandler announced to The Village Church congregation which he has led since 2002 that he had an inappropriate online relationship with a woman and would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from preaching and teaching.

Though the relationship was not sexual or romantic Chandler said church elders deemed the messages exchanged over Instagram ""unguarded and unwise"" and ""revealed something unhealthy in me.""

""We cannot be a church where anyone is above the scriptures and above the high heavenly call into Christ Jesus"" Chandler said adding he agreed with the elder's assessment. ""The Word of God holds me to a certain standard. And I fell short.""

He was restored to the pulpit a little over three months later following a ""profound time of healing.""

In an interview with The Christian Post the 49-year-old husband and father-of-three reflected on that time and said that when he ""stumbled"" he was instantly met with grace and accountability from those around him.

""The thing about [2022] in particular was that the kind of culture we had tried to build here — one of accountability and a higher standard for a person in public ministry — held strong"" Chandler explained. ""When I stumbled I was met with both grace and accountability.""

For Chandler — who has made messages on God's grace a hallmark of his ministry — the experience solidified the notion that grace is not an abstract concept but a tangible force that exists alongside the weight of accountability.

He credited his church's transparent handling of the controversy with allowing his congregation to witness the reality of both concepts in action; they saw firsthand he said that while grace offers forgiveness there is often a price for missteps.

In the aftermath Chandler observed that the church community became more willing to confess their struggles taking proactive steps to address what he described as ""little lions"" or small issues that could grow into significant problems if left unchecked.

""What that produced in our congregation is another visible picture that that grace is real and that there is still at times a payment for stumbling that is costly in other areas"" he said.

""We have seen since people are more apt to confess more quickly … we have seen a tremendous amount of trust in the processes we have in place to deal with those kinds of things in the lives of people. And so that's been the fruit of that.""

Reflecting on the unique pressures of pastoral ministry Chandler who also serves as executive director of the church-planting network Acts 29 spoke candidly about the loneliness and mental health challenges often faced by spiritual leaders.

Chandler previously served as president of Acts 29 replacing Mark Driscoll who was later disqualified from leadership due to ""ungodly and disqualifying behavior.""

""I think I'm an outlier on this but I've never bought into that a pastor can't be close friends with the guys that he does ministry with"" he said.

Though acknowledging that stories of betrayal and sabotage from within the Church aren't uncommon Chandler said that throughout his ministry he's chosen to cultivate meaningful relationships with those around him.

""I've been involved at the highest level with church planning stuff the number of stories of men being betrayed and sabotaged by other people in the church or other staff members in the church is a very real thing. I'm just not built personality wise to want to do this by myself.""

At The Village Church — a Southern Baptist congregation — Chandler is one of three lead pastors. While his influence might be more visible due to his pulpit presence he emphasized that he has no greater vote in decision-making.

""I have done life deeply with a group of five guys that are on staff with me"" he said. ""Two of those relationships are over 15 years going now and the other ones are right at a decade. I have chosen to not give in to the 'I'm going to carry this thing by myself.' I'm going to invite guys into my life.""

For Chandler this network of trust has been critical particularly when it comes to the ups and downs of the ministry.

""I would encourage guys as best they can to create a strong circle of trust where they don't have to be the hero but can be human. And I say that because they are human"" he advised.

The pastor recently released his first book since returning to the pulpit The Overcomers highlighting how Revelation can help Christians find their ""identity and purpose in God's plan."" He cautioned against creating a culture where pastors are seen as infallible.

""If you create a world where you're the Messiah where you have all the answers you're making an already difficult situation impossible"" he stressed. ""I would encourage any pastor … to begin to create slowly but surely a circle of trust for him that's deeply honest and vulnerable for the good of his own soul.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTM0MDIwNTkvTmVpZ2hib3Vycy13YXItY2h1cmNoLXdpbmRvdy1sb29rcy1yaWdodC1iZWRyb29tLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEzNDAyMDU5L2FtcC9OZWlnaGJvdXJzLXdhci1jaHVyY2gtd2luZG93LWxvb2tzLXJpZ2h0LWJlZHJvb20uaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pain in the glass! Neighbours at war after couple builds 10ft 'church' window that looks right into bedroom of,"Neighbours in a quaint market town are at war after a couple built a 10ft 'church-style' window that looks right into the bedroom of the family next door.

Mark Waddilove 62 and his partner Helen Fitt 49 received few complaints after they applied for planning permission for the huge widow on the first floor of their home in Wimbourne Dorset

But once the window was put in for the calming room - where Miss Fitt planned to do her yoga - the complaints from neighbours - who dubbed it a 'monstrosity' - soon arrived with many upset the new installation allowed the couple to see into their properties.

Rob Langdown a church celebrant and his wife Margaret said the new window looks right into their bedroom - and that they were blindsided by the development accusing officials of failing to put up planning notices in their road ahead of granting it permission.

The married couple added that they would have objected to the development on the grounds of it breaching their privacy and being out of touch with the area if they were aware of it.

Wimbourne residents Tim and Deborah James who live next door complained that as well as overlooking their property the development has blocked out sunlight into their back garden.

Mark Waddilove and Helen Fitt (pictured) didn't receive many complaints after they launched planning permission for the window

Neighbours dubbed the giant window a 'monstrosity'

The James' also say Mr Waddilove and Miss Fitt have sent them legal letters about giving access to their property while the work is carried out.

Both sets of homeowners have branded the extension a 'monstrosity' and fear it has reduced the value of their properties. They also slammed Dorset Council for allowing it to go ahead.

The local authority said it stands by its decision to grant planning consent for the extension to the back of the semi-detached house in the pretty market town of Wimborne Minster.

It is the second similar case where council planners have faced criticism over a controversial development that overlooks neighbouring homes in recent months.

In nearby Corfe Mullen Terry Selby has taken his case to the Local Government Ombudsman.

He and wife Margaret were shocked when permission was granted to replace their nextdoor neighbours' bungalow with a two-storey building that now towers over their home.

Mr Selby believes Dorset Council made a 'massive mistake' and partly blames the work from home culture for a lack of cohesion that led to the decision.

In Colehill Mr Langdown also believes the council has made a mistake. He said: 'We were not informed of this planning application.

'A notice went up in our cul-de-sac but not in the private lane where the three bungalows most directly affected by this extension are.

'They could have posted us a letter there are only three houses. But we didn't see the notice and didn't have the chance to object and the next thing we have this bloody great big window looking straight at us.

'It looks like a church window that is twice the size of the one that was there and is now much further forward. It looks straight into our property. It is a monstrosity and not in keeping with the area at all.

Picture shows an aerial view of the window which neighbours said they would have complained about had they known about the planning application

A next door neighbour complained that the extension blocks light from reaching his property

'It is quite concerning to think that this has been passed without anybody being approached about it. It is going to devalue our property.'

The Colehill Parish Council did not object to the proposals but did express concern that local residents were not aware of them due to the lack of notices.

Next door neighbour Tim James 63 said: 'I'm not happy about it it blocks our light out and the extension overlooks us we have no privacy in our garden.

'It's been an absolute nightmare from the start. We've had six months of continual hammering and drilling from eight in the morning since October and it's making it a nightmare to live here.

'They were sending us letters about the agreement which were quite threatening saying you must sign this within X number of days.

'They said we had to let a surveyor who worked for them into our property otherwise if there were any cracks in our building we wouldn't be able to claim anything.

'I'm not worried by their threats but it doesn't make it a nice place to live.

'We have appealed against it the whole way through but nobody has taken a blind but of notice. The council doesn't care.

'Living in a semi-detached house with all that going on every day is just ridiculous.'

Mr Waddilove and Ms Fitt declined to comment on the matter.

Mr Waddilove is company director of an IT solutions business and according to Linkedin works as a senior programme manager at Solent University in Southampton.

A spokesperson for Dorset Council said: 'The application was advertised by means of site notices erected by the case officer on September 8 2022.

'This included a lamppost notice on Farriers Close near to the entrance of the road. There was no suitable street furniture on which to erect a site notice closer to the properties in question.

Picture shows the 'church-style' window is clearly visible from the road

In nearby Corfe Mullen Terry Selby has taken his case to the Local Government Ombudsman in a similar case

'The case officer visited the site and judged that the proposed new window would not overlook the complainants' property any more than their previous window.

'We stand by our decision but the neighbour is free to make a formal complaint as we haven't had any other complaints about this development to date. House values are not a material consideration when assessing planning applications.'

The spokesperson denied that working from home had any impact on the council's decision making.'

They said: 'Flexible working from home arrangements in recent years have had no negative impact on our planning processes including this application.

'Modern networking technology means officers can access the same information and tools at home as in the office. They work in the same capacity and to the same requirements as before and still carry out site visits when needed and other due diligence regardless of where their desk-based work takes place.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvdXMvbW9ybW9uLWNodXJjaC1sYXR0ZXItZGF5LXNhaW50cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Modern Mormon Missionaries: Facebook Evangelizing Women in Pants,"Andres Gonzalez 19 stands on the balcony of his Los Angeles apartment his hands in his suit pockets.

Film ini menampilkan kisah percintaan anak muda Jakarta dengan latar Indonesia di 100 tahun kemerdekaannya.

Diproduksi Max Pictures 2045 Apa Ada Cinta disutradarai Indra Gunawan dengan tiga aktor muda di jajaran pemeran utama. Mereka adalah Yasmin Napper Cinta Brian dan Indah Kusuma.

Selain tiga nama aktor di atas film ini juga dibintangi Nino Fernandez Roy Marthen Ferry Salim Ira Maya Sopha Jui Prawoto dan Indra Aksa.

Bergenre romance 2045 Apa Ada Cinta mengangkat tema cinta segitiga di antara tiga karakter utama dengan persahabatan dan percintaan anak muda yang rumit sebagai garis besar cerita.

Kisa cinta segitiga dimulai ketika Maera (Indah Kusuma) mendapat tugas dari kampus dan bertemu dengan seorang pengusaha muda pendiri perusahaan Go Green Marshal (Cinta Brian). Meski pertemuan mereka terbilang singkat Marshal memberi kesan yang baik kepada Maera sehingga membuat Maera jatuh cinta.

Maera yang introvert pun mulai untuk mencari tahu lebih jauh mengenai Marshal lewat bantuan temannya yang merupakan seorang hacker Renata (Yasmin Napper). Melihat Maera bersikap tidak seperti biasanya membuat Renata ragu untuk membantu sahabatnya itu tetapi pada akhirnya Renata bersedia untuk membantu Meara.

Namun pertemuan Renata dan Marshal menjadi sesuatu yang tidak diharapkan oleh Maera. Marshal tertarik dengan kepintaran Renata dan berniat merekrutnya untuk bekerja di Go Green. Perlahan Renata pun mulai menyukai Marshal.

Menyukai pria yang sama pertemanan Renata dan Maera pun menjadi dingin dan semakin rumit. Seiring berjalannya waktu Maera dan Renata akhirnya saling mengerti dan keduanya semakin membaik. Marshal pun masuk ke dalam kehidupan mereka untuk menjadi seorang teman sekaligus sahabat.

Kisah cinta segitiga dari tiga karakter utama yang ditampilkan 2045 Apa Ada Cinta memang nampak serupa dengan banyak kisah cinta segitiga yang sudah ditampilkan dalam banyak karya film sebelumnya. Satu hal yang membuat film ini berbeda dari film romance Indonesia lainnya adalah keberadaan teknologi dalam cerita yang ditampilkan.

Dengan latar Indonesia di 2045 teknologi yang ditampilkan tentunya jauh lebih berkembang dibandingkan teknologi saat ini. Selain dapat melihat gambaran dari mimpi-mimpi Indonesia ke depan lewat film ini kita juga dapat melihat ketika sisi emosional manusia berhadapan dengan teknologi.

Seperti apa yang ditampilkan dalam trailer setiap karakter memiliki sosok pendampingnya masing-masing yang dihasilkan dari teknologi Artificial Intelligence (AI). Dalam hal ini dapat dilihat bahwa teknologi sangat berpengaruh terhadap berbagai segi kehidupan manusia tidak terkecuali dengan hal-hal yang menyangkut persahabatan dan percintaan.

Quarterback Rodey Hooper threw two scoring passes and running back Austin Cumpton scored three touchdowns on offense.

Special teams set up one score and provided another on Will Scott's kickoff return.

And the defense tossed a shutout until a late Loboes touchdown against mostly reserves.

The result was not the tug-o-war that fans expected but a 40-7 win by the state's No. 2 team to secure a second straight Region I-2A Division I championship.

""When you play us you've got to pick and choose"" Cumpton said. ""That's what makes us such a good football team. But that was a dang good football team over there. We have great respect for those guys.""

Hawley coach Mitch Ables saw his team play a dang good game.

""I can't express how proud I am of our kids and how they played"" Ables said. ""We knew it was going to be a war.

“One day at a time the whole week working on every phase and they came out and stayed with the game plan as good as we have all year.""

The emphatic win sends Hawley (14-0) into the Class 2A Division I semifinals against Crawford which edged Tolar 14-7 in a defensive battle. The game will be played at 7 p.m. Thursday in Mineral Wells.

Cisco ended its season at 11-3 losing twice to Hawley.

""They're obviously back healthy and playing really good postseason football"" Cisco coach Kevin Stennett said. ""They got after us. Hat's off to them and their coaching staff.

""We wish them the best of luck. That's a well-rounded football team and I expect them to play another couple of weeks.""

Ables a week earlier lamented his team's slow starts against Panhandle and Sonora. The Bearcats on Friday started fast scoring on their first two possessions for a 14-0 first-quarter lead.

The Bearcats needed six plays to go 63 yards for their first score and five plays to score again with Scott diving into the end zone after taking a pass from Hooper from 7 yards out.

""It was something we were preaching all week. After playing for 14 weeks were were getting a little lax but we talked about starting fast and they did a great job tonight."" Ables said.

After making it 20-0 Hawley's Chandlin Myers pounced on a fumbled pooch kickoff setting up his team at the Cisco 36-yard line. One play later he caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from Hooper.

If 28-0 at halftime wasn't a mountain to climb for Cisco Hawley ended any comeback hopes when Scott took the second-half kickoff found a seam and worked through his blocking for a 73-yard return.

""We always talk about scoring on the first drive of the first half and the first drive of the second half' Ables said.

The kickoff return was a killer for Cisco. Before the Loboes could run an offensive play they were down 34-0.

""That third phase of the game this late in the playoffs that's just as important as anything"" Stennett said.

Cumpton who was injured and did not play when Hawley edged Cisco 17-14 a year ago in the region final finished with 125 yards rushing.

""I had a rough season last year but we went all the way"" Cumpton said of getting on the field for this year's game. ""Nothing feels better than playing with my boys. All of us are healthy and keeping it rolling.""

Hooper who threw for 163 yards in the first half completed his only pass attempt of the second half for 21 yards.

Cisco's offense basically was quarterback Hunter Long.

He ran 36 times for 223 yards. In the fourth quarter the senior ran all eight times on a 70-yard scoring drive. When Cisco got the ball back he ran six more times 75 yards. The game ended with his run to the Hawley 9.

""He never gives up"" Stennett said of Long. ""He never will in anything he does in life. We're going to miss him.""

The Loboes were close to the Hawley end zone a couple of more times in the game.

In the first half Tre Brackeen intercepted Hooper near midfield with his team down 14-0. Cisco got to the Bearcats' 29 but Long was hit while throwing in a crowed pocket and Cumpton intercepted at the 26 returning the pick to the 48.

And down 34-0 after the second-half kickoff return Cisco marched from its 29 to Hawley 33. But a 15-yard penalty and losses on three carries by Long forced a punt.

After both of those missed opportunities Hawley cashed in with a touchdown.

Breaking it down

∎ Turning point: After scoring to make it 20-0 Hawley pooched the kickoff. Cisco didn't score the ball and Chandlin Myers came up with it at the Loboes' 36. After a play lost a yard Myers caught a 37-yard touchdown pass. In the span of 47 seconds a two-score game went to 28-0 in favor the Bearcats. Cisco could not recover.

∎ Players of the game: Hunter Long Cisco High quarterback– The senior shouldered his team rushing for all but 5 yards of Cisco's total and added 59 yards passing. Austin Cumpton Hawley High running back. It's hard to single out one player for the Bearcats but Cumpton contributed nothing to Hawley's 2021 Region I championship over Cisco. He sat out the the game with a season-ending injury. This time he rushed for 125 yards and three touchdowns while intercepting a pass on defense.

∎ Key stats: No. 1 Hawley scored on four of its five first-half possessions for a 28-0 halftime lead. No. 2 Long carried the final seven plays of Cisco's opening drive of the second half all eight plays of his team's only scoring drive and the final six plays of the game. That's 21 straight runs by the senior quarterback who finished with 36 carries in the game.

∎ Coach Stennett said: “They obviously played well at the beginning of the game. Some good things happened for them and they fed off of that. We tried to claw our way back in but just couldn't do it. You're going to run into a team that's better than you at some point and they were tonight.""

∎ Coach Ables said: “I think our kids were ready to play. The first time we played we were missing a couple of guys and I think that made us drop our head a little bit. But our kids have been resilient all year. We're getting healthy at a good time too. That's a big part of it when you get your playmakers back in the lineup that really helps out."" Ables was pleased with his offensive and defensive lines. ""They're getting good at the right time. (Cisco) is a good tough physical team up front. To be able to play like we did tonight that's a testament to our kids.""

∎ Impact: Hawley advances in the Class 2A Division I semifinals while Cisco ends its season again at the hands of the Bearcats.

∎ Up next: Hawley plays Crawford which edged previously unbeaten Tolar 14-7 in a state semifinal at 7 p.m. Thursday in Mineral Wells.

Cisco 22 was limited in practice this week with a shoulder injury and is expected to be replaced in the starting lineup by veteran safety Dewey Wingard. Through 11 games this season Cisco has a team-leading three interceptions and has emerged as an enforcer on the back end of the Jaguars defense.

While the loss of Cisco could prove costly the good news for the Jaguars is that the offense will have running back Travis Etienne Jr. and wide receiver Zay Jones — both of whom were ruled as questionable — in action Sunday.

That means they are being paid around the same as a Starbucks manager before bonuses.

In 2021 Goldman's junior bankers protested similarly long work hours calling it ""workplace abuse.""

Junior bankers at Goldman Sachs are working an average of 98 hours a week — 18 hours more than their peers according to a new survey.

This means first-year bankers at the firm are making about $22 an hour around the same as a manager at Starbucks according to calculations by Insider's Emmalyse Brownstein. This number does not include bonuses and assumes junior bankers are taking two weeks of vacation.

While end-of-year bonuses can be a large chunk of Wall Street pay they are slated to dwindle this year due to a decline in IPOs and M&A. Bonus pools which hit record levels last year are on track to be slashed by about 30% at banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup Bloomberg reported.

A spokesperson from Goldman Sachs told Brownstein that the ""data does not match ours"" in response to an email sharing the findings of the survey. The spokesperson also declined to share the firm's own findings about how many hours its junior bankers are clocking a week.

At an average of 98 hours a week Goldman's junior bankers are working 18 hours more than their fellow junior bankers who reported working an average of 80 hours per week the survey found. Junior bankers at the runner up to Goldman averaged about 86 hours a week.

Over 2500 first-year investment bankers from around 50 US firms were asked their pay what they like and don't like about their job and their perks in a survey by Odyssey Search Partners. The results from the survey are shared with private equity firms and clients who want to recruit talent from banks.

In 2021 Goldman was thrown into turmoil after an internal survey by first-year analysts at the firm was leaked to the press showing junior bankers had reached a breaking point.

Junior bankers responded they were working 98 hours a week only getting 5 hours of sleep and went to bed around 3 a.m. All of them said work hours negatively affected their relationships and almost 80% of respondents said they felt like a victim of workplace abuse.

""We recognize that our people are very busy because business is strong and volumes are at historic levels"" a Goldman spokesperson told Insider at the time. ""A year into COVID people are understandably quite stretched and that's why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them.""

This inflicts 'financial death' on people by depriving them of access to their own savings. KYC documents are basic identification documents such as your PAN number or Aadhaar or some address proof to prove that your account is bona fide. However banks simply do not pay any heed to directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and ignore whether the customer is a senior citizen an old customer or a company or even a non-government organisation (NGO) or trust.

Even many senior citizens who have been banking with the same branch for decades are being repeatedly harassed for re-KYC. Some of them are pensioners and submit their life certificates once a year to the bank. However these pensioners are also not spared by banks from the re-KYC.

While the maximum harassment is for business accounts and trusts individuals with savings accounts which need KYC renewal only once in a decade are also routinely harassed. Most are unaware that RBI has now permitted online KRC renewal. Instead customers are being asked to come to the 'home' branch in person and sometimes wait for a long time to update KYC.

Online KYC

The central bank however thinks that banks have resolved the KYC and KYC renewal issue. A high-level source at the RBI says: ""We have simplified the re-KYC process and low-risk customers are required to do re-KYC once in 10 years. This can be done through self-declaration in case there are no changes in KYC details. This can be done through digital channels such as customer's email ID mobile ATMs online banking or internet banking and mobile application of the bank concerned.""

""In case of a change only in the address details of the individual customer a self-declaration of the new address has also been allowed which has to be verified by the bank through positive confirmation within two months"" the source says.

Very few customers are aware of this change and banks who relentlessly spam their customers for loans and credit cards do not bother to provide this information either. RBI itself has funds under the depositor education and awareness fund (DEAF)—comprising of unclaimed deposits and interest—which can be used to create public awareness. The Fund even uses superstar Amitabh Bachchan in its public service campaigns. The central bank has apparently not realised that online KYC could also do with an awareness campaign.

BI in April this year as a first step in this long battle to mitigate hardships faced by bank customers. Disaggregated customers are unable to get their voices heard so our sister entity Moneylife Foundation had submitted a detailed memorandum to R in April this year as a first step in this long battle to mitigate hardships faced by bank customers.

As pointed out in the memorandum denying customers access to their own money is an extreme punishment which is imposed with impunity by bank officers often without adequate notice merely for a delay in compliance with KYC re-submission.

Read: Let's Stop This Indiscriminate Freezing of Bank Accounts ) ""Often customers get no warning and learn of the draconian action when their cheques bounce or debit card is dishonoured despite money in the bank. Sometimes they suffer because banks have made horrible mistakes or failed to seek or update information in the core banking system. Banks neither apologise nor face any consequences when this happens"" the memorandum says. (

Last year we also found that the regulator had not penalised any lender for failing to adhere to its KYC updating guidelines. Further RBI had no information about communication between banks and the regulator for KYC updates of customers in the high-risk medium-risk and low-risk categories as shown by a reply received under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

According to a top banker banks are supposed to classify customers on the basis of their risk profile and the KYC harassment is reserved for those who are seen at higher risk.

However the nature of complaints that one sees on social media reveals that depositors who would logically have the lowest risk profile—for instance senior citizens living on savings and pensions current accounts of companies that are used for routine business and salary payments—also suffer harassment and threats to freeze accounts.

Read: Bank KYC Menace: No Penalty on Banks for Failing in KYC Updating Says RBI ) Neither banks nor RBI are willing to clarify the basis of risk classification. Although banks claim that they are harassed by RBI and the regulator blames the finance ministry's money laundering regulations for this victims of such coercive action have no answers or redress. (

The updated master direction issued by RBI on KYC mandates periodic updating to be carried out at least once every two years for high-risk customers once in every eight years for medium-risk customers and once in every 10 years for low-risk customers. In the case of low-risk customers when there is no change in status with respect to their identities and addresses a self-certification to that effect shall be obtained.

Risk categorisation is undertaken based on parameters such as customer's identity social and financial status nature of business activity and information about the clients' business and their location.

However banks continue to follow their own rules while asking for re-KYC from existing customers and then taking action as per the whims and fancies of its officials. Responding to a tweet by Sucheta Dalal managing editor of Moneylife several bank customers shared their sad experiences with re-KYC. Here are a few of them...

Unfortunate. This has been happening with @AxisBank also and they have been foolishly giving stereo type explanations even after clarifying things clearly and giving required documents for re-KYC — CA Sunilkumar A B (@sunilkumar_ab) November 29 2022

The worse challenge for them is to get their KYC documents notarised and unlike India they must get an appointment from Notary's office which may take 2 to 3 weeks (4 weeks in UK) (2/2). — Rakesh (@Mumbaiyyaa) November 29 2022

I have interviewed hundreds of bank officers. They told me they have neither any time nor inclination to read RBI circulars. They follow only those directions which flow down from their own Head Offices through CBS. And HO more concerned abt their business targets than RBI circ. — Tapan Kumar Pradhan ????

When Nelly switched to the TSI1 in February of last year – just a couple weeks after officially becoming a Titleist ambassador earlier in the month – she won the Gainbridge LPGA at Boca Rio.

She then won the 2021 KPMG Women’s PGA Championship – as part of a triumphant season on the LPGA Tour that also included winning the Olympic gold medal – using the Titleist TSI1 driver.

Nelly switched to Titleist’s brand new TSR1 driver just prior to this year’s Pelican Women’s Championship and she won.

According to J.J. Van Wezenbeeck Director of Player Promotions for Titleist the company moved mountains in order to get Korda the new TSR1 in her bag as soon as they could after a fitting session showed the world No.1 gaining a bunch of distance and ball speed.

“We saw this opportunity… we knew we had this product that would help her and provide her ball speed so I have to go to the R&D team because I can’t not give Nelly product that we think will help her play better” said Van Wezenbeeck.

The new TSR1 line of metalwoods from Titleist is set to be released in the early part of the new year. Titleist Van Wezenbeeck said moved up the USGA approval process in order to make sure Korda was able to play it when she did. The initial plan he explained was to get the TSR1 line onto the USGA’s conforming list in December for a 2023 release. That was accelerated he said and with a smile said the left-handed versions of the driver didn’t even go on the list until Nov. 21.

“She wins and we were like ‘how we do we get more’ because I only had a couple to give to Nelly and the phone started ringing and everyone else wants to try it” said Van Wezenbeeck with a laugh.

Van Wezenbeeck said as Korda was coming back from injury – she was off the course for a few months earlier in the year as she recovered from a blood clot in her arm and corresponding surgery – she was trying to ramp up her speed gains. Her launch conditions weren’t perfect anymore either.

“As good as we think (her swing) looks she is in the details of how to make it better so as that changes we saw an opportunity to improve spin and launch and in that we were able to find some ball speed too” said Van Wezenbeeck.

“She’s adding real distance back into her bag (after her injury) which allows her a big competitive advantage.”

The Pelican Women’s Championship was Korda’s first event with the TSR1 driver (and fairway wood) in the bag and she led the field in Total Driving (distance plus accuracy) on the week. Korda averaged 272 yards off the tee for the season making her one of the Tour’s longest already. She said she was gaining 5-10 yards per pop her first week with the TSR1 giving her a ton of momentum off the tee heading into the 2023 campaign.

And not only is Korda playing well but she’s going to be looking good as well as J. Lindeberg launched its first collaboration with Korda during the week of the LPGA Tour’s season finale. Korda and the Swedish clothing giant have been partners for two years and this new collection features 17 pieces of lifestyle apparel.

“The collection is inspired by the woman Nelly Korda not just the golfer” said J.Lindeberg Head of Design Neil Lewty a release. “The clothes are made to be worn and enjoyed both on and off the course.”

Korda rocked a few of the pieces herself during the CME Group Tour Championship. She said with a laugh that ‘Nelly Korda’ is indeed hidden throughout the pieces and she picked the green and blue colours because with a laugh she said that’s what golfers like.

“I got a really cool opportunity with J.Lindeberg to drop a capsule. We worked on a couple of pieces a few shirts few dresses some hoodies sweats joggers. And it was really cool to kind of see the other side of that and I’m super grateful that they even just gave me the opportunity” said Korda. “It’s cool to kind of give my little touch to a clothing line.

“It kind of plays off my life too. Obviously I play golf. I work out. All of that is kind of in that line but it’s also fun and there’s also some chill clothing in there… it just kind of all represents me.”

So whether it’s rocking her own clothing or swinging a new driver – that was made public early just for her – the 2021 KPMG Women’s PGA Champion heads into the off-season of 2022 with gear that is totally dialed.

“That’s the interesting part working with an elite athlete like her” said Van Wezenbeeck. “They’re always trying to get better.”

European aerospace major Airbus is looking to source green hydrogen from markets like India  Australia and Latin America as part of its decarbonisation efforts a senior company official said.Airbus is currently developing a hydrogen-powered fuel cell engine for its ambitious zero-emission aircraft that will enter service by 2035. It has also signed a partnership agreement with HyPort to set up a low-carbon hydrogen production and distribution station at the Toulouse-Blagnac airport in France.The cost of renewable energy production in India and Latin America among others make them attractive as potential supply hubs Glenn Llewellyn  VP Zero-Emission Aircraft at Airbus said.""One of the key activities that are underway at Airbus is to make sure that when we have a hydrogen aircraft available we also have green hydrogen at airports. So we are doing a lot of work with different airports and energy providers all across the world to make sure that green hydrogen is available at the right price when we need it"" Llewellyn told PTI on the sidelines of the Airbus Summit 2022 here.The hydrogen station at the Toulouse-Blagnac airport is slated to enter into service in early 2023. It will have a capacity to produce around 400 kilograms of hydrogen per day -- enough to power some 50 ground transportation vehicles.""There are no hydrogen-powered aircraft flying today but we can use hydrogen to decarbonise airport activities... this allows us to scale up hydrogen availability and prepare for the time when we need it for aircraft"" he noted.Replying to a question on the company's energy procurement strategy Llewellyn said ""We are looking at... how we can get hydrogen from places like India Australia and Latin America where we think the cost of hydrogen production is really interesting and what the value chain will be to get that hydrogen to other regions of the world where maybe it's more costly to produce locally.""India is also a key market for Airbus.'Green hydrogen' refers to hydrogen generated by renewable energy or from low-carbon power. It has significantly lower carbon emissions than 'grey hydrogen' which is derived from fossil fuels like natural gas. Grey hydrogen currently makes up the bulk of the hydrogen market.With a view to making the country a major player in the segment Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the National Hydrogen Mission on 15th August 2021. Under this initiative the country targets to produce 5 MT of green hydrogen by 2030.India has already announced its goal of increasing renewables capacity to 500 GW by 2030 and meeting 50 per cent of energy requirements from renewable sources.""India is an amazing location with huge potential for the production of (green) hydrogen at a very exciting cost"" Llewellyn said.""I would hope that one day we can have zero emission aircraft operating out of airports like Delhi and others at attractive price points based on home grown renewable energy ecosystem"" he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2JodWJhbmVzd2FyL29kaXNoYS1uZXctcG9saWN5LXRvLXByb21vdGUtdXNlLW9mLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3kvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTU5NzIyMDcuY21z0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvYmh1YmFuZXN3YXIvb2Rpc2hhLW5ldy1wb2xpY3ktdG8tcHJvbW90ZS11c2Utb2YtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTU5NzIyMDcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Odisha: New policy to promote use of renewable energy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2JodWJhbmVzd2FyL29kaXNoYS1uZXctcG9saWN5LXRvLXByb21vdGUtdXNlLW9mLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3kvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTU5NzIyMDcuY21z0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvYmh1YmFuZXN3YXIvb2Rpc2hhLW5ldy1wb2xpY3ktdG8tcHJvbW90ZS11c2Utb2YtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTU5NzIyMDcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C4914EFD60>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

It supplies lithium battery packs and chargers to some two and three-wheeler OEMs from a pilot facility at Tirupati.On the other hand the E-Hub will be equipped with advanced laboratories and testing infrastructure for material research prototyping product life-cycle analysis and proof-of-concept demonstration. The hub will cater to not just ARBL's requirements but also other players in the energy and mobility ecosystem.The proposed project for which the Amara Raja group inked an MoU with the Telangana government on Friday is expected to create around 4500 direct jobs.ARBL chairman and managing director Jayadev Galla said after challenging events like Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war the company decided to diversify and de-risk its business by stepping out of its home base in Chittoor AP.

Citizens have also benefited by generating solar for the grid and in lieu of which they have got at least 50% reduction in monthly electricity bills.""It is a one-time investment which is huge but comes with government subsidy"" said Sandeep Mhatre who has solar panels installed in his society off Ghodbunder Road in Thane. ""In our building solar- generated electricity can be used to electrify the staircase lights street lights within the society premises provide hot water on tap for bathing purposes."" Many societies also use solar for gardens and other common utilities as the power generated can benefit all.A V Shenoy member of Urja Prabodhan Kendra a think-tank in power sector said solar rooftop is feasible when you own an independent house and you are the only person using it. ""But in urban areas like Mumbai Thane or Navi Mumbai for an individual apartment to have a solar rooftop there will be practical problems. How will you distribute or meter it and it will not be sufficient whatever you generate on the rooftop"" he said.He further said: ""On the other hand in a housing society or gated community solar rooftops can be used for net metering which offsets the common utility area electricity bills every month. It helps save a lot of money for the housing society and the benefits can be passed on in the monthly maintenance bills to individual flat owners."" Housing societies can opt for a minimum 1 kilowatts peak (kWp) to maximum 500 kWp capacity solar panels.According to a power company official 1 kWp which may cost around Rs 46000 (before subsidy) will generate 1400-1500 units annually.""This comes to an average of 125 units per month. There will be a net metering system wherein whatever solar power you generate goes to the grid. And this is adjusted with your monthly electricity bill"" the official said.For instance if you generated 125 units through solar power in a month and consumed 300 units a month you will have to pay for just 175 units (300 minus 125) after deducting units generated by a solar rooftop. The savings could range from Rs 800 to Rs 2400 a month depending on 1-3 kWp of solar panel installed officials said. For higher kWp installations the benefits are huge.""If you generate more solar energy as per the contracted capacity there is also another possibility of not just your power bills being waived off but you earning extra money for the excess power generated"" said a senior MSEDCL officer. Recently 243 empanelled agencies for rooftop solar were directed to expedite applications for new installations and make the process easy in MMR and rest of the state. The power utility is now targeting monthly growth of 100MW to 150-MW solar energy in the grid.As per Mumbai Climate Action Plan a policy document released by BMC with Net Zero goal by 2050 Mumbai has the potential to generate 1724MW of solar power across rooftops of residential educational municipal buildings and industries in the island city and the suburbs.However urbanised areas like Mumbai still face challenges of space constraints to install the PV plates said power expert Ashok Pendse. ""People are environmentally conscious and want to opt for renewable energy like solar. However not everyone is able to install solar rooftops in Mumbai due to space issues.""Experts said renewable energy contributed 24.4% to the state's power mix most of it solar. This has prompted the state to launch an initiative to build solar plants throughout districts to produce a total 12 gigawatt of renewable energy over the next six years."

Coca-Cola Christmas truck goes up in flames to visitors' horror on Romanian leg of tour

The iconic Coca-Cola Christmas truck burst into flames on the Romanian leg of its tour across Europe.

Nobody was hurt in the fire that ripped through the legendary festive vehicle in Bucharest ahead of its weekend visits.

Horrified o nlookers could be seen standing on the side of the road helplessly watching the lorry roll down the road in flames.

Thankfully towards the end of the viral clip the blaze can be seen to have been extinguished as smoke continues to billow into the night air.

Footage posted by TikToker Stan Dumitru Arthur showed people desperately trying to control the smoke.

The good news is that the show will go on - Coca-Cola own a number of the trucks and the company are hopeful they won't have to disappoint hundreds of thousands of people.

The soft drink firm told local media it was taking measures to prevent further incidents.

The UK tour is already in full swing with visitors all over the UK and beyond set to get a glimpse of the iconic red lorry.

The truck tour started last Friday at Bluewater shopping centre in Dartford Kent before heading to Sainsbury's in Beckton east London for both Saturday and Sunday and then headed north to Farmhouse Inns in Linwood Renfrewshire all day on Tuesday.

There are still plenty of chances to catch it.

Belfast is set to play host to the lorry on December 16 and 17 while Dublin in the Irish Republic will be the venue for a three-day stint between 8 and 10th of the Christmas month.

Arguably one of the best things about the tour is that you can pick up free sample of the drinks while visiting the event.

The tour was cancelled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic but returned last year on a smaller scale than usual with dates and destinations only announced a day or so before to avoid Covid-19 related cancellations.

It's been 27 years since the Coca-Cola Christmas Truck first graced our TV screens. Since then it has become part of our festivities across the UK.

There's something evocative about the sound of the 'Holiday are Coming' as the truck rolls into a city or town that's already illuminated with Christmas lights. Millions of people have followed its journey over the years and it's even been used for marriage proposals.

It always draws crowds of people and gathers much excitement on social media as families await the arrival of the big red truck into their neighbourhood. This year's truck tour began on November 25 in Kent and it has since been to London Glasgow Manchester Bristol Bradford Cardiff and Leeds.

But who created the Coca Cola truck why is it so popular and how has it changed over the years? We look into the history of this relatively-modern Christmas tradition.

The timeline of the Coca-Cola Christmas Truck

1995 - the Coca-Cola Christmas Truck is born

It all began in 1995 as a Christmas advertising campaign. Created by agency W.B. Doner. the trucks were first known as ‘Christmas Caravans’.

But did you know that they had a surprising connection to Star Wars? Special effects by the world-famous Industrial Light and Magic the company behind the Star Wars films helped to make the illuminated lorries even more enchanting.

The iconic Coca-Cola Santa - designed by artist Haddon Sundblom in 1931 - was used to decorate the sides of the trucks. Just before the ad ended he was seen raising his bottle in a holiday toast.

1998 - the advert is watched by millions

Having used the trucks to introduce all-new 'Santa packs' of Coca‑Cola in 1996 featuring heritage Sundblom imagery the festive packaging became available in the USA the UK Australia Hong Kong South Africa Singapore and the Philippines.

In 1998 the ‘Christmas Caravan III’ advert was broadcast across more than 100 countries. It was watched by millions and remains one of the most widely used Coca‑Cola commercials ever produced.

Looking for Christmas days out? Join the thousands who have downloaded and listened to our Brummie Mummies Podcast here - it's packed full of fun ideas:

1999 - the famous 'Journey' ad is created

The famous ‘Journey’ advert was screened appearing to show a whole fleet of Coca-Cola Christmas trucks. In actual fact there were just three trucks and the rest were computer generated.

Filmed in Canada's snowy Vancouver the advert boasted a cast of 40 actors and told the story of the trucks springing to life in front of a boy and his grandfather as they sat at home reading a Christmas storybook.

2001 - the advert trucks 'come to life' and go on tour across the USA

It wasn't until six years after the advert was first broadcast that the 'Christmas Caravan' actually came to life. Coca-Cola embarked on its first road trip across America in 2001 bringing the truck to thousands of families.

“Christmas is a family season and that's what the spirit of the ‘Caravan’ ads is” said Ted Ryan Coca-Cola’s former chief archivist. ""As soon as the physical trucks began to visit communities it made the ads resonate a little bit more"" he said.

2007 - the adverts are brought back due to public demand

When Coca-Cola started taking its trucks on tour in 2001 the brand stopped using its traditional Christmas campaigns and adverts in the way that everybody had been used to. There was public uproar and so they brought back their famous campaigns marking the start of the festive season for many people.

2010 - the UK gets its first 'Christmas Caravan'

The Coca-Cola Christmas Truck remained an American phenomenon for many years until the soft drink brand embarked on trips across Europe. It became particularly popular in Germany.

But it didn't reach the UK until 2010 - nine years after the first truck tour in the USA. Since then millions of people have eagerly awaited its arrival as part of their countdown to Christmas.

2011 - the Christmas truck tour gets a celebrity launch in London

Singer and presenter Myleene Klass launched the start of the Coca-Cola truck tour in the UK in 2011. The former Hear'Say performer made a toast with her bottle of Coke in London to mark the opening of the tour.

2013 - public appetite for the truck tour grows

Throughout 2013 it is said that the hashtag #HolidaysAreComing was tweeted more than 57 million times. And in the same year around two million people visited the Coca-Cola website to find out where the truck would be stopping near them.

2015 - two truck tours begin to cope with public demand

In 2015 two trucks were introduced– one which started in the South and one which began its journey in the North. This was due to the fact that it had been so popular the previous year and one truck could not visit all the cities alone.

2017 - Coca-Cola Christmas trucks go down under

After making more than 300 stops in countries around the world Coca-Cola Christmas Trucks went down under making their first journey around Australia in 2017.

2018 - helping those in need

Over the last few years Coca-Cola has teamed up with British charities to try to help those in need whilst delivering joy and merriment on its travels. In 2019 the brand worked with homelessness charity Crisis to raise awareness and money by donating 10p in exchange for every can placed in their recycling bins throughout the truck tour.

2022

This year Coca Cola has said it will donate the equivalent of up to 100000 meals to those in need throughout the festive season. No Midland dates have been announced as yet.

The senior forward didn’t play Sunday in the Vols’ loss to Virginia Tech. Instead she appeared on the bench in street clothes.

Yet Jackson doesn’t seem to be injured and Harper called it a “coach’s decision” to keep the player off the floor.

Kellie Harper: Rickea Jackson is out as a coach's decision indefinitely.



Confirmed concussion protocol for Hollingshead and Franklin. — Cora Hall (@corahalll) December 4 2022

Jackson is Tennessee’s leading scorer so far this season averaging 17.6 points and shooting 54.1% from the field. She is also contributing 6.6 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game.

She came to Tennessee after entering the transfer portal from Mississippi State in January of last season.

The Detroit native cited the difficulties of playing for three coaches in three seasons as the reason for her departure. During her freshman year Mississippi State was coached by Vic Schaefer who then left for Texas and was replaced by Nikki McCray-Penson. She left the following year due to health concerns and Doug Novak was the interim coach when Jackson put her name in the transfer portal.

Jackson arrived in Tennessee as the top-ranked transfer heading into the 2022-23 season.

With or without Jackson the Vols are struggling. After starting the season ranked No. 5 in the Associated Press poll Tennessee has dropped out of the rankings entirely falling to 4-5 with losses to Virginia Tech Gonzaga UCLA Indiana and Ohio State.

Still Harper praised Jackson earlier in the year saying she and teammate Jordan Horston were “well-respected on the court” by their teammates.

But that came in response to a question about Tennessee’s on-court leader. The coach had to pause to come up with a response and she did not answer the question directly.

And with or without Jackson Tennessee’s schedule won’t be getting any easier. The Vols take on No. 2 Stanford on Dec. 18 and No. 6 UConn on Jan. 26. Then they head into SEC play where they take on opponents including No. 11 LSU No. 21 Arkansas and No. 1 South Carolina.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jb2xsZWdlLXNwb3J0cy9uby00LXVzYy1mYWxscy10by11dGFoLWluLXBhYy0xMi1hbGwtYnV0LWVuZGluZy1jb2xsZWdlLWZvb3RiYWxsLXBsYXlvZmYtaG9wZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No. 4 USC falls to Utah in Pac-12 all but ending College Football Playoff hope,"LAS VEGAS — No. 12 Utah pounded a limping bloodied Caleb Williams and roared past fourth-ranked Southern California 47-24 to not only win the Pac-12 Championship but all but end USC's College Football Playoff hopes.

The Prophet mobilized the youth under his banner through empowerment. Across all continents and cultures youth empowerment is one of the most discussed and applied programs/processes in the world today.

Thriving societies have more opportunities for young people to contribute their skills and talents. It is a way in which youth can make positive changes in their lives and in the lives of others.

The need for agency and a sense of authority is a vital factor for young people. It is a mechanism whereby they explore the “real world” and see where they “belong.”

One’s youth is a phase in life if directed properly can be a means of immense positivity and good. If misdirected however it can be a means of destruction and tragic consequences.

Unfortunately we find a huge percentage of youth in the contemporary period engaged in harmful behavior and unhealthy habits—not conducive to making the world a better place.

The Prophet was fully cognizant of the potential of the youth. With his incredible foresight he utilized and empowered the youth in his community. They were taught how to be real “men” and real “women” and indeed their greatness was visible through the extraordinary contributions they had left behind.

Zayd ibn Tahbit

Zayd ibn Thabit was among the generation of youth who were empowered by the Prophet. He was hardly thirteen years old when he came to seek permission from the Prophet to attend the historic battle of Badr.[1] He was not granted permission to join the Muslim Army as he was too young at the time.

However this did not prevent Zayd from contributing to the cause of Islam. The Prophet saw that Zayd had a sharp intellect and an unwavering thirst for knowledge. Hence he empowered him through scholarship. He instructed “Zayd learn the writing of the Jews for me.”[2]

Enthusiastically Zayd went about learning Hebrew and shortly after the Syriac language. This brilliant young man eventually found himself serving as an interpreter and scribe for the Prophet.

During the caliphate of Abu Bakr he was appointed to lead the massive project of compiling the Qur’an in a book form.[3] He was an expert in the Qur’an and a scholar of the highest caliber.

Till this day anyone who opens up a copy of the Qur’an is forever indebted to the great youth scholar Zayd ibn Thabit for his outstanding service to Islam.

This case presents to us some very valuable lessons. The Prophet’s methodology in identifying the skills of Zayd and then empowering him with that was one of the key reasons behind his success. It is imperative for us to pinpoint the talents within our communities and put them to work in order to bring about positive change.

Mus`ab ibn `Umair

The Prophet invested in the youth and placed his trust in them. He did not hesitate in assigning them pivotal roles despite their age. This provided the youth a feeling of “belonging.” The youth felt special because the Prophet entrusted them with serious responsibilities. Take Mus`ab ibn `Umayr for example. Mubarakpuri writes

“After the pledge of (`Aqabah) the Prophet sent to Yathrib (Medina) Mus`ab ibn `Umair al-`Abdari the first Muslim ambassador to teach the people the doctrines of Islam give them practical guidance and make attempts at propagating Islam among those who still professed polytheism.”[4]

The Prophet selected Mus`ab to carry out the task of teaching Islam to the people of Yathrib while many older and more experienced companions were present—the likes of Abu Bakr `Umar `Uthman `Ali and others. He knew Mus`ab was fully capable and thus empowered him through this honorable post. Yahiya Emerick notes in his biography of the Prophet

“Mus`ab was an excellent choice. Before his conversion he had been an idle child of wealth who indulged in great luxuries at his family’s expense. He had since redirected his life toward prayer and simple living. While in Yathrib he succeeded in converting many Arabs of both tribes to Islam including several prominent clan leaders.”[5]

Mubarakpuri further comments

“Mus`ab stayed in Medina carrying out his mission steadily and successfully until all the houses of al-Ansar had Muslim elements men and women.”[6]

Usamah ibn Zaid

Entrusting youth with leadership roles can be daunting a task but if done with precision and thought there will be astonishing results.

After the Farewell Pilgrimage a large army was organized and deployed to Syria. Abu Bakr and `Umar were involved in this campaign. But the Prophet appointed the young Usamah ibn Zayd to lead the army.

Al-Banna states very succinctly:

“Usamah was then a young man of hardly twenty years of age. His appointment was to honor the name of his father who had been killed while commanding at the battle of Mu’ta.

Such an appointment was also sure to stir within the blood of the youth the greatest determination and bravery. It was also meant as an example for the youth of Islam to carry the burden of great responsibility.”[7]

The “burden of great responsibility” was a spirit deeply cultivated in the hearts and minds of the youth. Entrusting Usamah with such a massive role did not only empower him as a young person but it also set a precedent for the entire community at large.

Naturally there were some people who felt uncomfortable with Usamah being their commander. The Prophet stood up on his pulpit and said

“O Men! Carry out the expedition under Usamah. Your complaint against his generalship is of the same kind as your complaint against the generalship of his father before him. By Allah! Usamah is as fit for the generalship as was his father.”[8]

From this we can deduce that in order to further a cause and establish a viable community elders must delegate significant roles to the youth and place confidence in them. This will create a culture of respect in the younger generation for the older generation. Moreover it will generate fresh new leaders who are capable of handling new challenges in an ever-changing world.

Over a span of twenty-three years the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) successfully completed his mission and raised a generation of youth that carried the light of Islam to all four corners of the world.

Eternal Lessons

By treating them with love the Prophet was able to establish astounding relationships with the young people of his time. His vision and implementation of youth empowerment yielded victory upon victory and continued for generations to come.

There are innumerable lessons for the contemporary world to take from the Sirah in regards to the youth.

In a time when our young generation has lost their sense of direction and moral compass in life it is high time that we study the life of the Prophet Muhammad. It is anticipated that by doing this we will be able to reorient ourselves to that which is healthy and productive for both our youth and our world.

No. 13 Florida State (9-3) will face Oklahoma (6-6) in the Cheez-It Bowl at Camping World Stadium in Orlando it was announced Sunday.

The game will kick off Dec. 29 at 5:30 p.m. and will be televised on ESPN.

Florida State has won five straight games and has one of the top offenses in the country led by former Benjamin School standout Jordan Travis.

This will be the first bowl game for the Seminoles under third-year head coach Mike Norvell and first for the program since 2019. They'll look to cap their first winning season since 2017 by winning 10 games for the first time since beating Michigan in the Orange Bowl in 2016.

Lynne Sladky/AP Florida State head coach Mike Norvell watches from the sideline during the first half against Miami Saturday Nov. 5 2022 in Miami Gardens Fla.

Meanwhile Oklahoma is trying to avoid its first losing season since 1998 – the year before former head coach Bob Stoops got to Norman.

Florida State has won all three previous appearances in the game most recently in 2011 against Notre Dame when it was known as the Champs Sports Bowl. The Seminoles also won the 2008 Champs Sports Bowl against Wisconsin and the inaugural game in 1990 when it was known as the Blockbuster Bowl and played in South Florida.

The late Bobby Bowden's first bowl win as head coach of the Seminoles came in Orlando against Texas Tech in the Tangerine Bowl.

The Seminoles are 1-6 all-time against the Sooners. Florida State hasn't beaten Oklahoma since their first meeting – a 36-19 win in the 1965 Gator Bowl.

Oklahoma defeated Florida State 13-2 in the Orange Bowl during Stoops' second season in 2000 to win the national championship."

The billionaire developer has big plans to turn the failing Fashion District mall into a glimmering basketball palace. But first he’ll need to convince the neighbors that it won’t be one giant boondoggle.

Get a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!

On a Monday afternoon in October David Adelman stands at the corner of 11th and Market streets imagining an alternate universe. He points across the street at fast-fashion retailer Primark its logo glowing windshield-wiper-fluid blue in the distance. “So this” he says “is where the arena would go.”

Before we can consider the world in which there’s a $1.3 billion arena for the Philadelphia 76ers on the site of the Fashion District mall in the heart of Center City however we must face reality. Adelman in a military green bomber jacket dark pants and stylish leather boots his mane of thick black hair perfectly combed back begins to walk down Market Street. He passes a row of uninspired single-story retail — his future neighbors if all goes according to plan. There’s a dismal Panda Express a methadone clinic a boarded-up Reebok store and a closed-down pawnshop with a large red dumpster in front.

The Sixers have been trying to move for a while. In 2020 Josh Harris and David Blitzer the two New York finance billionaires who own the team proposed building a new arena plus 10 residential towers on Penn’s Landing. They also wanted more than $800 million in public subsidies. When that staggeringly bold plan flopped the Sixers approached Adelman who has more than a little development experience as CEO of student-housing behemoth Campus Apartments to dream up an entirely new arena project. One of the reasons Harris and Blitzer were so keen to move was simple: Billionaires prefer to be landlords not tenants and the Sixers were paying rent to Comcast for the right to play in the Wells Fargo Center. The 26-year-old facility was quickly becoming obsolete — especially by the standards of the NBA which has seen a spate of extravagant new arenas open in recent years. In turning to Adelman Harris and Blitzer enlisted a professional landlord to help make themselves into one.

Adelman also came highly recommended by Michael Rubin CEO of sports-apparel company Fanatics and until recently holder of the team’s third-largest ownership stake. If the Penn’s Landing proposal failed because it featured an out-of-town developer and a request for public subsidies this time would be different: Adelman who’s 50 has spent his entire life except for four years at Ohio State in the Philly region. A lifelong Sixers fan he’s had four courtside seats by the team’s bench for years. He told Harris and Blitzer “The only way I’d be interested is under the following circumstances: One we can’t take any city money. And two we can’t threaten to leave the city.” Harris and Blitzer agreed.

With that Adelman was in. He started scouting potential sites including around 30th Street Station and at Spring Garden and Front streets. Eventually he landed on Market East and the idea of demolishing the western half of the Fashion District mall a hideous gray box that has about as much appeal as the abandoned retail across the street from it. The site has advantages: It’s a transit hub with more than 220 different stops — from the Market-Frankford Line to Regional Rail to PATCO — feeding into Jefferson Station which sits beneath the mall. And Adelman felt this stretch of Market Street was an under-utilized no-man’s-land the missing link between Old City to the east and the shiny high-rise offices to the west. “I thought it was a civic obligation to help fix up the city and add an ­economic-development driver” he says. The Fashion District owners who’d poured $400 million into renovating it right before the pandemic hit were all too willing to have their monument to poor decision-making taken off their hands.

Now Adelman turns left and crosses the street to head into the mall grinning as we ride an escalator down to the bottom level. With a wild look in his eyes he declares that we’re now standing courtside. Where we’re actually standing is in a passageway between SEPTA’s Jefferson Station and the mall. “You’re going to be able to come out from the train station enter into the arena and then walk up” he says. If it’s built the 18500-seat space will disrupt and transform Center City in equal measure. If everything goes as planned it will open in 2031 when the team’s current lease expires.

If. If if if. There are lots of them. Just one block from the proposed arena is Chinatown a tight-knit community of 3000 Asian Americans that’s been bisected disrupted and nearly destroyed by various projects undertaken in the name of urban renewal and vague notions of the greater civic good. Few people in Chinatown are cheering the arena proposal. At their most sympathetic they’re open to the possibility of it being built while also deeply fearful that the project will jolt property values displace residents and business owners and erase the soul of the neighborhood. At their least sympathetic they’ve rejected the arena altogether and are organizing against it. Adelman has been meeting with community members in hopes of coming to an agreement on how the team can support Chinatown’s future and as it recently pledged in a local ad campaign “be a great neighbor.” Without such an agreement the project may well die in its infancy. City Councilmember Mark Squilla who represents the area says he “doesn’t see a way forward” without the agreement.

Adelman doesn’t feel daunted by the stakes. Why should he? He’s been on a winning streak lately: Tapped to build this project he also recently struck a deal with Rubin one of his best friends to buy out most of Rubin’s 10 percent stake in the franchise. Adelman is now the third largest owner of the team he rooted for as a kid. And he may just get to build their new home.

Still Adelman has never done anything like this before — not even close. His own family was skeptical his wife and two daughters asking if he knew how to build a project on this scale. He told them “No but I’ll figure it out!”

“I’ve built apartments I’ve built hotels I’ve built retail I’ve done all the components of this” Adelman says. “How many guys in the U.S. have built an arena? Twenty? Fifty? So I was like ‘Why not me?’”

•

Before the Sixers announced plans for the arena Adelman met with a number of Chinatown groups and community members to privately share what the team had in mind. He explained that by developing an existing commercial property he wouldn’t be displacing any residents; in fact he told them the Sixers want to increase affordable housing in the neighborhood.

Reactions to his outreach were mixed. John Chin head of the influential Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation a nonprofit that’s developed more than 600 affordable housing units in the neighborhood and funded other projects was confused. “My brain could not comprehend how the arena would fit on that site” he says. His fundamental view was — and still is — that “arenas and neighborhoods don’t mix.” According to Adelman former City Councilmember Helen Gym’s initial response was that she should have been informed of the project earlier. (A Gym spokesperson says Adelman mischaracterized this conversation and that her main concern was over a lack of community engagement.) Asian Americans United a long-standing activist group that previously organized against proposed Chinatown developments — Gym was once a member — didn’t have any reaction at all: It wasn’t informed beforehand. “Throwing a big proposal to Chinatown without asking the opinion of Chinatown — it’s not fair and it’s not respectful” says Wei Chen the group’s civic engagement coordinator. (Adelman and the Sixers have since met with group members.)

Adelman says he never bulldozed in with ultimatums and always intended to incorporate the community’s feedback; it simply wasn’t possible to meet with every community group before the announcement. “I’m the kind of person that if I made a mistake I would own it” Adelman says of the rollout. “There’s nothing about this I would do differently.” He thinks the arena still has more supporters than not. “If you looked at my LinkedIn page the day we announced 95 percent of the comments were positive” he says. “The texts I got from business leaders community leaders restaurant owners: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.”

But Adelman comes into Chinatown as an outsider and his first step didn’t exactly engender trust. Nor did it help when just over a week after the Sixers made their public announcement news broke that the team would also be purchasing the Greyhound bus station on Filbert Street one block north of the mall. By Chin’s definition of boundaries this meant the arena crossed the threshold into Chinatown. Adelman says public renderings always showed the arena extending into the bus terminal; he simply hadn’t highlighted it. But for community groups wary of encroachment this validated their concerns. Adelman admits the bus-station situation was a “foot fault” but chafes at the suggestion of impure motives. “That is a big stretch to say I’m displacing a Chinatown business and resident by buying the bus station” he says. “I don’t know if you’ve seen the bus station? It’s a piece of shit. It literally smells like urine as you walk by the street.” He contends that ultimately the arena is “not a Chinatown project.”

Whatever your definition Chinatown has a long fraught history of intrusive developments. In the 1970s PennDOT used eminent domain to seize more than 300 properties many in Chinatown to build the Vine Street Expressway which cut the neighborhood in half. In 1993 the city built the Convention Center on the western border displacing residents. Other ­projects — the original Gallery the Center City commuter tunnel linking Suburban Station and Market East — changed the area. Each time Chinatown residents were told how the projects would benefit them. More often than not they didn’t; such construction was rarely for their benefit. For every completed project there’s a story of one that Chinatown mobilized against: a prison a casino a Phillies stadium.

Then there’s the case of Washington D.C. with all its echoes. In 1994 Washington Bullets owner Abe Pollin announced his plans to build a new arena for his team in D.C.’s Chinatown. The Washington Post wrote that “some people voiced concerns about street access to the Chinatown location and the availability of parking” but that the dominant emotion was “genuine euphoria” and that “business leaders hailed the proposed complex as a catalyst for the revitalization of a beleaguered city.” Pollin was quoted as saying “I have faith in the future of this city and I am prepared to take the risk and get this done.” (He promised the arena would be privately financed; it ended up costing the city $50 million.)

The district’s Chinatown was already in decline in part due to the construction of a convention center in the neighborhood and the arena did little to stem the tide. Three thousand Asian people once lived in D.C.’s Chinatown; these days fewer than 500 do. Many of the surviving businesses are national chains that have replaced Chinese ones; their attempts at cultural awareness ring hollow. “It’s just ‘Chipotle’ written in Chinese” says Jenny Zhang an organizer for the Pennsylvania chapter of the Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance. A group of D.C. Chinatown residents published a recent op-ed in the Inquirer warning that “it isn’t a lack of tourism that kills Chinatown economies; it’s when Asian people stop coming because there is no parking or the businesses they rely on shut down.” The op-ed warned: “Don’t make the same mistake.”

But the D.C. Chinatown case “isn’t 100 percent comparable” says Dan Tsao a business owner in Philly’s Chinatown and community leader who also publishes newspapers in Chinese Vietnamese and Korean. Adelman has been trying to hammer home the same point. For one thing Pollin’s project created an arena where there was previously nothing of the sort. Adelman argues he’s merely switching one commercial use for another from mall to arena. Far from hurting businesses as D.C.’s arena did Adelman says he’ll add customers. He finds other parallels equally unconvincing. “The Phillies stadium 20 years ago would have been in the middle of Chinatown displacing properties and businesses” he says. “And I think the rallying cry that this is the same thing is inaccurate not fair and not reality.”

Adelman believes he can assuage many of the community’s concerns. “Right now there’s a public-safety issue going on in the city in general but in that area in particular” he says. “What we do here will help solve a lot of public safety by having people on the street. And two we can enhance lighting and cameras. And then three we have a real focus on making the community better and we’ll invest in affordable housing.” The Sixers have partnered with Mosaic Development Partners a Black-owned development firm with a track record of building mixed-income projects that don’t kick out longtime residents. Adelman meanwhile is attempting to convene a “community benefits steering committee” — a group of leaders representing the various constituencies in Chinatown that the Sixers will negotiate with in hopes of reaching an agreement. (Similar community benefits agreements were hashed out when the Phillies and Eagles built new stadiums in South Philly in the early 2000s and when Rivers Casino was erected in Northern Liberties; they typically involve the developers paying an annual sum — $1 million in the case of the South Philly stadium district — to fund projects at the community’s discretion.)

But how much stock to put in promises? Everyone from Adelman to Councilmember Squilla says a community benefits agreement must be reached for the arena to be built. (There’s a separate question of whether a representative sample of the community is even possible; Asian Americans United has already said it won’t participate in negotiations and is circulating a petition against the arena that it says has over 7000 signatures.) Because a project of this size will likely require zoning legislation which will need to be introduced by Squilla Chinatown has considerable leverage. But for now uncertainty reigns. Zhang contends that an arena will simply re-create the “dead-zone feel” of the Convention Center. “When nothing is happening no one is there and anyone who has walked past the Convention Center at night knows it doesn’t feel safe” she says. Chin likewise remains unconvinced. “I still have the same questions I did many weeks ago when I was first introduced to the project” he says. A community benefits agreement only fulfills its promise if the original community remains in place to reap those benefits.

And if there is no agreement? Adelman has mostly focused on what he can offer to Chinatown. In one conversation he took the opposite tack: “What happens if we don’t build the arena? What’s the path for that mall when you think about the fact that it’s in decline? What if it heads to a bankruptcy and it sits empty?”

He declines to say whether his deal with the mall owner has a contingency clause in the event the arena doesn’t move forward but he mentions that the current zoning on Market Street allows any developer to build residential towers by right no special permission required. “What if someone knocks it down and by right can build three Comcast towers?” Adelman asks. He says there’s a “naivete in the community” about the public-safety problems along Market Street: “No one wants to talk about what could happen here vs. the economic input this has.” The Sixers he says want to invest in public safety and affordable housing. “What other impetus would there be to solve those problems and anchor and bolster the community? I can’t think of one.”

When Adelman was 11 he challenged a family friend to a game of basketball. The friend was Alan Horwitz who happened to run a small real estate empire in West Philadelphia by the name of Campus Apartments. The two made a wager on the game. “Most people let the 11-year-old win” Adelman says. “He didn’t.”

This would prove significant: It was Adelman’s entrée into real estate. As the story he often tells goes he lost his basketball and baseball glove and began working at Campus Apartments to earn them back. He got hooked. Real estate he says was like “a fascination and an addiction merged together.” He officially became a landlord for the first time at 13 when he had $2000 in bar mitzvah money to spend and sank it into one of Horwitz’s apartment buildings. Adelman who grew up on the Main Line — his father was a psychologist; his mother stayed home — continued to work at Campus during the summers. He gave tours to prospective tenants painted did other odd jobs. One year he had an epiphany: He’d messed up and hit a plumbing line and now excrement was spewing everywhere. “I remember thinking to myself I don’t want to be the guy standing in shit when I’m older” he says. Fortunately he was family friends with the CEO and had an in. After four years away for college at Ohio State he returned to Philly in 1994 and started working at Campus Apartments immediately.

Adelman had visions of being more than a local landlord. In 2000 he struck a deal with Penn to manage all of its off-campus housing thinking if he could do it for Penn he could do it for anyone. Horwitz slightly confused as to why his protégé was so keen on rocking the boat was content to step back. Adelman became CEO of the company before he turned 30.

“He’s kinetic energy personified” says Campus Apartments chief investment officer Dan Bernstein who’s worked with Adelman for 25 years. When Adelman first wanted to expand the company he considered taking it public but ultimately decided to take on private investment. He went on a pitching bonanza and convinced the public investment fund of Singapore to give him $300 million which prompted new projects nationwide. “I’d never raised a dollar before” Adelman says. The company now owns more than $2 billion in real estate.

When Adelman took over Campus Apartments the neighborhood around Penn was in crisis. Crime was high; in the span of two years a grad student had been murdered an undergrad had been shot and a research associate had been stabbed to death — all in robberies. “West Philly was going to hell in a handbasket” says Drexel president John Fry a Penn executive at the time. Fry decided to create a business improvement district to fund amenities like lighting and foot patrols. He went around to various landlords asking for support and couldn’t get a meeting with one exception: David Adelman. Fry made his pitch. Adelman said “Well how much do you need?” and committed $50000 on the spot. Twenty-five years later Adelman still serves on the University City District board.

In conversations about the arena Adelman cites the University City District as a raging success. “I watched the effect firsthand of what a coordinated effort around public safety and cleanliness does” he says. “I can help deliver that to Chinatown and Washington West right now and it won’t cost the city anything.” But his tenure as Campus Apartments CEO coincided with significant gentrification in West Philly. The Spruce Hill neighborhood was 65 percent Black in 2000; that fell to 22 percent per 2020 census data. Median home prices have risen from under $200000 in 2000 to nearly $600000. “I think everyone whether we’re talking about David or we’re talking about Penn or the other universities we have to admit that there should have been much more of an intentional focus on anti-displacement strategies on equity on making sure Black and brown working-class folks can live and access all benefits” says City Councilmember Jamie Gauthier who represents much of West Philly. “I hope that folks who have seen including David what’s going on in West Philly come at development with a different perspective now.”

Adelman says he supports affordable housing requirements for new construction projects but if there were missteps in West Philly he doesn’t see them committed by Campus Apartments the University City District or Penn which offered low-interest mortgages to staff to encourage them to buy homes there. “I actually think it was the opposite effect” he says “where an organized effort by an institution providing capital infrastructure and services stabilized the area.” He steers the conversation back to the arena. “Look what’s happening right now at 10th and Market where you have shootings all the time and random acts of violence in the mall.” (There was one gunshot fired in the mall in September — no one was hit — and according to police there has been one shooting victim in the two-block radius surrounding the proposed arena so far this year.) Adelman goes on “I see a similar problem that needs to be solved.”

Adelman rides up the escalator from Brooklyn’s Atlantic Terminal subway stop and the Barclays Center comes into view: large brown shaped like a futuristic toilet seat. “The energy is amazing” he says stepping onto the plaza in front of the arena. As part of his research he’s been touring other arenas across the country; today he and a few Sixers employees are checking out the Nets’ facilities while catching their first pre-season game of the year which happens to be against the Sixers.

Across the street from the arena is a strip of retail. A Barclays Center employee giving the tour explains that these used to be mom-and-pop shops; now they’re a Chick Fil-A a Snipes and a facade with an ad reading BROOKLYN FLAGSHIP REDEVELOP — COMING 2020. Adelman marching through spitting rain looks over and says quietly “This could be better.”

Inside the arena Adelman strides through the main concourse which maintains Brooklyn’s chic color scheme of black and gray and dim lighting. Occasionally the concessions stands stop and you catch a glimpse of the court; it’s like staring into an amphitheater. There’s a pop-up zone where local businesses can set up on a rotating basis — maybe something like that could exist in Philly for Chinatown restaurants Adelman muses. He admires a Grab and Go store where you tap your credit card and the system automatically knows what to charge you — no checkout required.

The tour moves on to the luxurious suites at the arena: an outpost of the 40/40 Club which is owned by Jay-Z with plenty of gold trim and bird’s-eye views of the court. There’s the Qatar Club with windows looking out on the players’ tunnel. And most swankily there’s the Crown Club a space so opulent it’s as if you’ve teleported through the looking glass into a five-star restaurant: plush banquettes chandeliers gold wallpaper depicting a scene of flowers and birds. There’s even a dedicated candy “pantry” where fans can grab anything they want.

At dinner at the Crown Club a server informs us that Nets owner and Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai has graciously selected wine for our evening: a 2018 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru ($395 a bottle) and a 2017 Gevrey-Chambertin Premier Cru ($325 a bottle). A feast from the Italian restaurant Carbone ensues: spicy rigatoni veal parmesan radicchio salad shrimp scampi with fennel. You’d be forgiven for forgetting there’s a basketball game to come. “How do we even reciprocate to the Nets when they come to Philly?” Adelman asks the other Sixer employees at one point somewhere between sheepish and joking. “Give them hot dogs?” (Adelman while appreciative of the Barclays Center largesse says this level of bougie-ness would never work in the Philly market. “I have a different vision” he says.)

After dinner Adelman makes his way to his seat. He typically posts a picture for his 40000 Instagram followers before every Sixers game he attends but this time he’s in the ninth row which for him practically amounts to Siberia. “If I post from here people might think the recession has already started” he jokes. (He ends up posting a zoomed-in shot of the Jumbotron.) After two quarters — a chunk of it spent on his phone reviewing a work presentation — bad weather is coming and Adelman is due back in Philly the next morning; he works out at 6 a.m. sharp daily and has a boxing session with a personal trainer scheduled. He rushes to a black car waiting at the loading dock; the car ascends the elevator to the street level then deposits him at a pier on Wall Street. He marches to a helipad and flies off to Philly — takeoff to touchdown in just 30 minutes.

A few days later I take a tour of the Wells Fargo Center at Adelman’s suggestion with a group of Sixers PR officials. Everyone is perfectly kind and respectful to the Comcast landlords but the subtext is clear: You’ve seen the Barclays; now look at the shithole we’re in.

The tour begins with the players’ locker room. Modern locker rooms these days have LED screens and chargers for players; here there are none. The Sixers have one TV in the entire space. Down a linoleum-floored hallway that looks like the basement of a high school we enter the weight room. The Sixers share this area with the Flyers but it’s not big enough to fit both teams’ equipment so someone has to wheel the Flyers’ stationary bikes out of the room before games. The trainer’s room where players take ice baths looks like a morgue. Until recently when the team converted some office space there was no place for Sixers to eat pre-game. There’s no place for chefs to cook pre-game meals for visiting teams; I saw them lined up in a hallway stirring fried rice in a giant wok.

This has its competitive disadvantages if you consider that each time an opposing player enters your arena it’s a chance to show off (or in this case not show off) your state-of-the-art facilities — subliminal free-agency recruitment. The Sixers are paying out of their own pocket for a $9 million renovation to expand and relocate the team’s locker room but the building is the building and there’s only so much you can do. “It’s like putting lipstick on a pig” says a Sixers employee. Separately Comcast is overseeing a $360 million renovation which has included updates to things like plumbing and HVAC as well as to public-facing portions of the arena. (A back-of-the-house revamp including the remaining locker rooms is also planned.) There are now restaurants from Stephen Starr Jose Garces and Marc Vetri inside the arena but they’re all on the club level way up where the corporate suites used to be back when the arena was first built. These days basketball diehards want to be close to the action.

After the tour I catch another Sixers pre-season game with Adelman this one against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Adelman runs into Cavs forward Kevin Love pre-game and hugs him. Whether through proximity to people like Michael Rubin who’s an A-list networker and friends with people like Drake and James Harden or just by sheer proximity to the court over the years Adelman has for a real estate guy attained an unusual level of closeness to celebrity. In fairness he isn’t just a real estate guy anymore. In 2007 he co-founded the investment firm FS Investments alongside fellow Philadelphian Michael Forman. (FS now constitutes the single largest portion of his net worth which Business Insider recently estimated at $1.6 billion.) And for the past 15 years Adelman has had his own venture capital fund Darco Capital investing in a range of companies from highly sustainable and buzzy (the world’s first carbon-neutral milk) to not so sustainable but still buzzy (private-jet service Wheels Up). He even has his own line of spirits: a vodka distilled in Idaho and a whiskey distilled in Houston.

These days many athletes seek out business guys for advice. Adelman has brought LeBron James Tobias Harris and Russell Wilson into some of his investments — part of the appeal behind friendship with someone like him. “I think one of the big problems with a lot of rich people is they’re painfully boring” Rubin says. “David’s not like that. David’s fun he’s young he’s vibrant he’s got a good personality.” Adelman has been to Rubin’s tabloid-bonanza “white party” in the Hamptons during the summer alongside the likes of Jay-Z Beyoncé Drake and Kendall Jenner. Adelman has also made rounds in the film world; his wife Hallee is a documentary-film producer and the duo have attended film festivals like Sundance. “She’s the creative type; I’m just the dumb capitalist” Adelman jokes.

Those closest to Adelman rave about his generosity. He’s surprised friends with sudden-notice private-jet trips to the Masters golf tournament in Georgia and a Genesis concert in London. At the Sixers game I saw him order a chicken cheesesteak and a cheeseburger and tip the server $100. (Adelman is a health nut and generally eschews bread; he ate the cheesesteak filling off the roll with a fork.) On the court he ordered a soft pretzel — another $100 tip. Though he’s grown richer and more famous his personality hasn’t changed according to John Fry: “There’s none of that bullshit that ego. There’s no brashness. I mean David knows what he’s accomplished; he’s gonna need a healthy ego. But it’s a healthy ego. He’s not the guy who swaggers into the room and tells you how great he is. I’ve never seen that. And honestly I’ve seen that from a lot of people who have accomplished a quarter of what David has accomplished.”

As Adelman watches the Sixers go through pre-season motions against the Cavs he explains how his new arena will be different. “We designed it from the sight lines in vs. from the court out” he says. That means seats will be sloped at the ideal angle for basketball-viewing unlike at the Wells Fargo Center which was designed for hockey. (The new arena will accommodate hockey too just in case the Flyers and Comcast ever want to cut bait; Comcast has been offered an ownership stake.) The building which has a quasi-pyramid shape with grass and solar panels on the roof will feature retail and restaurants facing the street that will open to the public on non-game nights. (The Sixers play just 41 regular-­season home games each year although the arena could also host concerts and other events.) A stretch of Filbert Street will be lined with food vendors and convert to a covered pedestrian market on off-days. “I feel like people in Philly don’t think they should have nice things” Adelman says. “We deserve nice things. We’re going to have a great place.” He laments the Philly trait of “just getting by with the status quo.” This applies as much to what the arena looks like as to where it is. Despite plenty of fretting over where fans — especially suburban ones — will park downtown Adelman says that 20 percent of Sixers fans already take SEPTA to games and that half come from Center City. (So far this season transit ridership has been closer to seven percent according to SEPTA figures.) Per the team’s surveys an estimated 50 percent would take transit or walk to the new arena and just 3150 parking spots — less than half the current number — would be required. “I know that I’m kind of going against 50 years of muscle memory of people going into South Philadelphia” Adelman says. “But that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.”

•

Adelman frames the arena in symbolic practically existential terms. “We’re the poorest big city education gun violence” he says rattling off woes. “It makes people always count Philly out. We need this. We need to be a beacon of hope. People need to know we’re not giving up.” Adelman will be investing his own money here — $300 million to $400 million split between himself Harris and Blitzer — and says his motivations are more civic than financial. (A quick word about those finances: While the Sixers initially pledged the arena would be privately funded Adelman has since opened up the door to taking state or federal dollars; the only red line he says is taking city funds.) “This is going to be one of the biggest personal checks I ever write for a single investment anywhere and I’m doing it in Philadelphia” he says. “That’s how committed I am to this. There’s a lot of money in the world. That’s a lot of money for David Adelman okay?”

It’s undeniably shrewd to have a Philadelphian leading the arena development this time around. Adelman’s varied business and civic commitments — he also chairs the board of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia — have helped him cultivate connections to many of the city’s most influential figures. Ryan Boyer head of the city’s building trades calls him “a genius an innovator.” Mayor Jim Kenney declined an interview request but said in a statement that “it was exciting to hear the proposal for Fashion District Philadelphia as we believe it has the potential to be an ideal site for a world-class sports and entertainment arena.” Adelman says the Mayor was “ecstatic” about the proposal.

Given the project’s timeline Adelman’s relationship with the next mayor figures to be even more important. “They’ve done a good job meeting with all the potential serious mayoral candidates being agnostic on who they support and making sure they support the project” Boyer says of Adelman and the Sixers. Whether Adelman is himself agnostic isn’t clear. He can’t donate directly to city candidates due to his involvement with FS Investments and restrictions affecting asset managers but he attended a dinner hosted by prospective candidate Jeff Brown the supermarket owner who’s the darling of the city’s business class. Adelman downplays his attendance saying he’s “spent time with lots of the folks that are considering a run just because I care about the city.” Despite his friendliness with city Democrats he’s lived in Haverford for the past 16 years and is a registered Republican having made federal donations to everyone from Marco Rubio and Brian Fitzpatrick to Bob Casey and Susan Wild. “Honestly I wish I could be a registered centrist” he says.

Maybe the biggest advantage the Sixers have in Adelman is that very few people seem to dislike him — no small feat considering the two words that first come to mind when describing him are “billionaire” and “developer.” Progressive Councilmember Gauthier calls him a “good friend” though they agree on virtually nothing and many of her bills on Council including a zoning law that mandates affordable housing units in all new large construction projects directly impact Campus Apartments. “I think the fact that we have a relationship allows us to talk through some very difficult issues and to land on at least some semblance of common ground” she says. “We’re not coming to the table as enemies; we’re coming to the table as friends who just often see the world differently.” Ali Perelman who runs Philadelphia 3.0 the nonprofit that spends on City Council races — Adelman helps fund its expenditures that aren’t on political ­campaigns — describes him as a “very menschy dude. … In Philly it’s tough to find people that are universally well-liked. We have so many camps and factions and grudges and all that BS. That alone is kind of a distinguishing characteristic of this person.”

Perhaps that’s why Adelman feels he may yet win over some of his biggest skeptics — even Helen Gym. “If we get the community benefits agreement right and she sees I’m not full of shit who knows?” he says. “I think everything is on the table.” Gym declined to comment.

•

By early November everything was still on the table. Negotiations with Chinatown were proceeding in fits and starts but the contours of the discussions were emerging. Adelman and the Sixers have been to Chinatown between 20 and 25 times according to Tsao the business owner and publisher to talk and meet with various groups. He and other business owners insisted that if the team was going to follow through with its covered-market plan for Filbert Street Chinatown restaurant owners should be first in line to lease any space for Asian concepts. The Sixers agreed. Tsao also raised the concern that existing business owners could be forced to compete against national brands for their leases; he says the Sixers agreed to consider creating a fund for business owners to offset potential rent increases. Tsao has found Adelman to be a willing negotiator. “Even though David Adelman is a billionaire he hasn’t put off any attitude” he says. By his estimate 95 percent of community leaders in Chinatown are still “not taking any position” on the proposal and waiting to learn more.

The Sixers meanwhile have been proactive. One of Tsao’s media outlets published an article about Asian Americans United’s strong opposition to the arena project. The piece was written in Chinese and only accessible via WeChat the social media app used by Chinese people worldwide. The next day someone from the Sixers reached out to Tsao asking to provide a response to the critiques in the story.

Slowly the community benefits steering committee has been coming into focus. According to Tsao there will be between 13 and 15 members: four umbrella community groups including the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation; three business owners including himself; three Chinatown residents; and three religious organizations. AAU has been invited to join; it declined. “We’re still at phase one” Tsao says. Phase two should involve more specifics: raw numbers economic impact studies. “Then I think the whole negotiation is going to be escalated to a different level” he says. Eventually the Sixers will expand the discussion to include neighborhoods and businesses outside Chinatown as well. Adelman tells me the Sixers will soon be proposing a $50 million payment as the centerpiece of its community benefits agreement. The money — a mix of cash up front and funds to be paid out over 30 years — would mostly go to projects in Chinatown. But what projects? And is $50 million enough?

A few weeks earlier Adelman stood at the intersection of 10th and Filbert his tour of the mall and the would-be arena concluded. This stretch of road might eventually be his imagined pedestrian marketplace. The underperforming stores on the south side of Market Street might one day be replaced with housing and retail that’s actually open. But for now the first community benefits steering committee meeting Adelman’s chance to pitch the team’s $50 million proposal loomed. Something would happen at the meeting — however it ended up going — and knowing how much opposition he is or isn’t up against would constitute progress. “I might get the shit kicked out of me!” Adelman said. He smiled then turned and walked up 10th Street into the distance passing beneath an overpass that read for now in giant letters FASHION DISTRICT.

Published as “Full Court Press” in the December 2022 issue of Philadelphia magazine.

Since this article appeared in print Helen Gym resigned from City Council. We have updated her title in this version and have included a response from her about the first conversation she had with Adelman about the arena. This article has also been updated to reflect the facility upgrades currently underway at Wells Fargo Center."

With that backdrop here's a closer look at three tickers with great shots at turning a $1000 investment today into $5000 as soon as 2030. Notice that each company brings something special to the table at an ideal time.

Monster Beverage

The world needs a serious pick-me-up if the recent sales growth achieved by energy drink outfit Monster Beverage (MNST 0.47%) is any indication. The company's top line is up nearly 16% through the first three quarters of this year extending a span of comparable revenue growth underway for over a decade now. Analysts don't see any real slowdown on the horizon either modeling 11% sales growth next year that's apt to be topped when all is said and done.

Yes Monster Beverage is the outfit behind energy drinks of the same brand name but it's not just Monster. The company also manages Nos Full Throttle Predator and a handful of other energy drink brands. Monster is its flagship though making up the lion's share of its annual top line of around $6 billion.

It's not a lot. But that's the point -- there's room for the entire category to continue growing. And it is. Mordor Intelligence estimates the energy drinks business is on pace to grow by more than 8% per year through 2027 jibing with other growth outlooks for the industry. Monster has something of a secret weapon however helping it win more than its fair share of this growth.

That's Coca-Cola.

Coke has been a Monster stakeholder and partner since 2015. The relationship is still being increasingly leveraged for growth though and yet there's so much more that could be done going forward. Take cannabis for instance. While Coca-Cola doesn't offer cannabis-based drinks right now it is entering new and once-unlikely markets.

For example early this year Coca-Cola entered the alcoholic beverage fray by inking a developmental deal with Constellation Brands...the same Constellation reportedly mulling an acquisition bid for Monster. It's noteworthy simply because Constellation also owns a sizable stake in cannabis company Canopy Growth Corp. and Coca-Cola has at least entertained the possibility of entering the cannabis arena in the recent past.

It's unclear how or if any of these possible combinations and partnerships will shake out. What is clear is that Monster Beverage is well-positioned for whatever the future holds on this front.

Amazon

Perhaps the biggest reason Amazon (AMZN -1.07%) shares could quintuple their current value by 2030 is that shares are down a whopping 46% from last year's peak; simply recovering that loss would mean nearly a 100% gain on its present price. Nevertheless this company's backstory has far more potential than a mere recovery of the stock's recent setback.

This backstory is no longer about e-commerce however.

While selling stuff online remains its biggest business as measured by revenue it's not even close to being its biggest moneymaker. That honor belongs to its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services (AWS). Even prior to this year when soaring expenses dragged its e-commerce operation into the red its cloud computing division was driving roughly two-thirds of its operating income.

The company's cloud computing profitability profile hasn't really changed much since then. It's just grown. AWS' revenue through the first three quarters of this year is up 32% pulling its operating income up 33% with it. In light of Technavio's expectation for annualized growth of 19% for the cloud computing market through 2026 Amazon doesn't necessarily even need its e-commerce business's paper-thin profit margins to be restored to their pre-pandemic levels to continue growing its bottom line at a double-digit pace.

The kicker: Whether or not e-commerce itself is ever profitable again for Amazon may be irrelevant. Its advertising business fueled by the shopping site's traffic is a fast-growing profit center in and of itself. The company did a hefty $9.5 billion ad sales last quarter alone up 25% year over year. And it's still largely learning the advertising business.

AutoZone

Finally add AutoZone (AZO -0.26%) to your list of stocks that could turn $1000 today into $5000 by 2030.

Surprised? As unbelievable as it seems the auto parts and car-care business isn't just consistent but also high-growth. AutoZone's revenue growth of 11% for the fiscal year ending in August is both impressive and in line with the industry's long-term norms. The stock's performance is equally impressive. AutoZone shares are up 50% for the past five years despite their steep (and likely temporary) sell-off since the end of last year and are more than twice their value 10 years ago.

Those are solid numbers but hardly a quintupling. There's good reason to believe the next eight years could prove remarkably more fruitful for AutoZone than the past eight have been however. That's the sheer cost of a new car.

There was a time when consumers recognized that it made more sense to purchase a new automobile than continue spending more and more money just to keep an aging vehicle running. With Kelley Blue Book reporting that the average price for a new car sold in the United States rose to a near-record $48281 in October though the math of the matter changes.

It's once again making increasingly more sense to invest in the automobile you already own -- even more so when the economy is wobbling as it is now. Underscoring this argument is S&P Global's estimate that the average vehicle being driven on U.S. roads is a record-breaking 12.2 years old. While it's a testament to their quality and durability it also suggests they're highly fixable.

It all plays right into the hand AutoZone is holding of course particularly in light of the likelihood that car prices won't be meaningfully dropping anytime soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3JvYm90aWNzYW5kYXV0b21hdGlvbm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMDQvbW9uYXJjaC1sYXVuY2hlcy1maXJzdC1jb21tZXJjaWFsbHktYXZhaWxhYmxlLWF1dG9ub21vdXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtdHJhY3Rvci81ODQxOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Monarch launches 'first commercially available' autonomous electric tractor,"Monarch Tractor maker of the MK-V the fully electric driver-optional smart tractor says the first tractors are now coming off the Founder Series production line at its headquarters and manufacturing facility in Livermore California.

The rollout comes less than two years since Monarch unveiled its groundbreaking tractor that combines electrification automation and data analysis to help farmers reduce their carbon footprint improve field safety streamline farming operations and increase their bottom lines.

Constellation Brands the leading global premium fine wine and craft spirits producer and largest beer importer in the US has partnered with Monarch as its first customer through its purchase of the first six Founder Series MK-V tractors.

The delivery of MK-V tractors to Constellation Brands will be followed by additional customer shipments to family farms and other large multinational corporations.

Utilizing a Monarch MK-V in place of a comparable diesel tractor is the equivalent emission reduction of removing 14 passenger vehicles from the road.

Considering nearly 25 percent of global emissions result from agriculture the zero-emission Monarch Tractor will help make meaningful emissions reductions as the use of Monarch Tractors scale in an industry that has been historically difficult to decarbonize.

The use of the MK-V tractor simultaneously helps solve numerous challenges farmers face today including labor shortages safety concerns increased customer scrutiny for sustainable practices government regulations and more.

Monarch says the key features of the MK-V include:

Renewable Technology : The MK-V is 100 percent electric and has zero tailpipe emissions. It also serves as a 3-in-1 electrification tool operating as a tractor or utility vehicle during operation as well as a powerful electric generator in the field.

At approximately 5:40 p.m. on Wednesday officers with the Corning Police Department began investigating a loud banging noise that was coming from outside the police department on the 700 block of Fourth Street.

The suspect later identified as 32-year-old Cassidy Russ began ""fumbling with an item near the front of his waistband"" the police department said in a press release. As the officers gave the suspect verbal commands Russ lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it toward police. The Molotov cocktail missed the officer and exploded near a parked vehicle.

A Molotov cocktail is a homemade bomb made from a bottle filled with gasoline and stuffed with a piece of cloth that is lit just before the bottle is thrown.

Police say that Russ was observed by an officer walking away from the police department following the deployment of the bomb and onto Solano Street.

Authorities say officers pursued Russ after observing him near the department. An off duty officer tackled Russ on the 1300 block of Solano Street but Russ continued to resist arrest by concealing his hands by his waistband and backpack.

Officers used baton strikes and pain compliance techniques to subdue Russ who continued to resist arrest police said. Officers eventually took Russ into custody by placing him in handcuffs under sustained resistance.

According to the Corning Police Department this wasn't the first time Russ tossed a Molotov cocktail toward cops. Russ had an active arrest warrant for a previous incident in late July when he threw a Molotov cocktail near where the police department stages marked patrol cars.

And that may signal trouble for some local commercial real estate.

Bustling activity at the standalone restaurant is a surprise to some property executives because the building was supposed to be demolished by now to make way for a 27-story tower that would serve as the new corporate home of CBRE Group the world's largest commercial real estate brokerage by revenue. Multiple real estate sources have told CoStar News the proposed project at 2401 McKinney Ave. appears stalled amid rising interest rates and inflation.

The lack of progress is a rare hiccup for a metropolitan area that has been the national leader in luring companies that promise to invest millions of dollars and create thousands of jobs. Goldman Sachs for example is expected to employ at least 5000 workers at its new $500 million office campus in Uptown Dallas that is scheduled to break ground early next year.

""Right now to get something completed from start to finish you need a proven development team with a sophisticated lender with more equity than usual and it has to be a strong deal"" said Jack Matthews a developer experienced in working with the city of Dallas on projects and familiar with area development but not affiliated with the CBRE project. ""In the past other deals were getting done but I think it's going to be two to five years before we get back to those deals. There's a lot of uncertainty in the market right now.""

Construction was supposed to begin on CBRE's proposed 750000-square-foot office tower this past February according to a state permit. Not only has construction not begun but Truluck's is still taking reservations well into next year. At this rate the project might not meet the construction timeline spelled out in an incentive agreement between CBRE and the city of Dallas and that could imperil the brokerage's access to some public funds real estate professionals say.

The brokerage signed a formal agreement with the city of Dallas one year ago for the proposed tower helping the brokerage secure about $4 million in state and local economic incentives in exchange for meeting certain guidelines. Some of those guidelines include CBRE leasing at least 200000 square feet for its global headquarters at the new office tower that would be developed by Dallas-based Trammell Crow Co. CBRE's U.S. development arm.

The agreement specifies that the new tower must be constructed by the end of 2024 with CBRE taking occupancy no later than the end of 2025. With a little more than two years to complete a project that general contractors say would take 2 1/2 maybe even three years to develop real estate professionals say it seems unlikely CBRE will meet the construction milestones laid out in the incentive package.

CBRE declined to comment to CoStar News on the status of the project. A Trammell Crow spokeswoman also declined to comment. The city of Dallas has not received an update from CBRE on the project since the formal agreement was signed Dec. 1 2021 a city official told CoStar News.

Even so the deadline is still years away and there's no certainty that the firm won't either complete the project on time seek to negotiate changes to push back deadlines to qualify for the incentives or forgo the incentives if it should miss the deadline for construction.

Economic Shifts

A lot has changed in the past year since Dallas-based CBRE signed the agreement with construction costs escalating and upending capital markets leading the brokerage to take significant cost-cutting measures including laying off an unknown number of employees. The firm plans to cut $400 million of spending much of that tied to trimming its workforce by mid-2023.

CBRE's proposed new tower had an initial $200 million estimated cost at least at the time a state permit was filed in July 2021. Trammell Crow first started collecting construction bids for the project in August 2020 according to construction documents obtained by CoStar News at the time.

Trammell Crow told a neighborhood watchdog group in September 2020 it had the tower's financing in place. But fast forward more than two years later and those construction bids and financing are probably inadequate with what is required to develop the same skyscraper today because of increased construction materials and labor costs industry professionals say.

If the project is on hold it may be difficult for CBRE to move forward with its agreed-upon incentives with the city of Dallas said Larry Hamilton chairman and CEO of Hamilton Properties Corp. Hamilton who has worked through incentive agreements with the city on various projects but is not affiliated with the CBRE project said ""the city will require them to get an extension and go through a bunch of hoops. It won't be the simplest thing in the world to get the extension.""

The city of Dallas approved a $250000 economic incentive in exchange for CBRE building and leasing space at the new tower creating hundreds of jobs and forming internship programs with local colleges and universities. In addition CBRE was eligible to receive $3.45 million from the Texas Enterprise Fund to invest more than $29 million in its Dallas headquarters and create 460 new jobs. The deal which also included additional funds for CBRE to expand its operations center in Richardson Texas marked the first time the state's deal-closing fund offered economic incentives to a real estate brokerage.

The agreement with the state did not specify the address of where CBRE planned to invest in its Dallas headquarters. CBRE's headquarters has been at 2100 McKinney Ave. in Uptown Dallas since 2020 when it relocated its main corporate home from Los Angeles. The proposed development site of CBRE's new headquarters is located one block north of the brokerage's existing headquarters.

Uptown Dallas is one of the city's most sought-after neighborhoods for office space in proximity to luxury property such as The Ritz-Carlton hotel and residences and the occasional streetcar tooting its presence to pedestrians. CBRE rivals including JLL Cushman & Wakefield Newmark and Avison Young have offices in the walkable upscale neighborhood. McKinney Avenue is known for having the city's priciest office rents per square foot. Uptown has a vacancy rate of 15.6% slightly lower than the city's average of 17.4% according to CoStar data.

But Uptown faces headwinds as office tenants reevaluate leases because of work-from-home trends having an uncertain effect on future office demand. The uncertainty of the future of office space has likely played a role in slowing progress on CBRE's proposed new tower industry professionals say.

Lending Tightens

CBRE is expected to lease about 25% of the office space at the proposed new tower leaving about a half-million square feet without a tenant and on the balance sheet at a time when the company is scaling back. Lending has tightened since early September causing CBRE's sales and loan originations to fall sharply in the third quarter and cloud the brokerage's earnings. CBRE is planning to cut $300 million in costs related to reducing its headcount the company said in its third-quarter earnings report.

Other major new office projects are underway in Uptown including two being developed by Dallas-area developers. Granite Properties broke ground on 23Springs in June and Dallas-based Harwood International broke ground on Harwood No. 14 in 2021.

King White president and CEO of Dallas-based Site Selection Group said the uncertain economic climate hitting companies throughout the United States would probably give CBRE some traction in renegotiating its performance-driven economic incentive agreement with the city and state.

The agreement between the city of Dallas and CBRE has a force majeure clause an “act of God” provision that became a bigger part of real estate negotiations during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic a so-called act of God was typically tied to a war natural disaster or other uncontrollable circumstances to free landlords or tenants from being held liable to lease terms. It is not clear if the force majeure clause in CBRE's agreement in which the city is allowed to extend deadlines in certain circumstances could come into play possibly as a negotiating tactic with the brokerage's new headquarters.

White who isn't involved in CBRE's economic incentives said the firm wouldn't be the only company seeking to renegotiate its economic incentive agreement with shifts to remote work causing some issues with compliance with full-time employees often tied to working in a specific place or city in order to receive incentives.

For example the city of Plano a suburb north of Dallas redid its incentive agreement last year to accommodate for JPMorgan's remote work policy. JPMorgan received nearly $5 million in incentives from the city of Plano where it has a 1.5 million-plus-square-foot campus and 4500 employees in an agreement stemming from 2016.

In addition the rise in construction costs and tight labor conditions have also upended compliance of incentives agreed to years ago King said.

""The office sector is not very stable right now with financing being difficult to secure"" King added. ""We are expecting interest rates to remain high and continue to escalate for another year at least.""

Meanwhile the food keeps coming at Truluck's in the 14063-square-foot site on McKinney Avenue where it has operated since 2015. Truluck's was expected to anchor the ground-floor retail portion of CBRE's new office tower once built. An executive for the corporate chain declined to comment on the proposed new tower or if the restaurant has plans to move to an interim location during construction.

""We have no comment at this time out of respect for"" the 75 employees who work at the McKinney Avenue location said Riley Hutton director of hospitality and managing partner of Truluck's. ""We still have a very successful operation that we need to protect and this location has no shutdown date.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3N0YXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMzczMDczMzg3L3NlY3VyaXR5LWdpYW50LXNsYW1zLWRlbnZlci1vZmZpY2UtbWFya2V0LXdpdGgtb25lLW9mLXRoZS1sYXJnZXN0LXN1YmxldC1saXN0aW5ncy1vZi10aGUteWVhctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Security Giant Slams Denver Office Market With One of the Largest Sublet Listings of the Year,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3N0YXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMzczMDczMzg3L3NlY3VyaXR5LWdpYW50LXNsYW1zLWRlbnZlci1vZmZpY2UtbWFya2V0LXdpdGgtb25lLW9mLXRoZS1sYXJnZXN0LXN1YmxldC1saXN0aW5ncy1vZi10aGUteWVhctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C491C48E80>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

COST,Costco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZG5ldC5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtd2FpdC1pcy1vdmVyLWFzLWNvc3Rjby1vcGVucy1pbi1sYWtlLXN0ZXZlbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The wait is over as Costco opens in Lake Stevens | HeraldNet.com,"The new store in the works since 2018 opened Friday. Some came for the specials others had a hankering for hot dogs.

LAKE STEVENS — Some things defy all known boundaries. They fly in the face of time constraints social constructs and sometimes good reason.

Costco hot dogs it seems are one of those things.

The very first customer Friday at the new Costco in Lake Stevens had a clear mission for his visit and that was a hot dog from the food court said Michael Estrada a stocker at the store.

No matter that it was 8 a.m. or that the gentleman had to jostle among 200 other people gathered in the blowing snow and sub-freezing weather waiting for the warehouse to open its doors. He had his priorities in line.

Friday’s opening culminated years of planning uncertainty and controversy. The Issaquah-based wholesale giant first announced plans for the new location at 9210 24th St. SE in 2018 and got its first permits in 2019.

The project was delayed for years by several petitions and lawsuits from Livable Lake Stevens a local group opposing the development’s potential environmental impacts and traffic disruptions. Tentative opening dates were pushed back several times as construction neared completion most recently from Nov. 23 to the final date of Dec. 2.

But once the company surmounted its legal obstacles construction got underway quickly said store manager Chris Delong. The site went from nearly empty lot to massive warehouse complete with 30 gas pumps outside in a little under four months he said. On the day of the grand opening builders had wrapped up finishing touches only nine days before.

Those gas pumps got turned on Monday night according to fans in the store’s dedicated Facebook group. Friday morning group members posted pictures of themselves waiting outside the hallowed doors as early as 6:30 a.m.

Estrada who said he’d been hired at the location three weeks before the opening said the morning hadn’t been as crazy as he expected. He said the days and hours before the ribbon-cutting ceremony had been quite the scramble making sure every last detail was perfect for the highly anticipated event.

Jill Raub said she’d been holding off on grocery shopping since before Thanksgiving in anticipation of stocking up on the first day. Raub’s cart was piled to the top with frozen goods and Christmas gifts and she said she was contemplating grabbing another cart for the overflow.

“I live in Lake Stevens and I’ve been excited for this store to open for what feels like forever now” Raub said. “It’s so nice to have it so close and we don’t have to drive to Everett anymore.”

Some customers beelined for opening-day specials like discounted e-bikes. Others eyeballed a 6-liter bottle of French Bordeaux costing a cool $1800. Most stuck to the classics nabbing bargains in the meat department and stocking up on toilet paper. And of course the food court was hopping.

Despite the air of excitement the store was surprisingly uncrowded in its first couple of hours. The warehouse will open at 10 a.m. going forward but those dedicated enough to line up Friday morning got a couple of hours to peruse in relative peace.

Delong said he only expected traffic to increase steadily through the end of the day and thought things would really get crazy in the afternoon and evening when people left work.

Ryan Jordan a buyer visiting the location from Costco’s corporate office said the company strives to make every trip to their stores “an experience not just a shopping trip” and he felt the first hours of Lake Stevens’ new store lived up to those expectations.

“It’s kind of our chance to give Lake Stevens a good first impression” Jordan said. “We think we’ve gotten a pretty warm welcome so far.”

Camarillo residents who drive to Oxnard Simi Valley or Westlake Village to shop at Costco may soon have a shorter trip city officials announced Tuesday.

The retail membership warehouse club submitted an application to build a store as well as a gas station on a vacant lot at the west end of the Camarillo Town Center city officials said.

“The economic development potential Costco brings to Camarillo is phenomenal” City Manager Greg Ramirez said in a statement. “We are proud of the work and excellent customer service our staff provides to the business and development community that make deals like this possible.”

The proposed 160000-square-foot building will be next to Home Depot 401 W. Ventura Blvd.

Michelle Glueckert D’Anna assistant to the city manager told the Acorn that Costco and the city are not concerned that there could be a lack of demand for an additional location despite there being a Costco about 5 miles north of the proposed site.

Costco representatives conducted demographic studies and found that a Camarillo store would be beneficial because of the large number of residents who have bought memberships according to a news release.

City staff said Costco would be an ideal business for Camarillo especially considering the potential revenue the city loses when residents shop at other locations.

Over the past year an estimated 37000 Camarillo residents visited the Oxnard store 13000 visited the Westlake Village store and 6000 visited the Simi Valley store according to the city.

A Costco in Camarillo Ramirez said would improve the city’s sales tax revenues.

“This development is estimated to quickly become one of the top 10 sales tax generators for the city” he said.

The applicant and property owner are negotiating the purchase and the project is not guaranteed city officials said. Costco hopes to open the Camarillo store in mid-to-late 2024.

A Costco spokesperson declined to comment until the project is complete.

The result of a 1993 merger between Costco and Price Club the retail giant has more than 800 stores throughout the world. Its first location was in California. Price Club’s first store a converted airplane hangar opened in San Diego in 1976 and at the time served only businesses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdXByb3h4LmNvbS9saWZlL2Nvc3Rjby10ZXF1aWxhLXZzLWNsYXNzaWMtYW5lam8tdGVxdWlsYS1ibGluZC10YXN0ZS10ZXN0LWJhdHRsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Tequila Añejo vs. Classic Tequila Añejo -- Blind Test,"Part 1: The Tasting Taste 1 Tasting Notes: The nose on this one opens with a layer of dark chocolate spiked with black pepper and a touch of nuttiness before the roasted agave kicks in. The palate has a soft vanilla impression next to raisins and more of that pepper a touch of cinnamon and burnt chocolate-covered coffee beans. The end has a bit more of that roasted agave next to white pepper with a semi-watery finish. This starts strong but ends a little weak.

Taste 2 Tasting Notes: There’s a clear tannic note on the nose that leads toward a hint of burnt cacao nibs that are almost smoldering next to bold white pepper powder and a hint of sour crema. The palate has a sense of deeply roasted agave next to woody cinnamon sticks allspice and clove with a burst of burnt orange and singed vanilla pods. The end is soft and sweet with caramel and vanilla qualities leading back to spicy barks and wood tannins. This was pretty nice with a solid beginning middle and end. The end was a tad sweet but not overly so. Taste 3 Tasting Notes: This opens with a rush of deeply roasted agave with caramelized sugars over stewed plums brandy-soaked raisins and tobacco leaves dipped in salted dark chocolate cut with pink peppercorns and dried chili pepper. The palate has a deep and dark burnt orange spiked with clove and salted black licorice next to softer notes of stewed apricot and marmalade with a hint of brandy butter. The end sweetens lightly toward agave rock candy and sharp Tellicherry black pepper. This is pretty delicious.

Taste 4 Tasting Notes: The nose opens with a bourbon aura of caramel and vanilla with a touch of cherry bark singed marshmallow and woody winter spices with a layer of roasted agave underneath. The palate has a cherry rock candy sweetness with a hint of winter spice cake full of dates and cinnamon with a touch of nutmeg and candied citrus. The end is fruity and spicy with a rich roasted agave base. This was fine. It did feel like it was made for an American whiskey palate more than a classic tequila one though. Still it was pretty tasty. Taste 5 Tasting Notes: The nose has a nice balance of roasted agave with a hint of caramelization next to woody cinnamon bark with a touch of mild chocolate and coffee lurking in the background if you really dig deep. The palate is pretty light with hints of choco-chili tobacco and white pepper powder next to a whisper of mango skins and rock candy. The end has a note of sweet agave candy and cracked peppercorns with a semi-watery finish. This was fine as well. It feels a bit standard and really sweet.

Taste 6 Tasting Notes: There’s a rich roasted agave and smoldering spice bark aura on the nose with a hint of butterscotch sweetness and vanilla smoothness. The palate has a slight nuttiness that leans into chocolate nut clusters with a shot of espresso on the side and a touch of vanilla just kissed with cinnamon and clove. The end has a mild almost musty oakiness with a rich salted caramel sweetness countered by bold white pepper and roasted agave. This was pretty okay overall. Taste 7 Tasting Notes: This is earthy on the nose with a hint of garden-center potting soil next to butterscotch sour red wine spiked with winter spices and old vanilla pods. The palate has a sense of cinnamon and clove with a toffee sweetness and a touch of peach and vanilla cake. The end holds onto the dirty earthiness with a sense of whole peppercorns caramelized agave and charred cinnamon bark. The was a little funky but fine otherwise.

Taste 8 Tasting Notes: The nose opens with a medley of burnt orange rinds chocolate-covered espresso beans dusted with salt and cinnamon and a sense of roasted agave with a peppery base. The palate leans into the woodiness of the cinnamon with a hint of anise marmalade and white pepper. The end is a little watery but delivers a caramel and agave vibe next to smoldering cinnamon and burnt sugars. This was perfectly fine but didn’t jump out at me. Taste 9 Tasting Notes: There’s a sense of supple agave on the nose with a caramelization that leads to salted black licorice and dark chocolate with a mix of smoldering woody spice and fine white pepper powder with a whisper of sour cream. The palate has a deeply roasted agave flavor note that leads to smoked oysters and smoked apricots with a sense of mineral-forward sea salt a dash more of those burnt spices and rich toffee. The end leans further into the smoked nature with a dash of charred orchard wood and oyster shells over caramelized tropical fruits and agave with a white pepper sharpness. This is by far the most complex tequila on the panel and pretty damn tasty.

Part 2: The Ranking 9. El Sativo Single Estate Añejo — Taste 1 ABV: 40% Average Price: $54 The Tequila: This tequila is a “single estate” product meaning all the Weber agave comes from the farm around the distillery. The agave is roasted in brick ovens and then crushed with a roller mill to extract the sugary juices. After fermentation the juice is twice distilled and then filled into ex-bourbon barrels for a 16-month rest. Finally those barrels are vatted proofed down and bottled. Bottom Line: This tequila just never lands for me. There’s nothing really at fault here besides that it’s the thinnest flavor profile on this list. It just has a somewhat gaunt vibe.

8. Kirkland Signature Tequila Añejo — Taste 5 ABV: 40% Average Price: $32 (1-liter bottle) The Tequila: This is pretty standard tequila from a process POV. Blue Weber agave autoclave and roller mill extraction. The juice is twice distilled but in this case in a stainless steel pot still. There are additives involved but it’s unclear how so. Bottom Line: This was a bit overly sweet but still delivered a standard roasted agave body. Still this was pretty subpar. 7. Hornitos Black Barrel Añejo — Taste 2 ABV: 40% Average Price: $32 The Tequila: This is classic Hornitos Añejo that’s finished in heavily-charred oak barrels for another four-month rest before batching proofing and bottling. Bottom Line: This had a decent vibe but was a little tannic which subtracted from the overall body of the sip. This is definitely a mixing tequila.

6. Casamigos Añejo — Taste 4 ABV: 40% Average Price: $61 The Tequila: Famously known as George Clooney’s billion-dollar tequila brand Casamigos delivers the goods. The piñas are slow-roasted in brick ovens. The juice is then fermented for nearly four days allowing the flavors to run deep in the juice. Finally the tequila is aged for 14 months — resting through the hot highland days and cool nights. Bottom Line: Again this was fine. It felt a little bourbon-forward which made it feel more like something I’d mix with than sip neat. 5. Casa Noble Añejo — Taste 7 ABV: 40% Average Price: $68 The Tequila: This classic tequila — made with Blue Weber — is all about the slow aging process. The tequila is barreled in new French oak barrels for two long years before vatting proofing and bottling. Bottom Line: This had an interesting funkiness that didn’t really go anywhere interesting on the finish.

4. Cazadores Añejo — Taste 8 ABV: 40% Average Price: $40 The Tequila: This version of Cazadores is made with classic Blue Weber agave of course. The hot juice is aged for 12 months in small-format new American oak casks. Once those hit just the right spot they’re batched and the tequila is proofed and bottled. Bottom Line: This was a pretty standard but well-made añejo. I can see mixing a tequila old fashioned with this one. 3. Gran Coramino Añejo — Taste 6 ABV: 40% Average Price: $113 The Tequila: Kevin Hart’s new tequila is a collaboration with an 11th-generation tequila maker Juan Domingo Beckmann. The agaves are roasted in traditional stone ovens and the juices are open-fermented. After double distilling the tequila mellows in American and French oak for 12 months. Lastly the tequila is batched and re-barreled into old cognac casks for a final rest before proofing and bottling. Bottom Line: This was nice all things considered. It felt like an easy sipper that’d also make one hell of a cocktail.

2. Lobos 1707 Extra Añejo — Taste 3 ABV: 40% Average Price: $176 The Tequila: This tequila spends three years resting in American oak from the jump. Those barrels are then batched and re-barreled into Pedro Ximénez sherry casks using the solera method (never really emptying the casks before new juice goes in). Finally those barrels are batched proofed and bottled. Bottom Line: This was pretty delicious overall. It had a great body with clear and concise flavor notes that told a story from start to finish.

Their añejo tequila was vatted and then re-barreled into used Laphroaig barrels from Islay Scotland for a final maturation. Then those barrels were batched and the tequila was proofed and bottled.

It also provided a warm hug to its fans on Wall Street producing stellar results from sizable same-store sales increases to its stock price which got the best of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index. Not to mention its sales of $222.7 billion in the fiscal year ended October up a whopping 16 percent.

For that and more—including Costco's continued status as one of the nation's best employers—we named the Issaquah Washington–based warehouse behemoth our 2022 Company of the Year.

If there were one company that could say rising prices weren't a negative it was Costco. The Great Inflationary Outbreak of 2022 placed Costco's 842 worldwide stores squarely under the spotlight offering up yet another opportunity for the 39-year-old retailer to showcase to investors and members its low-price leadership chops.

Consider Cephas Sund from Los Angeles California. The Costco cardholder who loves organic products says he shopped at conventional grocery stores prior to 2022 but skyrocketing prices put a hard stop on many of those excursions. ""When organic produce at the grocery stores is almost double what it cost at Costco you (can) see where the savings quickly added up"" Sund said.

Sund and other customers we talked to said pretty much the same thing: Costco is a trusted retailer who had their backs throughout a challenging economic year. (That ought to tell you something.)

How? As the cost of items like toothpaste and eggs soared Costco in most cases was the last to raise prices at its cavernous 146000-square-foot stores explained Jefferies retail analyst Corey Tarlowe. ""The company is very strict on price and I think that is evident through its steadfast commitment to its $1.50 hot dog and soda combo competitive gas prices and $4.99 rotisserie chickens"" Tarlowe explained.

Case in point: As gas prices spiked to more than $5.00 a gallon in the summer Costco saw lines at its hundreds of U.S. gas stations stretch out onto highways. Why? The company stayed true to its DNA as a wholesaler and kept gas prices at the lowest levels in town. Tarlowe says Costco's gas prices have typically been $0.25-$1.00 a gallon cheaper than the next closest competitor. (GasBuddy a fuel station app said Costco was the cheapest fuel station nationwide for the fifth year in a row. )

Elizabeth Dragomir had to stand in a line of vehicles waiting for gas at Costco after a cyberattack crippled the biggest fuel pipeline in the country run by Colonial Pipeline. Dragomir's car ran out of gas in the parking lot in Norfolk Virginia U.S. May 11 2021. REUTERS/Jay Paul (Jay Paul / reuters)

Costco held the line in other ways too.

As Walmart-owned Sam's Club jacked up membership prices by $5-$10 in September Costco held firm. Execs said it wasn't the right time to tax consumers dealing with runaway inflation. (Sam's did undercut Costco's hot dog/drink combo by 12 cents. You can't win them all.)

All of those warm embraces of customers was just Costco being Costco long-time CEO Craig Jelinek told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview inside a new club opening in Lake Stevens Washington.

""I think first of all we've been very fortunate. We've got great employees and every company is only as good as everybody around them"" said Jelinek who has been with the company since nearly the time of its founding in 1984 by Jeffrey Brotman and Jim Sinegal. ""We've persevered and we're very pleased that we've been able to get merchandise and continue to create value for our members and grow our membership base and drive sales.""

This isn't a surprise to the retailer's long-time followers on Wall Street.

Goldman Sachs' Kate McShane for instance has covered Costco for years. The company's focus on low prices and stellar operational execution is etched in the fabric of the retailer and has served the company well for years in good times and bad she explained. The ""get it done"" mindset harkens back to the company's co-founders Jim Sinegal and Jeffrey Brotman who created a no frills atmosphere that put the member at the center.

""They're definitely one of the best run best-in-class retailers"" McShane said. ""We've not necessarily been that surprised Costco has been gaining market share as a result of some of the macroeconomic dynamics.""

Experts like McShane believe Costco has gained market share notably in food throughout the pandemic primarily from selling high quality private label products under its popular Kirkland Signature brand.

Here are some Company of the Year worthy (and Wall Street-pleasing) highlights from the past year:

Costco's same-store sales have out-performed conventional competitors

Costco's U.S. same-store sales for the nine-weeks ended October 30 increased by 10%. By comparison third-quarter same-store sales for discounters Walmart (WMT) U.S. and Target (TGT) rose by a far slower 8.2% and 2.7% respectively. Stacked up against its pure play warehouse rivals Costco's recent sales growth trends are more in line. East Coast warehouse club rival BJ's Wholesale (BJ) saw third-quarter same-store sales increase by 9.7%. Same-store sales at Walmart's Sam's Club increased 10% in the third quarter. But given that Costco is much bigger than the likes of Sam's which has sales of about $59 billion those same-store sales figures are impressive.

Costco had a bang-up year within its key operating metrics

For the fiscal year-ended Aug. 28 Costco posted a 14.4% overall same-store sales increase; a 93% renewal rate for U.S. members; the addition of 7.3 million members; and a slight increase in net profit margins (a win in the hyper inflationary environment). Meanwhile total cash clocked in at $11.1 billion representing a hearty 34% of current assets.

Despite 12-months of rock solid financial performance the stock is down 13% this year as of Dec. 2 but that still beats the S&P 500 by a couple percentage points. Not bad in a year where bear markets reigned supreme.

""We're really the extreme value proposition"" Costco's 30-plus year CFO Richard Galanti told Yahoo Finance of the warehouse chain's financial success in a year of of eye-popping inflation.

But like any other retailer there are always uncertainties lurking.

Analysts contend Costco's often relatively ""expensive"" price-to-earnings multiple — reflective of its years of steady and strong financials — requires the company to be perfect operationally at every turn.

""The valuation on Costco I can I can tell you does give some people some angst because they are at such a big premium to the market. They're at such a big premium to Walmart and other big box retailers that some people don't totally understand why or they can't really bridge the gap between them"" Goldman's McShane said.

Costco didn't have a perfect November as same-store sales growth cooled versus October the company reported on Nov. 30. Investors promptly punished the often teflon stock on the view 2023 would bring further sales slowdowns.

Another wild card for 2023 is membership fees. Costco could raise them after years of holding the line much to the disappointment of Wall Street. That would of course increase revenues and profits but could also turn off some loyal still inflation-weary customers.

Costco's last membership fee increase kicked in on June 1 2017. The warehouse club took its Gold Star membership (the entry level Costco membership) fee up $5 to $60 and executive membership (offers 2% rewards on qualified purchases and other perks) fees increased by $10 to $120.

""You're likely to hear something about this in the next (earnings) call in maybe six to 12 months I think and it'll probably be pretty likely that we'll hear something about it at least upcoming on the next earnings call"" said Jefferies analyst Tarlowe. He estimates that a membership fee increase could boost Costco's earnings growth by a ""mid-single digit percentage"" rate. A Costco bull he doesn't believe such a hike is priced into the retailer's already relatively expensive stock.

Costco's CFO Galanti said the retailer isn't ready to raise the cost of its membership but it will be something it clearly outlines to Wall Street when and if the time comes. Growth will also be driven by opening 20 to 25 new warehouses a year and the existing business drivers Galanti added.

In the meantime Jelinek is paying careful attention to consumer spending this holiday season amid the mixed economic backdrop. Jelinek says he is pleased with the trends in the business to kick off the holiday shopping season but does see a few warning flags that amount to uncertainties headed into 2023.

""You know a little bit. A little bit"" Jelinek replied when asked if he sees a recession forming in the U.S. ""Our jewelry business has slowed down. If you look at the really high-end television sets they've slowed down. I think right now people are very very value conscious. They're always value conscious but I think more so now than ever.""

Obsessed with the $1.50 hot dog/soda combo at Costco like Brian Sozzi (left)? You can thank Costco CEO Craig Jelinek (right) for not raising the price of the combo despite sky-high inflation. (Kevin Burke)

What the 70-year-old Jelinek may see forming however is a well-deserved retirement sometime within the next couple of years. In February Costco promoted Ron Vachris to president and COO. He also joined Jelinek and Galanti on Costco's board of directors.

Vachris 56 has similar merchant DNA to Jelinek and Costco's founders. He began his retail career at the age of 16 at Price Club which merged with Costco in 1993. Yahoo Finance briefly chatted with Vachris inside the Washington store opening — he was in true merchant form walking aisles and chatting with members.

Jelinek played any potential retirement announcement close to the vest.

""Let's put it this way. He's [Ron] president. And we'll let it go at that"" Jelinek said when asked about succession adding he plans to be CEO ""for a while.""

Costco's faithful members and employees surely would be OK with that timeline.

St Edward’s Crown the historic centrepiece of the Crown Jewels has been removed from the Tower of London to allow for modification work to begin ahead of the Coronation on Saturday 6th May 2023.

As per tradition The King will be crowned with St Edward's Crown during the Coronation Service at Westminster Abbey.

The King will also wear the Imperial State Crown during the Service.

St Edward's Crown is the crown historically used at the moment of Coronation and worn by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth at her Coronation in 1953. It was made for Charles II in 1661 as a replacement for the medieval crown which had been melted down in 1649. The original was thought to date back to the eleventh-century royal saint Edward the Confessor – the last Anglo-Saxon king of England.

The crown was commissioned from the Royal Goldsmith Robert Vyner in 1661. Although it is not an exact replica of the medieval design it follows the original in having four crosses-pattée and four fleurs-de-lis and two arches. It is made up of a solid gold frame set with rubies amethysts sapphires garnet topazes and tourmalines. The crown has a velvet cap with an ermine band.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJ1bmV3aXJlZC5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wNC9ob3ctbWFueS1jZWxsLXRvd2Vycy1hcmUtdGhlcmUtaW4tdGhlLXdvcmxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Many Cell Towers Are There In The World?,"The top 100 cellular tower companies in the world control and manage over 1.5 million buildings that house shared telecommunications infrastructure.

Then we delve further into the portfolios of each of the top 25 cell tower firms including the geographic distribution of their sites the number of tenants that install equipment on their towers and their primary clients. Please take note that this list does not include tower owners or operators from China or Russia.

A Cell Tower: What is it?

In order to enable the use of wireless communication devices like telephones and radios in the surrounding region electric communications equipment and antennae are put atop cell towers sometimes referred to as cell sites.

When a wireless carrier or tower firm expands the capacity or network coverage in a region they frequently build cell towers to improve signal reception. The United States is essentially covered in cell towers however certain cities have more than others. Since the late 1990s Millman Land has made sure that all of the cell towers have been thoroughly examined.

Currently the United States has more than 307000 cell towers. They occasionally appear on building roofs. Other times cities demand that cell towers perfectly fit into the urban environment. Sometimes they are concealed as trees in treescapes in rural places.

Cell tower audits surveys and as-builts are all part of our wireless services. We hope to educate you on cell towers and how they operate in this article. We also want to dispel the falsehoods and respond to people’s growing concerns about 5G.

How Do Cellular Towers Operate?

In the US there are more than 300 million daily cell phone users. When a mobile phone is in operation it emits an electromagnetic radio wave also known as a radio frequency which is picked up by the antenna of the closest cell tower.

This signal will be picked up by the cell tower which will then send it to a switching hub. This enables the call to connect to a phone network or to a different mobile phone. To assume that all of this occurs in a matter of seconds is absurd.

Cell tower components

Cell tower technology is incredibly quick thanks to its components. In this section we’ll talk a lot about cell carriers. This is so that several of a cell tower’s components also known as wireless networks or individual cell carriers can be used.

The best coverage for wireless networks in the US is provided by four different networks. Verizon is now the leading provider with a 70% 4G coverage rate. With 68% AT&T comes in second place. A significant reduction in coverage is seen between T-62% Mobile’s and Spring’s 27% in fourth place.

What Affects the Range of a Cell Tower?

A cell tower’s reach is not a set distance. That’s due to the number of different factors that might affect how far a cell tower can connect to a mobile device. The most typical variables are:

How high the antenna is in relation to the surroundings.

the signal’s frequency at use.

the transmitter’s rated power.

the site’s antenna array’s directional properties.

Radio waves are absorbed and reflected by the surrounding vegetation and buildings.

Weather conditions and regional geographic or regulatory variables.

High population densities are common places for the construction of the towers. This is so because there are the most prospective cell phone customers in these cities. Cell towers frequently “overlap” in highly populated regions as a result. By doing so interference issues are reduced.

If you’re wondering why you can’t get a signal on your cell phone it may be because you’re too distant from a tower or because hills big buildings or other structures have interfered with the signal. If many individuals are attempting to use the cell tower at once you can also lose your signal. That frequently results in dropped calls.

More and more cell towers will appear across the United States as technology develops. However there are still over 307000 cell towers across the country that make sure we have cell phone coverage practically wherever we go as we wait for 5G technology. The technology used to build these towers is amazing.

The Millman National Land Service makes sure that these cell towers not only adhere to health and safety regulations but also function as planned.

People in developed countries tend to take infrastructure for granted because they've grown up in countries and cities which have top infrastructure be it railroads roads bridges tunnels or even telecom. However only a small privileged percentage of the total global population enjoys this kind of security with most developing nations struggling to build even basic durable infrastructure which is also intrinsic to the success of any nation's economy.

The railroad in the U.S. is integral to continuing operations in the country and a shutdown would cause billions of dollars' worth of damage. All four of the major railroads in the country three of which are in our list of the top infrastructure companies in US reported some form of records profits in the previous year.

There are several issues which have governed the current railroad crisis which is threatening to spiral out of control. Railroad workers are governed under the Railway Labor Act which imposes restrictions on when unions can strike as opposed to most other unions in the country which are under no such obligation. Because of a breakdown in negotiations where railway management and the unions couldn't agree on a new deal President Biden ordered the unions to not go on strike and instead engage in a 60-day cooling off period as both sides would present proposals to the President in order to reach a better deal. At the forefront of this issue is sick leaves.

On the 1st of December 2022 the Senate rejected a proposal which would give railroad workers seven days of paid sick leaves. Immediately after President Biden signed a bill which would prevent the railroad workers from striking as that would devastate the country's economy.

The top infrastructure companies in the U.S. are giants of the industry providing employment to hundreds of thousands of people while recording hundreds of billions in revenue in total. To determine these companies we have considered their market cap revenue profit and assets assigning 30% weightage to the first three criteria and 10% to the last one.

Image: Channel 7/Getty

A number of commentators have questioned why Pat Cummins stayed on the field on the final day of Australia's victory over the West Indies in the first Test when he was clearly struggling with a calf complaint. The Aussie skipper didn't bowl on day five on Sunday but remained out in the field as Australia secured a 164-run win to retain the Frank Worrell trophy.

There were concerning scenes with the second Test starting on Thursday as Cummins didn't break into anything more than a leisurely jog while chasing a number of balls to the boundary. He then had to bend down sharply to prevent one ball from reaching the rope.

'SCARED MYSELF': Ricky Ponting speaks out after health incident

“I don’t think he’s guaranteed to play in Adelaide” Brendan Julian said during commentary for Fox Sports. “Why risk him out there in the field then? If he’s not going to bowl why risk him?

“If he’s a bit ginger then I don’t understand why he’s got to be in the field then. I wouldn’t be risking it.”

Mark Waugh also said it was “a bit strange” to see considering the second Test is just four days away. The Aussies will travel to Adelaide on Monday for the day-night Test and are considering having at least two fresh bowlers join them there.

Speaking after the match Cummins insisted he would be right and there was no cause for concern. ""I was pain free"" he said. ""Luckily we were in a good position so we could take the liberties (of not bowling).""

Cummins admitted Australia's long summer ahead with one more Test against the Windies before three against South Africa and a tour of India in February will come into the equation when it is decided if he played in Adelaide. ""It was definitely the thought process the last couple of days"" Cummins said.

""I don't really want to turn a one week injury into a three or four-week injury and you potentially miss the summer. So we'll weigh all that up. But I felt pretty comfortable out there. Give it a few days. It already feels pretty good. Our physio might be less optimistic but I think I'll be fine. I'm sure I'll have running and a bit of bowling to make sure I'm right.""

Steve Smith took over the captaincy duties when Cummins was off the filed for brief periods in the first Test. He would seemingly be in line to take the reins if Cummins misses out in Adelaide.

""I guess (normally) I'll have a similar prep to Josh (Hazlewood) and (Mitchell) Starc which would be maybe a light bowl the day before"" Cummins said. ""Now might be a bit different. Got to probably prove myself - have at least one bowl.

""Every Test match is always slightly different prep. I'm not too bothered. Hopefully I pass the fitness test and I'm good to go.""

If you're going off his movements (or lack of) in the field today you'd have Pat Cummins at fairly long odds to play the second test in Adelaide. Would be a blow for S.A cricket lovers missing out on the Australian captain for a second straight year. — Nathan Watson (@N_Watson_) December 4 2022

Why is @patcummins30 on the ground. It's clear he is injured and can't really field. Being captain means he should put the team first and get a fit fielder on the ground #AUSvWI #cricket #foxcricket — Mitch Messer (@mitchmess) December 4 2022

Nathan Lyon makes history as Aussies thrash Windies

Meanwhile Nathan Lyon has become Test cricket's second-most prolific off-spinner behind Muttiah Muralitharan after claiming six wickets on the final day in Perth. Lyon's fourth-innings figures of 6-128 helped Australia bowl the tourists out for 333 in pursuit of 498 for victory.

Travis Head also claimed two wickets in the victory including ending an 82-run seventh-wicket stand that had frustrated Australia when he bowled Alzarri Joseph for 43. Lyon then had Roston Chase (55) caught in the deep and bowled No.11 Kemar Roach next ball to cap his heroics.

The six-wicket haul took him past Ravichandran Ashwin (442 wickets) and into eighth position among Test wicket-takers overall with 446. Only Sri Lankan legend Muralitharan sits above the pair as the most successful off-spinner in the game with an untouchable 800 wickets to his name.

""He's got plenty of different tricks now"" Cummins said of Lyon. ""You saw him bowl over the wicket around the wicket a lot.

""You felt like he could beat (the batsmen) on the outside of the bat bring bat pad into play. He just feels like he's got a few different ways he can get a batter out and he's happier to chop and change between them as opposed to earlier in his career.""

A devastating six-wicket performance from Nathan Lyon helped the hosts to a 164-run victory at Optus Stadium despite a defiant half-century in defeat from Roston Chase.

Cummins elected not to bowl in the final innings after suffering a minor quad strain earlier in the Test however sparking fears he may have to sit out their next match in Adelaide starting on Thursday.

But the captain thinks he will be able to play and discussed how he will measure his workload ahead of the game plus a subsequent red-ball series with South Africa.

""I felt okay"" he said. ""It was more not trying to run as opposed to being restricted to run. If it got a bit tighter I was going to have a bowl but [I'm] pretty happy I managed not to to give myself a good chance.

""It's just a small strain. If you bowl you make it worse and can make [recovery] longer. I'll spend the next few days rehabbing getting it right and I think it's a pretty good chance I'll be good for Adelaide.

""We've got five Tests and I want to make sure I'm available for all five. It's always like that. But a lot of the Test matches you leave with absolutely nothing left in the tank.""

With four more matches to come this month though Cummins said he would leave the call in the hands of Australia's medical staff and selectors amid a series of short turnarounds.

""You don't really want to turn a one-week injury into a three or four-week injury and potentially miss the summer"" he added. ""So we'll weigh all that up.

""As I said I felt pretty comfortable out there. The physio might be less optimistic but I think I'll be fine. I'm sure I'll have running and a bit of bowling to make sure I'm right.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc3RvcnkvYXVzLXZzLXdpLTIwMjItMjMtMXN0LXRlc3QtY29uY2VybnMtb3Zlci1wYXQtY3VtbWlucy1hcy1zdGV2ZS1zbWl0aC10YWtlcy10aGUtcmVpbnMtMTM0NzkxMdIBiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuY3JpY2luZm8uY29tL3N0b3J5L2F1cy12cy13aS0yMDIyLTIzLTFzdC10ZXN0LWNvbmNlcm5zLW92ZXItcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtYXMtc3RldmUtc21pdGgtdGFrZXMtdGhlLXJlaW5zLTEzNDc5MTE_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Concerns over Cummins as Smith takes the reins,"Australia's captain returned to the field in the evening session and could still bowl on the final day

There are concerns over the fitness of Australia captain Pat Cummins after he failed to take the field for the start of the fourth innings on day four of the first Test against West Indies in Perth due to right quadricep soreness.

Cummins bowled 20.2 overs in West Indies first innings across days two and three to claim figures of 3 for 34 including his 200th Test scalp

But when Australia declared at lunch on day four following Marnus Labuschagne 's second century of the match Cummins failed to take the field after lunch.

""Pat Cummins is experiencing some mild right-sided quadriceps soreness"" a CA spokesperson said. ""He will continue to be monitored by team medical staff and his availability to bowl in the second innings will be assessed on an ongoing basis. Steve Smith will captain the side while Cummins is off the field.""

Cummins returned to the field after 36 overs off halfway through the last session of day four with Australia coach Andrew McDonald explaining that he could be available to bowl on the final day.

""Clearly he has to wait his time now he'll have to do that on the field until he's able to bowl again"" McDonald told Fox Cricket. ""[He'll bowl] probably sometime tomorrow. We'll try to line that up with the second new ball. We're sort of managing and respecting the fact that he has a quad complaint. Clearly the game at the moment his bowling would be valuable out there so we're going to get him out there and assess him at the end of the day.

""It's only a minor niggle. We can manage it. Clearly we've got a long summer ahead but this game is most important.""

Australia's selectors did have a loose plan in place as to how they would manage their fast bowlers across five back-to-back Tests this summer with a massive Test workload ahead in 2023 including tours of India and England.

The resting of some individuals is a possibility. The selectors' management plan was entirely dependent on how much Australia's quicks would bowl and the types of surfaces they would bowl on with only a four-day break between the Perth and Adelaide Tests against West Indies before breaks of just five four and four days ahead of each of the three Tests against South Africa.

Scott Boland  who currently averages 9.55 in Test cricket is the reserve quick in the squad while Michael Neser and Mark Steketee are likely the next in line. Cummins missed last year's Adelaide Test against England after being a Covid close contact on the eve of the game. Jhye Richardson played on that occasion but won't be considered this season due to various injury niggles.

""It's a short turnaround [to Adelaide] and that's clearly in our decision-making as well"" McDonald said. ""Ideally if Pat doesn't have to bowl again in this Test match that's great but at the moment the West Indies are playing really really well so we'll be put to a decision early tomorrow.""

Meanwhile West Indies have suffered an injury of their own with Kemar Roach limping off the field following his seventh over Australia's second innings. West Indies confirmed he was being sent for a scan on his left thigh on Saturday afternoon. The uncapped 27-year-old Marquino Mindley has been called into the squad and will arrive in Adelaide on Monday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0L3N0b3J5L2F1c3RyYWxpYS12cy13ZXN0LWluZGllcy1rZWVwaW5nLXRoZS1maW5nZXJzLWNyb3NzZWQtc2F5cy1wYXQtY3VtbWlucy1hcy1oZS1wcm92aWRlcy1pbmp1cnktdXBkYXRlLTIzMDUxNjAtMjAyMi0xMi0wNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australia vs West Indies: Keeping the fingers crossed says Pat Cummins as he provides injury update,"Pat Cummins has offered an injury update after Australia's win over West Indies in the first test match on Sunday saying that he will keeping his fingers crossed for the next few days.

Cummins was absent when Australia took to the field as he was experiencing some soreness on his quadriceps. The hosts would ultimately win the Test match by 164 runs thanks to Nathan Lyon's six-wicket haul.

Speaking after the match as quoted by Cricbuzz Cummins said he is doing well at the moment and it's not too bad and he will be available for the Adelaide Test and will be keeping his fingers crossed for the next few days.

""I'm doing well just have a tight quad. It's not too bad I was about to bowl but it didn't too close. It feels fine. The boys called it a jog (while fielding) I was happy with it tried to be protective and hopefully I will be available for Adelaide. Keeping the fingers crossed for the next couple of days"" said Cummins.

Cummins also praised Australia team for their all-round effort to seal the win in the first Test.

""On Aussie wickets you are going to get big partnerships especially when the wicket flattens out. The batters did their job the quicks stood up it was a fantastic all-round performance"" said Cummins.

The Australia captain went on to praise Marnus Labuschagne who scored a double hundred and hundred and also said that Lyon was the most important bowler in team.

""Marnus is ridiculous he has a big appetite for runs. Lyon is the most important bowler in our team he keeps taking wickets. There wasn't much on offer for the spinners but he found out a way and kept picking wickets"" said Cummins.

The second Test between Australia and West Indies will start on 8th December."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amgen Inc's experimental obesity drug demonstrated promising durability trends in an early trial paving the way for a larger mid-stage study early next year company officials said ahead of a data presentation on Saturday.

The small Phase I trial found that patients maintained their weight loss for 70 days after receiving the highest tested dose of the injected drug currently known as AMG133.

Amgen shares have gained about 5% since the company said on Nov. 7 that 12 weeks of trial treatment at the highest monthly dose of AMG133 resulted in mean weight loss of 14.5%.

At 150 days after the last dose maintained weight loss had dropped to 11.2% below original weight at the start of the trial according to findings detailed at a meeting of World Congress of Insulin Resistance Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease in Los Angeles.

Patients treated with AMG133 did have side effects including nausea and vomiting but most cases were mild and resolved within a couple of days after the first dose Amgen said.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more that 40% of the U.S. population is obese costing nearly $173 billion annually. It is a primary cause of type 2 diabetes and been linked to heart disease certain cancers and other health complications such as more severe COVID-19.

The weight loss field has gained renewed medical and investor attention in recent months after diabetes drugs from Eli Lilly and Co and Novo Nordisk known as semaglutide and tirzepatide were proven to help obese patients lose weight.

Both of those drugs which need to be injected every two weeks are designed to activate GLP-1 a hormone that triggers the feeling of fullness in the body after eating.

Amgen's AMG133 also targets GLP-1 but has a dual mechanism which aims at the same time to block activity of a gene known as GIP.

The drug was developed from work at Amgen to identify genetic signals associated with lower fat mass and body weight and also healthy metabolic profiles explained Saptarsi Haldar head of cardiovascular metabolic discovery at Amgen.

""Genetics clearly showed in multiple large populations that decreased activity genetically of the GIP receptor gene was associated with lower BMI (body mass index)"" he said.

The California-based biotech said it plans to launch a larger mid-stage study of AMG133 early next year which will enroll a broader range of patients including those with additional health conditions such as diabetes.

JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott earlier this month said that if all goes well a Phase III study of AMG133 could begin in 2024 with a launch expected in 2026 or 2027 if approved.

(WBAY) - For thieves ‘tis the season to be naughty. Scammers are sending out emails pretending to offer deals from major retailers.

In this Consumer First Alert we show you how to spot a fake.

One of the emails purports to be an offer for a Kohl’s loyalty program with a pricy Le Creuset dutch oven as a reward.

Another offer pretends to be from Dick’s Sporting Goods promising an expensive Yeti cooler to entice you to click a link.

Another phony offer uses the Costco logo to entice you to click on a marketing survey to win $90.

An impostor using CVS asks you to share your pharmacy experience for a cash reward.

The Federal Trade Commission says scammers send thousands of these phishing attacks per day. They make changes to messages hoping to convince.

“Scammers are using any way they can to get your attention” says Tiffany Schultz Better Business Bureau of Wisconsin.

Never click on these links. Schultz explains how to spot a fake.

“All you have to do is look in the email address. You can actually hover over the email address. If it’s coming from Amazon or Kohl’s or Dick’s Sporting Goods it’s going to be something like info@kohls info@dickssportinggoods not a bunch of gibberish. These promotions that are being sent to you via email are actually phishing attempts designed to get your personal information or they could possibly be downloading malware or spyware to your device once you click on that link. So if you get something like this and it’s not coming from a legitimate retailer go ahead and delete it and don’t even open it” Schultz says.

Dick’s Sporting Goods is trying to get ahead of the scammers with a warning on the retailer’s website.

The company shares examples of scam emails and text messages.

So what if you fall for a phishing scam? If you suspect a scammer has your credit card bank account or social security number you can find help at the government’s Identity Theft website.

The website walks you through steps to follow based on the information you lost.

One victim thought he won a free product from Kohl’s and said he was asked for a credit card to pay for the shipping. He ended up getting a second charge for nearly $100.

If the offer seems too good to be true - especially if it’s free - it’s likely fake.

On Sunday morning Ducks’ standout cornerback Christian Gonzalez officially declared for the NFL Draft ending his career at Oregon after just one season.

What a season it was.

Gonzalez came to Eugene as a transfer from the Colorado Buffaloes and instantly slotted in as the No. 1 cornerback for the Ducks. In 12 games Gonzalez had 4 total interceptions and 7 PBU’s adding 50 total tackles. The best game of his season came on the road against his former team where Gonzalez had two interceptions with 77 return yards.

Gonzalez has seen his name rise up the NFL draft boards after this stellar season in Eugene and is projected as a top-10 draft pick in some areas and a sure-fire first-round pick nearly everywhere. He will more than likely join the class of former Ducks to be taken in the first round later this spring.

CLEVELAND — Rainy conditions didn’t stop the town of Cleveland from having the 50th annual Cleveland Christmas Parade hosted by the Cleveland Lions Club on Saturday with community members lining up on Main Street to watch the floats go by.

West Rowan High School’s JROTC led the way marching in front of the school’s marching band. Cars trucks golf carts muscle cars and motorcycles all with Christmastime decorations followed tossing out candy to scrambling kids trying to get as much of the sweet stuff as they can.

Floats from various organizations participated in the parade including Cornerstone Baptist Church the Cleveland American Legion Pure Martial Arts Kiddleland Kindergarten Rowan County Emergency Services Salisbury Parks and Rec BoogerWoods the police and fire departments and the Rowan County Democratic and Republican parties among others.

Coming in at the rear of the parade were a group of horse riders John Deere tractors and a BoogerWoods Haunted Attraction blowing out snow. Santa Claus and his elf were the last ones to drive through sitting in his sleigh atop an old Cleveland 45 firetruck ho-ho-hoing and wishing people a Merry Christmas.

Food vendors were set up down the street where the parade finished and afterwards community members gathered to relax share stories and eat.

Thomasina Cuthbertson was watching from the sidewalk with her niece Haylen who was running around picking up candy the floats were tossing to her. Cuthbertson said the parade means a lot to everyone in Cleveland.

“It pulls us together” said Cuthbertson. “People come back home see people you hadn’t seen in awhile it’s nice.”

Another one of Cuthbertson’s nieces’ was in the parade with the West Rowan Majorettes and she has had other family members who have participated in the parade throughout the years.

Chariot Smyre and Paula Waiters were also watching the parade outside the Third Creek African Methodist Episcopal Zion church. Waiters was serving food including fish sandwiches wings hot dogs coffee hot chocolates cole slaw and beans. She said there is always a rush of people coming into the church after the parade ends.

“I just like to see people coming out and having a good time watching the children and even the grown folks reaching for the candy” Waiters said.

Smyre who grew up in Cleveland has a house right on the corner of Krider Street where the floats turn in to start the parade down Main Street. She has attended the parade every year of her life.

“I think it’s the best I don’t even go to one of the Salisbury’s parades” Smyre said. “This is all I need.”

At the end of the event parade winners were announced for the participants in the following categories: Antique – Orange Blossom Express by Joseph Hampton

Commercial – Cool Springs Mobile Vet

Horse – Chloe & Hailey Holshouser

Humorous – Boogerwoods Haunted Attraction.

Queen- Miss Rowan County Veteran – Rachel Webster.

We're here today to discuss first-world pain.

It's not the same as many other pains.

It enjoys a more refined quality one that seeps into well-washed pores and hovers over already-strained nerves.

Over recent months one of these first-world pains has recently been plaguing regular flyers.

Most of all regular flyers on Delta Air Lines.

Also: These are my 5 must-have devices for work travel now

Since the pandemic began to ebb and customers began flying regularly for business and leisure -- sometimes at the same time -- Delta experienced an ever more exasperating problem.

Its customers desperately wanted to use its fine Sky Clubs. To lounge you understand and to separate themselves from the less well-washed.

It seemed worse for Delta because it suddenly had so many passengers -- among them American Express Platinum cardholders -- who enjoyed eligibility. The lounge lines became long and languorous.

Delta restricted access to those with a flight three or fewer hours after entry. It tried to create two lanes dividing those who truly deserved instant access from those who may have been of slightly lower caliber.

This seems however not to have been enough.

The Airline Observer reports that the airline now has another idea to divide and conquer. You'll need to focus on the nuances.

If you're a Delta flyer who enjoys elite status you may now be denied access to a Sky Club lounge if you're merely flying economy class or Comfort+. Long-haul that is.

Also: Here's how to keep your home secure when you travel

Complicated isn't it? You might have just flown in somewhere forgotten what class you were in and lined up for a lounge only to be told the cut of your jib isn't quite up to scratch any more.

Worse many customers have actually paid -- extra that is -- specifically for Sky Club membership. Even they may not be allowed in. You might think this a trifle but Executive Membership of Sky Club is $845.

I should add that Delta's final announcement of all these changes had a number of finely tuned kinks.

The Points Guy has a detailed summary one that requires consummate concentration.

How about this one? From January only a Medallion elite member can now buy a Sky Club membership. And the cost? Lookee here. The ordinary membership is now $695 but the aforementioned Executive membership is oh $1495.

Lordy.

You might be wondering whether Delta is being a touch mean or even condescending. You might also be wondering why the airline would consider such moves.

Well it appears Delta isn't best pleased with the bad publicity engendered by its long lounge lines. Which is odd as long lines worked wonders to burnish the image of Apple stores.

One can understand Delta's desperation while also musing that the airline could have seen this coming. Because it created the problem in the first place.

If you allow a vast swathe of the world's flying population access to your (allegedly) exclusive club -- especially to those who are part of your SkyTeam alliance -- how can you then tell them that no they're not so welcome anymore?

And how can you tell those revered American Express Platinum members -- who pay $750 for the card and its perks -- that their card doesn't have quite the power they thought?

It seems Delta has merely chosen to insult a lot of the medium elites -- the aspirers the savers the desperados. Is there indeed anything worse than promising a certain benefit and then taking it away just like that?

Perhaps the only ultimate solution is to be extremely draconian. Limit entry to the very very very elevated elite few and let everyone else wonder what goes on behind your opaque doors. Dancing troupes? Exclusive star performances?

Oh and give current Sky Club members their money back.

It seems Delta is drifting towards completely redefining exclusivity.

Which may leave one or two regular flyers to wonder: Is it really worth it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2RlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy1vZmZlcnMtcGlsb3RzLW5ldy1jb250cmFjdC1wb3RlbnRpYWwtc3RyaWtlLWxvb21z0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvZGVsdGEtYWlyLWxpbmVzLW9mZmVycy1waWxvdHMtbmV3LWNvbnRyYWN0LXBvdGVudGlhbC1zdHJpa2UtbG9vbXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines offers pilots a new contract as potential strike looms,"Delta Air Lines has offered its pilots a substantial pay increase in a new contract to help offset increased working hours and short-staffed conditions and avoid a potential workers' strike.

The new contract comes as pandemic-related staffing shortages have been met with a regular boom in holiday-related travel. Also union workers for railroad companies successfully flexed their own negotiating power amid these same conditions.

These factors have enhanced the bargaining power of pilots who voted to strike if a new agreement is not ratified.

Delta Air Lines seeks to get ahead of any potential strike — which railroad workers threatened for months — in a new agreement that gives pilots a 34% cumulative pay increase over three years according to Reuters.

DELTA CEO SAYS NO PILOT STRIKE DURING HIGH-DEMAND PERIOD

The deal now goes to the Delta pilots for consideration.

If the deal is approved the agreement could serve as a benchmark for pilots at United Airlines and American Airlines.

Reuters reports the agreement gives Delta pilots an immediate raise of at least 18% on the date the contract is signed. The pilots would receive another 5% raise after one year 4% after two years and 4% after three years.

DELTA AIR LINES SEES STRONG HOLIDAY TRAVEL DESPITE INFLATION

In the agreement Delta promises to pay its employees more than that of United Airlines and American Airlines by at least 1%.

The offer also includes a one-time payment valued at a cumulative 22% of their earnings between 2020 and 2022 that will be paid once the deal is ratified Reuters reported.

Delta Air Lines pilots have not received a new contract since their previous agreement became amendable in December 2019. The lack of any improvements has sown frustration among some workers.

In October workers voted overwhelmingly to strike if negotiators failed to produce a new contract.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWRkbGV5b3Vyb3dua2Fub28uY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMDQvdGhlLWZhc2NpbmF0aW5nLW1lLXRvby1jbGF1c2UtdGhhdC13aWxsLWd1YXJhbnRlZS1kZWx0YS1haXItcGlsb3RzLXRoZS1iZXN0LXBheS1pbi10aGUtaW5kdXN0cnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Fascinating 'Me Too' Clause That Will Guarantee Delta Air Pilots The Best Pay in the Industry,"Pilots at Delta Air Lines are tipped to win a bumper pay rise worth around 34 percent of cumulative pay over the next four years plus a guarantee that their wages will always be at least 1 percent higher than their peers at both American Airlines and United Airlines.

The details of the tentative deal were leaked on Saturday in a memo from the Delta pilots union. Members of the Delta branch of the Allied Pilots Union (ALPA) must still vote in favor of the proposed contract.

If approved around 15000 Delta pilots would receive an immediate 18 percent pay rise plus a one-time payment equivalent to 22 percent of their earnings between 2020 and 2022.

Pilots would then receive a 5 per cent pay rise after the first year of the contract and then two 4 percent pay rises in the two years thereafter. Over the course of the contract pilots will earn a minimum pay increase of 34 percent.

Interestingly however the tentative agreement also includes what is known in labor circles as a ‘me too’ clause which benchmarks the Delta pilot’s contract against other workgroups.

In this case the ALPA have managed to get Delta management to benchmark the provisional contract against their peers at American Airlines and United who are both still in active contract talks with their pilots.

If either American Airlines or United were to offer their pilots better pay than what has already been negotiated at Delta the Atlanta-based airline has promised to beat any deal by at least 1 percent ensuring that Delta pilots remain the best paid in the industry.

Delta pilots have been working to secure a new contract since 2019 when a now six-year-old contract became amendable. Pay rates and other contract provisions have remained unchanged since 2016 when the last contract was agreed.

Negotiations were put on hold during the pandemic but coming out the other side airlines have found themselves facing a severe pilot shortage putting unions in the driving seat in contract talks.

At the end of October Delta pilots voted overwhelmingly in favor of authorizing strike action after contract talks faltered. Negotiations have been taking place ever since that historic vote.

On top of a bumper pay rise pilots will also win quality of life improvements including ten weeks of paid maternity leave improved crew meals and enhanced health insurance.

In a statement the airline said it was “pleased to have reached an agreement in principle for a new pilot contract one that recognizes the contributions of our pilots to Delta’s success.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMvYWlybGluZXMvZGVsdGEtYWlyLWxpbmVzL3doaWNoLWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkLWRlbHRhLWZsaWdodHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best credit cards to use for Delta Air Lines flights,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMvYWlybGluZXMvZGVsdGEtYWlyLWxpbmVzL3doaWNoLWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkLWRlbHRhLWZsaWdodHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C48ED4FF10>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The number 12 is tightly linked with December. It's the 12th month of course. There are 12 days of Christmas according to the traditional carol. Allow me to add one more connection with 12 to the list. Here are 12 top stocks to buy in December (listed alphabetically by category).

Energizers

Let's start off with a group I called the ""energizers."" These are stocks of companies that are in the energy sector and have solid prospects going into the new year.

1. Brookfield Renewable

The shift to renewable energy is arguably one of the most unstoppable trends around. Countries and companies across the world are scrambling to reduce their carbon emissions. That points to a bright future for Brookfield Renewable (BEP 1.34%) (BEPC 2.08%). The company currently operates hydroelectric wind solar and distributed energy facilities with a combined capacity of 24 gigawatts. Brookfield Renewable's development pipeline capacity is more than 4 times greater.

2. Devon Energy

Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%) has been a big winner in 2022 soaring close to 60% year to date. The oil and gas producer should be able to perform well in 2023 as well with Devon likely to generate strong free cash flow. Even if the stock doesn't sizzle in the new year investors can enjoy Devon's juicy dividend yield of 8%.

3. Enterprise Products Partners

Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.59%) stands out as another high-yield dividend stock that's practically a no-brainer pick. The midstream energy company offers a dividend yield of nearly 7.8%. Enterprise has increased its dividend for 24 consecutive years. And its fortunes don't depend on fuel prices. The company charges fees for transporting fuels and chemicals through its pipelines that aren't based on commodity prices at all.

4. Occidental Petroleum

Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.04%) has been an especially big winner this year with its shares skyrocketing 140%. You can thank Warren Buffett for part of this impressive gain. Buffett has loaded up on Occidental stock for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. I think the Buffett effect will continue into 2023. Berkshire secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of Occidental but currently owns only 21.4%.

Healthy picks

Whether or not a recession is on the way remains to be seen. But several healthcare stocks should be able to deliver solid gains no matter what happens.

5. Axsome Therapeutics

Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM -1.60%) stock has nearly doubled this year. Wall Street thinks it can go a lot higher. I agree. Axsome now has a potentially huge winner with major depressive disorder drug Auvelity on the market. It also expects to file for U.S. regulatory approvals in 2023 for AXS-07 in treating migraines and AXS-14 in treating fibromyalgia.

6. Novocure

Novocure (NVCR 2.11%) is another healthcare stock that could soon skyrocket. The company plans to announce results from a late-stage study evaluating its tumor treating fields (TTFields) therapy in treating non-small cell lung cancer in early 2023. Novocure also has data from three other late-stage studies of TTFields on the way over the next couple of years.

7. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

I view Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.91%) as a virtually unstoppable growth stock to buy and hold. The company has a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. It should soon file for regulatory approvals of exa-cel in treating (to be more precise curing) rare blood disorders sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Vertex's pipeline is also loaded with potential blockbuster therapies.

Tech and fintech

Sure tech and fintech stocks have taken a beating in 2022. But the future should be brighter over the long run -- especially for these two stocks.

8. Alphabet

I think Alphabet (GOOG -0.75%) (GOOGL -0.77%) is the best FAANG stock to buy in December. The Google parent's moat remains strong. Its growth prospects look great particularly with Google Cloud. Alphabet could also have some game changers in its ""other bets"" portfolio.

9. Mercadolibre

MercadoLibre (MELI -0.08%) stands out as a company whose stock performance hasn't reflected its underlying business strength in 2022. The Latin American e-commerce and fintech leader delivered 61% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarter. Look for MercadoLibre to rebound strongly once macroeconomic worries subside.

The REIT stuff

Some of the stocks already mentioned could appeal to income investors (namely Devon and Enterprise Products Partners). However there are also a few real estate investment trusts (REITs) that offer fantastic dividends and have solid long-term growth potential.

10. Digital Realty Trust

Digital Realty Trust (DLR -1.45%) is a data center REIT with a dividend yield of nearly 4.5%. CEO Bill Stein noted in the company's third-quarter earnings call that there are ""powerful long-term secular demand trends broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT."" He's right -- and that translates to great opportunities for this REIT going forward.

11. Easterly Government Properties

If you're looking for a super-safe business Easterly Government Properties (DEA) could be just the ticket. The REIT leases properties to U.S. government agencies. The risk of missed rents (one of the biggest threats to REITs) is practically nonexistent for Easterly. Investors should also like Easterly's dividend yield of more than 6.7%.

12. Medical Properties Trust

Last but not least Medical Properties Trust (MPW 1.92%) is a healthcare REIT with a mouth-watering dividend yield of nearly 9.2%. The financial outlook for the hospital operators that lease MPT's properties should improve with higher reimbursements on the way. With its attractive dividend and valuation (shares trade at under seven times expected earnings) MPT looks like a great beaten-down stock to buy in December.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL2RlYy8wNC9nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWNoYW9zLWRlbGF5cy11ay1zYWhhcmEtZW5lcmd5LWxpbmvSAV5odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi9kZWMvMDQvZ292ZXJubWVudC1jaGFvcy1kZWxheXMtdWstc2FoYXJhLWVuZXJneS1saW5r?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,£18bn project to link UK to huge wind and solar farm in Sahara delayed by a year,"An £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable has been delayed by at least a year because of political ructions in Westminster.

The energy startup Xlinks hopes to provide 8% of Britain’s electricity supplies through a 3800km (2360-mile) cable linking Morocco with the UK powering 7m homes by 2030.

The project had been expected to begin generating power by 2027. However that target date now appears unlikely.

The Xlinks’ executive chair Sir Dave Lewis a former chief executive of Tesco warned that the recent political turmoil that has seen off three prime ministers in less than six months has stalled its progress.

He has been trying to secure a government “contract for difference” – a mechanism under which public subsidies are used to offer low-carbon generators such as windfarms a fixed price for power. The arrangement aims to encourage investment by making revenues more predictable.

Lewis told the Guardian: “We spent a long time with the then business secretary [Kwasi Kwarteng] who said: ‘We like it a lot but it needs to go through Treasury.’ There was a review with Treasury Cabinet Office and the business department which was very positive.

“Then we came back to them to start the detail and the political world exploded and as a result everything stopped. And everybody has changed so it’s sort of like you’re starting again.

“Time is important for the UK to meet its net zero ambitions to secure energy supplies and to reduce bills. We have lost a year.”

Xlinks was founded in 2019 by its chief executive Simon Morrish who has grown the environmental services business Ground Control across the UK.

When the Morocco-UK link is complete Xlinks expects to generate 20 hours of reliable renewable energy a day using the Sahara’s sunshine and breezy night-time conditions.

The plan is to build almost 12m solar panels and 530 windfarms over the 960 sq km area of desert. The site in the Guelmim-Oued Noun region will also have 20 gigawatt hours of battery storage.

The cable transporting power from the site will hug the Moroccan coastline then pass alongside Portugal northern Spain and France before looping around the Isles of Scilly to terminate at Alverdiscott in north Devon where Xlinks has already agreed to 1.8 gigawatt connections.

Morocco has an established wind solar and hydroelectric power industry and its solar intensity a measure of generation power is second only to Egypt and double that of the UK according to data from Xlinks.

The power lines will be laid by the world’s largest cable-laying ship and buried beneath the seabed to mitigate the risk of damage from fishing boats. The company is in the process of studying the seabed and gaining offshore permits.

Xlinks hopes to land a strike price of £48 per megawatt hour lower than the £92.50 agreed for the delayed Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset.

The company argues that despite the scale of the project it can be more reliable for the security of UK energy supplies than domestic options because UK wind power can be hugely variable. Last week National Grid issued and later cancelled preparations to launch its emergency winter plan after low wind and solar power left supplies tight.

Lewis has personally invested in the Xlinks project along with Octopus Energy and its founder Greg Jackson.

Growing demand for renewable power has stretched supplies across the industry. In response its sister company XLCC plans to build two factories to manufacture cables in Hunterston on the west coast of Scotland and another at a yet to be announced site in north-east England. The first received planning permission in June and is expected to create 900 jobs.

Lewis who worked for the consumer goods company Unilever for 27 years became Tesco’s chief executive in 2014. He quickly had to tackle an accounting black hole and is credited with turning around Britain’s largest retailer before leaving in 2020. He is now chair of Haleon the consumer goods company spun off from GlaxoSmithKline earlier this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9rZWhhbXB0b24tdG9kYXkuY28udWsvbmV3cy9va2VoYW1wdG9uLXRvd24tY291bmNpbC10by1zdWdnZXN0LXdlc3QtZGV2b24tc3BlZWR3YXRjaC01ODA0MTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Okehampton Town Council to suggest West Devon speedwatch,All 11 chose to speak to the pupils who asked them questions such as: How would you feel if you had run me over?

First the pandemic hit forcing me to stay in place in my one-bedroom NYC apartment. Three months later my father passed away and I moved back to the U.K. to look after my mum who was left all alone. Four months after that I moved back to the States — via 3 weeks in Dubai as I couldn't fly direct — and three days after that disaster hit. I'll always remember Friday November 27 2020. At 3 am I woke up with my heart beating out of control and I knew I was having a heart attack. My initial thought was to go take a shower and two years later I'm very glad I didn't as I now know wouldn't have survived. When I got to the hospital about 20 minutes later my heart rate was over 180 and a hot shower would have pushed it to over 210.

Living with the risk of hereditary diabetes and heart disease

Diabetes runs in my family. All of my father's male siblings are diabetic and while I'm the first of my generation to be diagnosed with diabetes I have known there was a very strong chance I would be a diabetic. For some people this would mean taking care of yourself and doing your best to prevent it from happening but my younger self failed to do that. In 2019 my average glucose was 7.19 percent which classified me as a diabetic but had I caught it then — and the cholesterol problems which ultimately led to a blockage in my left anterior descending artery (a.k.a. the widowmaker) — I would have prevented the heart attack. At the time of my heart attack just 18 months later my average glucose had grown exponentially to over 10 percent and so began a lifetime of medication and care as well as the knowledge that diabetes is now something I have to live with. The power of a CGM

Most diabetics have to use a fingerstick to check their blood sugar three times a day. This is the recognized method for checking blood sugar at home and it works albeit it with faults. The principal fault is that it only provides a snapshot at that given moment in time and it doesn't provide any information about the trends of your blood sugar. For example I checked my blood sugar in the morning and it would seem normal but once I switched to a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) I realized that it was actually rising having been low in the early hours before waking up. Similarly post breakfast I would check my blood sugar but sometimes be too early to check it — versus exactly two hours after eating — and it was only after starting to use a CGM that I realized how long it takes my body to normalize after a meal; for most people it's two hours but my blood sugar will take up to four hours to completely normalize after a meal. It took a while for me to learn this.

A CGM like FreeStyle Libre lets you discretely check your blood sugar in public.

Then we come to the social stigma of diabetes. Although it's a very common disease — according to the CDC more than 37 million people have diabetes or about 10 percent of the American population — there's a stigma associated with going out for dinner but needing to draw blood from your finger to check your sugar. In any public environment I found that I was less inclined to want to check my blood sugar mostly for the fear of what someone would think. A CGM works differently than a fingerstick checker and it's not as accurate but even a regular fingerstick checker isn't as accurate as a medical device. The acceptable degree of error is about 10% percent above or below a blood reading and the difference is mostly due to how they work. The National Institute of Health summarizes it best: A CGM works through a tiny sensor inserted under your skin usually on your belly or arm. The sensor measures your interstitial glucose level which is the glucose found in the fluid between the cells. The sensor tests glucose every few minutes. A transmitter wirelessly sends the information to a monitor. Now that the science part is over here's how the FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitor quite literally saved my life. How I nearly halved my average glucose

As I covered in our Apple Watch Ultra review I'm a huge fan of using technology to manage my health. Specifically I'm willing to try new pieces of tech if it means that my daily tasks — such as taking meds and checking blood pressure or blood sugar — are more integrated into my tech habits. Figuring out how to check my blood sugar in a more digital way led me to a CGM.

Every individual is different and using the FreeStyle Libre allowed me to see how to apply diabetic best practices to my individual needs.

I am a big fan of the FreeStyle Libre over the other alternative (namely DexCom) because it is smaller only requires a single sensor on your arm (versus transmitter and sensor with the Dexcom) and can be checked via the LibreLink app on my phone. Dexcom offers many of the same things and the upcoming Dexcom G7 will be the size of the FreeStyle Libre but it is harder to get approved through insurance — well my insurer in the US at least — unless you're taking insulin which I do not. Initially my usage of the CGM was mostly to replicate the fingersticks which meant scanning my phone on the reader three times per day. However very quickly the true power of the CGM became apparent; it gives you eight hours of historical data making it very easy for me to actually track how specific foods and activities affect my blood sugar. And this helped me cut my average glucose almost in half in a little over six months.

Understanding how specific foods impacted my blood sugar then gave me the ability to truly understand how diabetes affected my body and how my diet was impacting my life. Most people believe something as innocuous as cereal would probably be considered a good diet. Except for me cereal first thing in the morning caused my average glucose to be higher throughout the day regardless of which cereal I chose or even if I added a protein source. Switching to an egg-based breakfast and having brunch instead of breakfast and lunch allowed me to drop the average glucose keep my glucose stable throughout the day and drop considerable weight. Some endocrinologists — the professional term for someone who studies hormones and the person who'll ultimately be your healthcare professional when managing diabetes — will tell you to eat around 5 or 6 pm. However when I do so my blood sugar runs super low in the early hours of the morning which I wouldn't be aware of without the CGM. Moving this to between 6:30 and 8 pm allows my blood sugar to remain stable throughout the night. Why I recommend the FreeStyle Libre to every diabetic In my opinion every single diabetic should use a continuous glucose monitor for a few key reasons. The first is that it provides considerable amounts of data that are just not possible to get otherwise. In the app I can see the average glucose over the past seven 14 30 and 90 days as well as graphs of how this appears during the day and my glucose averages over specific times of the day. FreeStyle Libre taught me this.

A CGM helps you save money get better data and ultimately helps you more than just pricking your finger three times per day.

The second is that it really helps you understand how specific foods will impact your diabetes. Coming from an Indian background traditional vegetarian curries formed a large part of my diet yet these caused the biggest spike in my blood sugar as they weren't balanced even when adding dal. Replacing these with grilled chicken salads — even when using Indian spices — completely transformed my average glucose during the later part of the day. FreeStyle Libre taught me this. When you're a diabetic more care has to be taken around things like exercising. You can't just go for a run or a brisk walk; instead it's recommended that you check your blood sugar to ensure that it isn't too low before you start as exercise is the best way to reduce your blood sugar but doing so when it's already low can result in it dropping to dangerous levels. If you're out and about it's near-impossible to check your blood sugar when you've just had to do some unplanned exercise — such as running for a bus — and it's also impossible to do so if you forgot to carry your fingersticks with you. With a CGM all you need is your phone and it's that simple. That's not to say that CGMs are perfect. Sometimes they fail. Other times the readings are inaccurate and it recommends you check your sugar via your fingerstick. The FreeStyle Libre also can't be calibrated meaning some mental maths may be involved if you want it to be as accurate as possible. Despite these shortcomings there's one final reason it's completely worth getting a CGM: price. Diabetes care in the US is frankly ridiculously priced. A box of 100 sticks can cost over $100 and I was spending about $150 per month just on diabetic supplies such as fingersticks and alcohol wipes. In comparison with insurance my CGM costs me $68 for 28 days and averages out to about $81.50 per month throughout the year. You save money you get better data and it will ultimately help you more than just pricking your finger three times per day. The FreeStyle Libre is not just for diabetics",,,,,,,,,,,,

We all know that. But bad data often culminate in other problems that are more insidious – and just as harmful to the organization.

Here are some of the hidden problems of bad data.

It takes up valuable resources

Speaking at a roundtable discussion at the Informatica World Tour held in Singapore last month Peter Ku the vice president and chief industry strategist for Financial Services at Informatica shared an anecdote of a chief executive officer who was insistent that his organization’s data was perfect.

It turned out that the executive’s opinion was informed by the accurate reports and dashboards that he was perusing. Unbeknownst to him however a significant amount of effort was devoted to cleaning and correcting errors in the data by a team of financial analysts who spent most of their time on this task.

Beyond the obvious issue of how a lack of data management processes often results in bad data businesses must awaken to the fact that bad data is often obscured by well-meaning efforts to clean them. In this instance bad data was invisible to a top executive by the simple fact of employees acting responsibly and endeavoring to produce good work.

In this case highly qualified employees hired to move the needle on innovation or to increase profitability ended up cleaning data and correcting mundane data mistakes. The solution? Implement appropriate data governance and tools to enforce good data ensuring that valuable resources are not wasted on correcting bad data.

It erodes trust

We all know that poor data can lead to subpar decisions. But the biggest danger of poor analytics or inaccurate reports is an erosion of trust that puts employees off data-driven decisions. Moreover employees who choose to ignore data are unlikely to tell you that which simply amplifies the problem.

Imagine meetings where everyone nods their head over charts and dashboards but continues to base vital business decisions on their “gut feel”. This becomes a self-reinforcing cycle when the deliberate ignoring of data culminates in atrophied data skills which leads them to further reduce the use of data.

To build a strong foundation that builds trust start with small pilots that favor data accuracy and leverage it to develop competency with data. Also some data vendors think that the huge amount of data that businesses currently grapple with simply cannot be managed manually.

According to them manual data quality management cannot scale to today’s volume and necessitates the implementation of automated processes for auditing assessing and cleaning their data. Of course these vendors have something to sell you – though I think they might have a point here.

It puts customers off

Ever received a marketing email that got your name wrong or reference information that is years out of date? How did you feel? Unfortunately it can be next to impossible to fix certain types of “bad” data.

People change jobs and relocate. They get married and their priorities change as kids come along and parents grow old. Their preference might vary over time. How are organizations to know?

While this is true I would also argue that good data processes along with a strong data culture can go a long way toward ensuring that relevant data gleaned at all customer touchpoints are properly captured and updated.

As I wrote previously establishing a strong data culture is difficult. It requires embedding data into the very fabric of the organization and an aspiration to get everybody to see the value in data and proper training and continually inspiring everyone to leverage data for better decision-making. It is also non-negotiable.

To be clear it is not a one-time achievement but a continuous process. And not fixing a poor data culture is akin to helping a hoarder clean up without addressing the underlying issues.

As the pace of transformation picks up around the world the onus is on business leaders to bring about the necessary focus on data to help their organizations thrive. And as noted by a participant at a recent CDOTrends roundtable the best time to change was yesterday. If not there is no time like today.

The number 12 is tightly linked with December. It's the 12th month of course. There are 12 days of Christmas according to the traditional carol. Allow me to add one more connection with 12 to the list. Here are 12 top stocks to buy in December (listed alphabetically by category).

Energizers

Let's start off with a group I called the ""energizers."" These are stocks of companies that are in the energy sector and have solid prospects going into the new year.

1. Brookfield Renewable

The shift to renewable energy is arguably one of the most unstoppable trends around. Countries and companies across the world are scrambling to reduce their carbon emissions. That points to a bright future for Brookfield Renewable (BEP 1.34%) (BEPC 2.08%). The company currently operates hydroelectric wind solar and distributed energy facilities with a combined capacity of 24 gigawatts. Brookfield Renewable's development pipeline capacity is more than 4 times greater.

2. Devon Energy

Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%) has been a big winner in 2022 soaring close to 60% year to date. The oil and gas producer should be able to perform well in 2023 as well with Devon likely to generate strong free cash flow. Even if the stock doesn't sizzle in the new year investors can enjoy Devon's juicy dividend yield of 8%.

3. Enterprise Products Partners

Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.59%) stands out as another high-yield dividend stock that's practically a no-brainer pick. The midstream energy company offers a dividend yield of nearly 7.8%. Enterprise has increased its dividend for 24 consecutive years. And its fortunes don't depend on fuel prices. The company charges fees for transporting fuels and chemicals through its pipelines that aren't based on commodity prices at all.

4. Occidental Petroleum

Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.04%) has been an especially big winner this year with its shares skyrocketing 140%. You can thank Warren Buffett for part of this impressive gain. Buffett has loaded up on Occidental stock for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. I think the Buffett effect will continue into 2023. Berkshire secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of Occidental but currently owns only 21.4%.

Healthy picks

Whether or not a recession is on the way remains to be seen. But several healthcare stocks should be able to deliver solid gains no matter what happens.

5. Axsome Therapeutics

Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM -1.60%) stock has nearly doubled this year. Wall Street thinks it can go a lot higher. I agree. Axsome now has a potentially huge winner with major depressive disorder drug Auvelity on the market. It also expects to file for U.S. regulatory approvals in 2023 for AXS-07 in treating migraines and AXS-14 in treating fibromyalgia.

6. Novocure

Novocure (NVCR 2.11%) is another healthcare stock that could soon skyrocket. The company plans to announce results from a late-stage study evaluating its tumor treating fields (TTFields) therapy in treating non-small cell lung cancer in early 2023. Novocure also has data from three other late-stage studies of TTFields on the way over the next couple of years.

7. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

I view Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.91%) as a virtually unstoppable growth stock to buy and hold. The company has a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. It should soon file for regulatory approvals of exa-cel in treating (to be more precise curing) rare blood disorders sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Vertex's pipeline is also loaded with potential blockbuster therapies.

Tech and fintech

Sure tech and fintech stocks have taken a beating in 2022. But the future should be brighter over the long run -- especially for these two stocks.

8. Alphabet

I think Alphabet (GOOG -0.75%) (GOOGL -0.77%) is the best FAANG stock to buy in December. The Google parent's moat remains strong. Its growth prospects look great particularly with Google Cloud. Alphabet could also have some game changers in its ""other bets"" portfolio.

9. Mercadolibre

MercadoLibre (MELI -0.08%) stands out as a company whose stock performance hasn't reflected its underlying business strength in 2022. The Latin American e-commerce and fintech leader delivered 61% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarter. Look for MercadoLibre to rebound strongly once macroeconomic worries subside.

The REIT stuff

Some of the stocks already mentioned could appeal to income investors (namely Devon and Enterprise Products Partners). However there are also a few real estate investment trusts (REITs) that offer fantastic dividends and have solid long-term growth potential.

10. Digital Realty Trust

Digital Realty Trust (DLR -1.45%) is a data center REIT with a dividend yield of nearly 4.5%. CEO Bill Stein noted in the company's third-quarter earnings call that there are ""powerful long-term secular demand trends broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT."" He's right -- and that translates to great opportunities for this REIT going forward.

11. Easterly Government Properties

If you're looking for a super-safe business Easterly Government Properties (DEA) could be just the ticket. The REIT leases properties to U.S. government agencies. The risk of missed rents (one of the biggest threats to REITs) is practically nonexistent for Easterly. Investors should also like Easterly's dividend yield of more than 6.7%.

12. Medical Properties Trust

Last but not least Medical Properties Trust (MPW 1.92%) is a healthcare REIT with a mouth-watering dividend yield of nearly 9.2%. The financial outlook for the hospital operators that lease MPT's properties should improve with higher reimbursements on the way. With its attractive dividend and valuation (shares trade at under seven times expected earnings) MPT looks like a great beaten-down stock to buy in December.",,,,,,,,,

But it also has a thriving software-as-a-service business.

Mention the company Fair Isaac (FICO 3.25%) and the first thing that probably comes to mind is its trademark three-digit FICO score that consumers regularly see on their credit reports. After all FICO scoring plays a critical role in how people get approved for a variety of loans.

What those who know about the FICO scores may be aware of is the other main part of Fair Isaac's business its growing software division. This segment of the company leverages predictive modeling transaction profiling decision analysis and artificial intelligence to help companies better run their business. And while the FICO scoring division is a great business it's really the software division that has driven the stock 35% higher this year and to record highs.

Let's get to know Fair Isaac's software business and see what its future might hold for the company and for the stock.

The FICO platform

Fair Isaac's software has a wide array of offerings that help financial services companies and others across many industries run their businesses more efficiently. These offerings include productivity tools machine learning models data retrieval and mapping solutions real-time data insights business outcome simulators and pre-configured solutions such as fraud prevention.

For example the credit card and payments company Discover used Fair Isaac's software solutions to reduce debit card fraud losses on its PULSE network by 40%. Truist used Fair Isaac's platform to digitize credit originations. Non-banks such as the major testing organization ACT used the software to automate test development.

Fair Isaac has also developed its FICO platform which uses cloud architecture to bring data from multiple sources together gain enhanced insights and put those to work through real-time actions and workflows. FICO has moved a lot of its software decision onto the FICO platform and is investing significantly to move nearly all of its software solutions to the FICO platform.

Selling this kind of software involves long sales cycles but the company also gets rewarded with a pretty strong moat because the software is typically sold for multi-year subscriptions. There's also a land and expand component to the model so customers can become more profitable as they expand their usage of Fair Isaac's software solutions.

Strong growth and opportunities ahead

For the year ending Sept. 30 which is Fair Isaac's fiscal cycle the company generated roughly $1.38 billion of revenue. A little more than half of that came from the FICO scoring division while nearly 41% came from software (the remainder is professional services). Software revenue grew more than 9% from the fiscal year 2021 while scores revenue grew about 8%.

But within the software division the company breaks revenue out into non-platform revenue and platform revenue from the FICO platform and looks at it on an annualized revenue run-rate (ARR) basis. Platform revenue went from 11% of ARR software revenue at the end of 2020 to about 20% at the end of September. Platform ARR also more than doubled in this same time frame.

Fair Isaac's software solutions also have an international opportunity and are used by businesses in more than 120 countries. On Fair Isaac's most recent earnings call held on Nov. 9 CEO Will Lansing said the demand for its software solutions remains solid specifically on the international side where deals are not being pushed out or downsized despite the difficult operating environment.

Lansing also said on the call that of the company's target market -- the top 200 financial institutions globally -- Fair Isaac only has slightly more than 30 customers using the platform meaning there is ample runway to grow customers. He also sees significant expansion opportunities for existing clients.

The business is heating up

The strong outlook for the software division also translated to incredibly strong guidance for the fiscal year 2023 in which Fair Isaac is guiding for double-digit percentage earnings growth. This comes after Fair Isaac already raised its guidance mid-year and bought back 2.7 million shares in the fiscal year 2022. Clearly Fair Isaac's SaaS business has been a fantastic value add to the business and is a big reason the stock continues to outperform.",,,,,,,,,
DG,Dollar General,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzAyL2RvbGxhci1nZW5lcmFsLXN3YW1wZWQtYnktc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLWlzc3Vlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar General Is Swamped by Supply Chain Issues,"Consumers like the value but the deep discounter is having problems putting stock on the shelves.

For months we've been told that supply chain issues are beginning to ease. The reality however seems to be that logistical challenges are still very much a problem and they aren't going away anytime soon.

Just look at deep-discount retailer Dollar General (DG 0.06%) which continues to get slammed by supply chain disruptions. This causes higher-than-expected distribution and transportation costs. As a result the company will miss earnings expectations and lower guidance for the rest of the year.

Expectations run into reality

This should be a time when Dollar General shines. Rising prices higher interest rates and inflated gas prices mean consumers are looking to stretch their wallets as far as they can. That often means turning to deep discounters like Dollar General.

While the dollar-store chain did say revenue jumped 11.1% to $9.5 billion on a near-7% gain in comparable-store sales profits came in well short of analyst forecasts. This resulted in Dollar General slashing its earnings-growth guidance in half for the fiscal year. New-store openings are now expected to be toward the lower end of the company's prior guidance -- which was lowered last quarter -- as a result.

The new more dour outlook is because Dollar General's supply chain is nowhere near back to normal and the company expects that to continue through at least the fourth quarter. It has its fingers crossed that the damage the supply chain problems are causing will be less than they were in the third quarter.

After all management said last time out that as bad as the supply chain woes were they were seeing ""moderation"" going forward and expected to benefit in the back half of the year as the retailer lapped the significant supply chain inflation it witnessed a year ago. It's clear now that none of that happened or certainly not to the degree promised.

Choking off the supply chain

The biggest problem for Dollar General seems to be not having enough warehouse space to stock items to distribute to its stores. The retailer said it experienced ""unanticipated delays in acquiring additional temporary warehouse space which caused inefficiencies within the Company’s internal supply chain.""

A few years ago Dollar General brought its supply chain in-house through a pair of initiatives called DG Fresh and Fast Track. The purpose was not only to bring more fresh and frozen goods to its stores in a timely fashion but also to implement a new distribution system in its warehouses that pack up goods for shipment based on where they will be unpacked in the store. By having employees touch the merchandise as few times as possible it would speed up the process.

While these initiatives have helped Dollar General improve productivity since they were set up it's clear the broader macroeconomic headwinds the discounter faces were stronger than the efficiencies it planned for and these headwinds are raising its costs.

In particular Dollar General experienced ""materially higher"" costs for things such as late fees for shipping containers because it had to hold onto them longer since it had no place to temporarily put its merchandise. That in turn led to higher temporary storage and transportation costs and labor.

Wait for a discount in Dollar General's stock

Make no mistake -- Dollar General is a solid business and the issues it's facing are endemic to the entire country. While its 31 consecutive year run of same-store sales growth was broken last year due to the difficulty of overcoming the 16% gain in 2020 it's back on track in 2022 to resume its pattern of annual comps increases.

It's a notable achievement for a chain with such a large footprint as Dollar General to keep having customers come back again and again. Few other retailers of any size can hope to boast a similar record.

The higher sales it's seeing which come in part from customers returning to its stores and buying more when they visit shows they still find value at Dollar General. However its supply chain problems mean the retailer is leaving money on the table. While this is a good long-term investment its valuation is at a premium and investors should wait for a better entry point.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5cmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMTIvMDMvbmV3LWRvbGxhci1nZW5lcmFsLXN0b3JlLW5vdy1vcGVuLWluLWNvbGR3YXRlci82OTY5MDMxMjAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Dollar General store now open in Coldwater,"COLDWATER — Dollar General is excited to announce its store at 108 E.

Dollar General stores provide household essentials including food cleaning supplies paper products over-the-counter medicines hygiene products baby items and more. Normal hours of operation may be found through the Dollar General app.

“At Dollar General we believe the addition of each new store provides positive economic growth for the communities we proudly serve and the addition of our new Coldwater store highlights our commitment to deliver a pleasant shopping experience that includes great prices on quality products in a convenient location” said Matthew Simonsen Dollar General’s senior vice president of real estate and store development.

To commemorate the opening of the new location Dollar General plans to donate 100 new books to a nearby elementary school to benefit students ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade. In partnership with the Kellogg Company the donation will be part of a planned donation of more than 60000 books in fiscal 2022 across the country to celebrate new Dollar General store openings according to a news release.

The addition of the Coldwater store opens the opportunity for schools nonprofit organizations and libraries within a 15-mile radius of the store to apply for Dollar General Literacy Foundation grants. Since its inception in 1993 the Dollar General Literacy Foundation has awarded more than $219 million in grants to nonprofit organizations helping more than 16.1 million individuals take their first steps toward literacy or continued education.

The location of the shooting is one block from Lincoln Elementary School and a route heavily traveled by students walking to and from school however the school had let out several hours earlier than when the incident occurred.

According to police Ali Ortiz street address unavailable shot Sabri Noel 21 once in the abdomen just before 7 p.m.

Police received a call at 6:51 p.m. and found Noel at the scene. He was taken to a regional trauma center and underwent surgery and is listed in critical condition.

For months we've been told that supply chain issues are beginning to ease. The reality however seems to be that logistical challenges are still very much a problem and they aren't going away anytime soon.

Just look at deep-discount retailer Dollar General (DG 0.06%) which continues to get slammed by supply chain disruptions. This causes higher-than-expected distribution and transportation costs. As a result the company will miss earnings expectations and lower guidance for the rest of the year.

Expectations run into reality

This should be a time when Dollar General shines. Rising prices higher interest rates and inflated gas prices mean consumers are looking to stretch their wallets as far as they can. That often means turning to deep discounters like Dollar General.

While the dollar-store chain did say revenue jumped 11.1% to $9.5 billion on a near-7% gain in comparable-store sales profits came in well short of analyst forecasts. This resulted in Dollar General slashing its earnings-growth guidance in half for the fiscal year. New-store openings are now expected to be toward the lower end of the company's prior guidance -- which was lowered last quarter -- as a result.

The new more dour outlook is because Dollar General's supply chain is nowhere near back to normal and the company expects that to continue through at least the fourth quarter. It has its fingers crossed that the damage the supply chain problems are causing will be less than they were in the third quarter.

After all management said last time out that as bad as the supply chain woes were they were seeing ""moderation"" going forward and expected to benefit in the back half of the year as the retailer lapped the significant supply chain inflation it witnessed a year ago. It's clear now that none of that happened or certainly not to the degree promised.

Choking off the supply chain

The biggest problem for Dollar General seems to be not having enough warehouse space to stock items to distribute to its stores. The retailer said it experienced ""unanticipated delays in acquiring additional temporary warehouse space which caused inefficiencies within the Company’s internal supply chain.""

A few years ago Dollar General brought its supply chain in-house through a pair of initiatives called DG Fresh and Fast Track. The purpose was not only to bring more fresh and frozen goods to its stores in a timely fashion but also to implement a new distribution system in its warehouses that pack up goods for shipment based on where they will be unpacked in the store. By having employees touch the merchandise as few times as possible it would speed up the process.

While these initiatives have helped Dollar General improve productivity since they were set up it's clear the broader macroeconomic headwinds the discounter faces were stronger than the efficiencies it planned for and these headwinds are raising its costs.

In particular Dollar General experienced ""materially higher"" costs for things such as late fees for shipping containers because it had to hold onto them longer since it had no place to temporarily put its merchandise. That in turn led to higher temporary storage and transportation costs and labor.

Wait for a discount in Dollar General's stock

Make no mistake -- Dollar General is a solid business and the issues it's facing are endemic to the entire country. While its 31 consecutive year run of same-store sales growth was broken last year due to the difficulty of overcoming the 16% gain in 2020 it's back on track in 2022 to resume its pattern of annual comps increases.

It's a notable achievement for a chain with such a large footprint as Dollar General to keep having customers come back again and again. Few other retailers of any size can hope to boast a similar record.

The higher sales it's seeing which come in part from customers returning to its stores and buying more when they visit shows they still find value at Dollar General. However its supply chain problems mean the retailer is leaving money on the table. While this is a good long-term investment its valuation is at a premium and investors should wait for a better entry point.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9tYW4tZm91bmQtZGVhZC1pbi10YW1wYS1wYXJraW5nLWxvdC1wb2xpY2Utc2F50gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94MTNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbi1mb3VuZC1kZWFkLWluLXRhbXBhLXBhcmtpbmctbG90LXBvbGljZS1zYXkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man found dead in Tampa parking lot next to Family Dollar police say,"article

Tampa police are investigating a homicide after a man’s body was discovered in a Tampa parking lot Sunday morning.

Officers say they were sent to 804 E. Forest Avenue just west of Nebraska Avenue shortly before 8:30 a.m. to investigate a report of a deceased man in an enclosed area of the parking lot. This is adjacent to a Family Dollar store.

When officers arrived they discovered the body of an adult Black man in his mid-forties with upper body trauma.

Charlotte and Angus Buchanan are obsessed with taking baths. So much so the London-based designer couple and cofounders of Buchanan Studio situated their antique tub in the middle of their bathroom. “It’s like this super-luxury lovely thing that you might get in a hotel room” says Angus. Key to the whole arrangement was hiding the shower and toilet from view. That’s how the “sheds” a term coined by the pair’s two children came about. On either side of their Calacatta Viola marble vanity wall are two 8-foot-tall structures clad in dusty pink and white zellige tile concealing the distractions. When the cubicles’ salvaged wood doors (they’re from an old bank) are shut they just look like mini gable-roof houses. “The core concept was driven by a practical issue but I think it feels romantic somehow and it’s unexpected” shares Charlotte.

While their firm’s office is only a 15-minute drive away the Buchanans’ Edwardian townhouse in the Harlesden area of northwest London is a working laboratory. Here they’re free to experiment with fresh materials that they may want to use on future residential projects. Exhibit A: the restaurant-grade stainless steel–everything kitchen. “It’s not a mistake that every commercial kitchen in the world uses [steel]. It’s the most amazing material” says Angus. Skylights overhead and a heated concrete floor underfoot fill the space with warmth from all directions.

The home is also an informal archive of their furniture creations: The dining table on wheels was one of their earliest developments but it was their pillowy Studio Chair that was the first to make it to market in 2020 (the original prototype now lives in her son’s bedroom). “We had no expectation for how successful they’d be. We were like “We might be able to sell some to our friends if it goes really badly” says Charlotte.

But demand for the striped seats went through the roof and ultimately led the couple to designing alternative fabric options like the Ticking Rose print that can be found throughout their home most notably on the curtains that flank the front door. Not wanting any samples of the linen material to go to waste Angus rerigged a small sail for the antique toy boat displayed on the fireplace mantel in the primary bathroom.

Still there were moments during the renovation when the couple had to follow the beat of someone else’s drum—that “someone else” being a local board that authorizes building permits. “In London even if you don’t want to do great big things there’s a lot of hoops to jump through” notes Angus. Two of the main reasons the pair bought the house almost three years ago was the large garden and the opportunity to add a modern extension that would encompass the new kitchen and dining space. Their trusted consultant helped them navigate the process quickly by accruing approval for the square footage in an unconventional manner. “We essentially applied to build lots of little garden sheds individually” explains Charlotte. “Then he said you guys can either build eight sheds or stitch them all together into an extension. You have to play the game.”

The tiny powder room under the stairs (a mainstay in London homes) is a testament to Angus’s DIY skills and his previous career working in set design. After the space was painted pink and red (one of their favorite color combinations) he hot-glued fuzzy red trim onto the wall and mirror. “We had a sample lying around at home and before you knew it it was everywhere” Charlotte says with a laugh. Putting more scraps to use they framed the tiny sink with Delft tile left over from the ones they sourced to line the living room threshold.

The chandelier that hangs over the Studio Ottoman in the formal living area is the product of many hours spent scouring online vintage marketplaces. Turns out it’s really hard to find a Murano glass fixture that’s not colored so Charlotte fittingly describes the moment the builders assembled the light after it was delivered as “terrifying.” “They were hanging [the shades] one by one. We were like please don’t break them. There will be a gap forever!” she says.

The garden extension also encompassed a brand-new bathroom for the kids which the designers saw as an opportunity to go wild with tile. The circa-1960s pink toilet and sink from the Bold Bathroom Company inspired the whimsical checkered layout. “Our daughter was definitely involved” shares Charlotte. (Since then she has overheard her telling her friends about her “princess bathroom.”) Unlike their own retreat this space isn’t intended for relaxing but rather keeping everyone in the family entertained and energized during bath time. “It helps you remember the joy of life even after a stressful workday” says Charlotte.

The Buchanans’ friends have also benefited from the space though they might not know it. “When we’re headed to a dinner and need a last-minute gift we’ll always look at those antique books” says Charlotte. “There’s a niche one on cooking we found for someone; my sister is into science and there was a title in there we picked out for her.” Of course the little library is especially handy when they want something captivating to read while enjoying a soak upstairs.

The four-night run capped off a milestone year for the Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi-led outfit highlighted by the release of the monumental four-part audio-visual epic I Am The Moon.

After kicking off the run by playing the first part of I Am The Moon in its entirety Tedeschi Trucks Band continued to draw from the project while mixing it up with other originals and covers of a broad range of artists from John Prine to Harry Styles. The band selected a few tracks from I Am The Moon: II. Acension including “Playing With My Emotions” “Ain’t That Something” and “La Di Da” for the first set of night two suggesting a pattern the group would abandon by night four. The set also included covers of “Keep On Growing” by Derek and the Dominos and “Done Somebody Wrong” by Elmore James.

Set two featured more covers—”Outside Woman Blues” (Blind Joe Reynolds) “Angel From Montgomery” (John Prine) “Sugaree” (Jerry Garcia) and “Soul Sacrifice” (Santana) among them—as well as a couple tracks from I Am The Moon: IV. Farewell including a set-opening “Last Night in the Rain” and “Where Are My Friends?” and other originals. For the encore the band played “Space Captain” by Matthew Moore.

TTB kept up the pattern on night three including two songs from I Am The Moon: III. The Fall—”Somehow” and “Take Me as I Am”—but only after opening the set with “Don’t Let Me Slide” “Laugh About It” “When Will I Begin” and covers of The Allman Brothers Band‘s “Stand Back” and Mike Mattison‘s “Life Is Crazy”. Set two again featured more covers including “Suzanne” by Leonard Cohen “Gin House Blues” by Bessie Smith “Anyday” by Derek and the Dominos and “I Pity the Fool” by Bobby “Blue” Bland. A triumphant “Bound For Glory” off 2011’s Revelator took the encore position.

The band opened night four with The Beatles‘ “I Got A Feeling” followed by a string of mostly repeats from previous nights including “Playing With My Emotions” “Gravity” “I Am The Moon” and “Pasaquan”. The band closed the set with “River” by Joni Mitchell which it debuted during last year’s Orpheum Theatre residency.

Set two the final set of the run featured additional repeats and some crowd-pleasing covers including the recently debuted “Sign of the Times” by Harry Styles and fan-favorite set closer “Whipping Post” by The Allman Brothers Band. The band capped off the residency—and the year—with a two-song encore both covers: “Fire and Rain” by James Taylor and “Show Me” by Joe Tex

Exclusive: Vulnerable migrants forced to sleep in cold double-decker buses outside Dover centre

Vulnerable migrants were forced to sleep in cold double-decker buses parked outside a processing centre.

The revelation comes in a shocking new report into conditions at a site at Dover.

The Tug Haven centre was so overcrowded detainees slept on board the buses normally used for rail replacement services.

Some including kids were also told to sleep in small tents in freezing conditions.

Campaigner Clare Moseley founder of charity Care4Calais said: “No one in the UK should be sleeping on buses or in tents.”

The Tug Haven centre was set up to photograph and question asylum seekers who had crossed the Channel. It shut in mid-January.

The centre has since been replaced by a facility at the Dover port and a second 20 miles away at Manston Kent. The report by said of its inspection: “Sleeping conditions were extremely crowded and the facilities were deemed far too small.

“During this period those detained slept on thin foam mats... packed so closely together that there was no space between mats and people were practically touching.

“Some detained people slept on double-decker buses. There were also concerns about the temperature on the double-decker buses sometimes used for sleeping.”

Jude Clarke of the Migrant Help said: “Everybody deserves to feel safe and have their human rights protected.”

A government official said: “Since the inspection improvements have been made.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the next 14 years Visa Petrochemicals became a linchpin in an elaborate plan by American chemical giant UCC to discreetly sell its products in India while it evaded criminal trial for spewing lethal gases that killed the residents of Bhopal on the midnight of December 2 1984. A Bhopal court had declared UCC’s then-CEO Warren Anderson a fugitive and ordered that the properties and products of UCC and its subsidiaries all of which were proclaimed offenders and absconders in India for not appearing in the criminal trial against them be seized.

Internal company records accessed by The Reporters’ Collective (TRC) for Al Jazeera now reveal that UCC discreetly sold its products to several firms owned by the federal and state governments and some large private corporations. Among them was a buyer from ground zero: a firm owned by the government of Madhya Pradesh the state whose capital Bhopal saw one of the world’s worst industrial disasters. The firm was a joint venture partner in a cable company that bought UCC products.

To create a discreet backdoor into India where the public saw it as the devil of Bhopal and courts were going after it UCC and its associates floated three firms one each in India the United States and Singapore. In its internal records Carbide employees called them “front” and “dummy” companies. At times they referred to these companies as their “extended arms”. These firms took orders from Indian customers on UCC’s behalf relabelled its products routed them through multiple ports and supplied them to customers. The company sold materials that went into the making of household products ranging from telephone cables to paints.

UCC internally admitted that the dummy companies were “a legal requirement” to help it keep its “distance from India”. This admission was made in an internal business plan for UCC to keep selling its goods in India even after the Indian court had ordered the seizure of all its moveable and immovable assets in the country. The court did not explicitly declare the future sale of UCC products illegal. But it had ordered that all its assets be seized including products and goods meant for sale.

The government companies that traded with UCC knew about this backdoor arrangement as UCC privately informed them when its front company participated in tenders.

This backdoor arrangement continued until 2002 a year after American giant Dow Chemical bought all assets of Carbide for $9.3bn. The period saw Union governments led by both the main Indian parties Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Between 1995 and 2000 the company sold more than 55800 tonnes of wires and cables in the Indian market according to records. In 1999 alone the company sold products worth $24m through this arrangement.

While media in India had reported that Dow relabelled UCC’s products and sold them in the country through a front company for a year the group’s elaborate discreet channels – the network of front and dummy companies – and information on UCC customers including government corporations that knowingly bought products through this shadowy channel had been buried so far. Information on the people behind the dummy companies and their workings – active for almost 14 years – is being published for the first time.

The fountainhead of these revelatory records are documents submitted in a US court hearing when Dow UCC and its dummy companies got into litigation over the pricing of products in the early 2000s and submitted evidence of their relationships.

The collective sent detailed queries to UCC and Dow but did not receive a response.

Lethal business

It was the death of a technician from phosgene poisoning on a cold Christmas eve in 1981 that first foretold an impending catastrophe and revealed cracks in the UCC factory in Bhopal. UCC’s global profits had plummeted 90 percent in the three years preceding the disaster. Its India unit could sell less than half its production capacity of Sevin a “miracle insecticide” born on the banks of the Hudson and reborn in India on the sands of Narmada.

Layoffs took hold and cost-cutting affected safety and maintenance protocols in the Bhopal plant. On the night of the disaster the safety valves and alarm systems of the tank that stored the lethal chemicals including the lethal methyl isocyanate used in the production of Sevin did not work. Some were dysfunctional others were turned off since malfunctioning alarms would repeatedly go off in the leaky plant.

“I remember that night” said 60-year-old Leelabai who lives in Bhopal’s JP Nagar located near the disaster site. At a distance overlooking her one-room house is the metallic carcass of the factory.

“I remember it like yesterday. Our eyes burned and people began vomiting. There was a stampede” she said tearing up. A deadly fog had filled nearby slums. Death struck in seconds and no one was prepared.

Leelabai and her husband were the only survivors in the family. Her three children died over the years as their health debilitated. “Our lives are worse than death” she said.

“None of us knew they had chemicals this dangerous” Savitribai another resident of JP Nagar told TRC.

More than 2000 people died over the following days after breathing a cocktail of deadly fumes one being hydrocyanic acid a chemical that causes a series of reactions leading to loss of blood flow to the brain and resulting in immediate death.

As per estimates by survivors’ groups 13000 people died over the next few years from damaged lungs brains kidneys and nervous and immune systems. Hundreds were disabled for life. The poisonous chemicals polluted (PDF) Bhopal’s soil and water for decades causing a perpetual health tragedy for residents.

Three days after the disaster when Anderson – still one of the West’s most powerful industrial leaders – visited India he was placed under house arrest in UCC’s luxury guesthouse over charges including culpable homicide causing death by negligence. Three hours later Anderson whose factory poisoned a city was released on a bail of 25000 rupees (about $300 at the current exchange rate). Within 24 hours he was mysteriously flown out of Bhopal in state Chief Minister Arjun Singh’s jet and then to the US in the company’s plane. Anderson never returned. He never faced trial. And died peacefully in 2014 aged 92 on US soil where he rose from a salesman in UCC to its CEO.

UCC was still the US’s third-largest chemical manufacturer and 37th among the top 50 US companies in 1984. The Bhopal accident was bad for business. It was a public relations nightmare and would run up several millions in legal costs. UCC had to find a way to continue trade. Who would help the company move past this?

The spin-off

For up to two years after the disaster UCC did its business in India as usual despite protests and outrage from survivors and activists. In December 1987 India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed charges against Anderson UCC and its subsidiary that oversaw Asia operations Union Carbide Eastern which was incorporated in Delaware US. By then UCC had set in motion a series of events that would help retain its grip on the Indian market while keeping a safe distance from courts. The first among them was the birth of Visa Petrochemical Limited.

The company was a “spin off from UCIL [Union Carbide India Limited]” said Visa Petrochemical’s Annual Business Plans submitted to the UCC in 1994. Ravi Muthukrishnan the then India country manager of Dow Chemical noted in an email to his bosses in 2001 that Visa Petrochemical was formed by former UCC employees engaged in “international trade” after the “government advised them to exit totally out of India”. He also noted that Visa whose name was changed to MegaVisa Marketing and Solutions in 1999 was UCC’s “extended arm” into India.

UCC signed an agreement with Visa Petrochemical on 14 November 1987 15 days before the CBI filed charges against the former and designated the new company its “non-exclusive distributor in India”. The arrangement allowed UCC to route its products through Visa. Under the contract Visa’s “duty” was to “canvas and promote sales” of UCC products. It was to do all this while “representing” UCC. The latter’s business could now proceed without the taint of its past.

In the next few years UCC incorporated a new subsidiary – Carbide Asia Pacific – in Delaware which slowly took over the operations of Carbide Eastern an accused party in the Bhopal case. This ensured UCC’s Asia businesses including the agreement with Visa Petrochemicals in India were carried out by a firm not named in the case.

In 1989 UCC paid $470m as compensation for the disaster in response to the civil lawsuit which the survivors’ representatives said was a meagre $500 for each victim and one-sixth of the compensation initially claimed by the government. But the government accepted the proposal without consulting the victims.

In 1992 after all the foreign parties who were accused evaded Indian courts in the criminal lawsuit Bhopal’s chief judicial magistrate seized all of UCC’s moveable and immovable properties in India. It did so after noting: “The accused Union Carbide USA wants to evade the prosecution going on in this court by transferring its properties in India by any means.” The magistrate labelled Anderson UCC (parent company based in the US) and Union Carbide Eastern as “absconders”.

For UCC continuing trade now would be tougher and more complicated than before. UCC and its affiliates had to come up with a new plan.

New partners

In February 1994 a young businessman called Ajay Mittal from Mumbai met UCC officials in Danbury to discuss the shipment of its products. The officials found the meeting with Mittal “excellent” and “frank” as per a fax sent by UCC officials to Mittal a day after their meeting a copy of which was submitted in court documents.

Mittal an American business school graduate is an heir to the realty business family Mittal Group and currently owns and runs Arshiya Limited a logistics and supply chain firm. A 2001 Dow India internal report described his family as a “fairly established group” that owns more than 3000 buildings in Mumbai.

After the court declared UCC an “absconder” and seized its India assets Mittal’s businesses proved crucial in fulfilling Carbide’s “legal requirement to distance from India” reveal company documents.

Mittal owned a firm in Houston called Mega Global Services which was set up in March 1993 documents show. A month later Carbide Asia Pacific terminated its contract with Visa Petrochemicals and on the same day signed a new agreement with Mega Global.

Mega Global Services’ role according to the new contract was to first buy UCC products and resell them to “customers located in India”. UCC’s products would be relabelled as that of Mega Global Services in this process.

Mittal did not stop there. Two months after the meeting in Houston he bought an 89.5 percent stake in Visa Petrochemical. His group now owned both the intermediaries crucial to UCC’s backdoor channel. Mittal UCC and Visa Petrochemicals worked out Carbide products’ route into India which was laid out in an annual business plan of Visa Petrochemical.

Visa Petrochemical would scout for customers. It would pass on formal price queries from potential customers to both Mega Global Services and Union Carbide Asia Pacific. They in turn sent them to the parent UCC which would send the prices to Carbide Asia Pacific. The Asia-Pacific unit would further send that information to Visa Petrochemical which sent it to the customer.

If the buyer agreed it would place the order with Mega Global Services. UCC would sell the product to Mega Global Services. UCC would arrange a third-party transporter known as a “freight forwarder” to ship the goods to the customer according to the agreement. Visa Petrochemical would sign off on an indent – a document listing out the products imported – for the customer.

While the product originated from UCC warehouses the seller on documents given at the Indian port was Mega Global Services for which it earned a commission.

Mega Global Services was referred to as a “front party as a conduit” in internal correspondence. The majority of Mega Global Services’ business revolved around buying and then shipping UCC products as their own.

In 1998 it was replaced by a Singapore firm with a similar name – MegaVisa Solutions Pte Ltd. This too was owned by the Mittal Group.

A July 2001 email by a Dow India manager to his bosses in the US says “MegaVisa Singapore entity was set up to take care of the post-Bhopal situation and is essentially a shell company.”

MegaVisa Singapore bought UCC products in the US “took title to them there and then arranged to ship the products to our customers from there” Sanjiv Sanghvi director at the Singapore firm submitted in a testimony to the US court in 2002.

This Mittal-owned network of “extended arms” and “shells” would ensure UCC’s products continued to be sold in the Indian market from 1993 to 2002. And among its customers were firms owned by the Indian government – the very party that was suing it for causing death and injuries to its citizens.

Government clients

Among UCC’s customers were wholly government-owned firms such as Gas Authority of India Ltd Hindustan Photo Films Manufacturing Company Ltd and Hindustan Cables. Lubrizol India then an equal joint venture between federal government-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and American chemical company Lubrizol was also a customer.

Companies promoted by the governments of Gujarat (Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd) Tamil Nadu (Indian Additives Ltd) and Madhya Pradesh (Vindhya Telelinks Ltd) also bought UCC’s products through the channel. The list of customers also includes more than 150 private firms including Reliance Industries Sterlite Industries Finolex Cables Crompton Greaves Berger Paints and Castrol India.

Many of UCC’s buyers clearly knew who they were shaking hands with. Documents show UCC informed Oil and Natural Gas Company (ONGC) and IOC that the Houston-based Mega Global Services would bid on its behalf for a tender floated by the public sector companies.

“We hereby authorise Mega Global Services to quote against the above [ONGC’s] tender” reads a letter dated November 16 1994 by Carbide Asia Pacific to ONGC’s general manager. Visa Petrochemical’s 1994 Annual Business Plan notes that the company managed a “breakthrough on TEG with ONGC”. TEG or triethylene glycol is a plasticiser chemical for which ONGC invited sellers.

“If MM Global Services is successful in winning the tender” UCC’s December 1999 letter to IOC reads “Union Carbide Corporation will supply the quantity required and the product supplied will meet all the requirements of our specification.”

MegaVisa Singapore submitted a July 2001 sales invoice for an order for methyl isobutyl carbinol worth $77656 by Lubrizol India. Lubrizol India was jointly owned by IOC and Lubrizol.

Visa Petrochemicals which changed its name to MegaVisa Marketing and Solutions worked closely with India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT). “MegaVisa is working with DoT to improve OIT test in the specification” reads one of Visa’s emails to Dow. OIT or oxidative induction time refers to a test to figure out the thermal stability of a wire.

UCC’s Indian front in fact had some level of influence on the government. An internal communication from MegaVisa to Dow from 2001 for example states that “with a lot of groundwork” the company managed to convince the Indian telecom department (DoT) to float a tender for the purchase of a cable product. This is a product that UCC through MegaVisa was supplying to the Indian market. “We need technical support from Dow [the US-based chemical giant had at this point taken over Union Carbide] to push DoT and Utilities for upgradation of specifications” it says in the same note.

“Even in this time of extreme turmoil & hostile environment for our team we have continued to work with DoT” Mittal said in an email to a UCC official on May 5 2000. He also notes that MegaVisa’s work with DoT will help “drive out smaller players”. “As we go ahead we are confident of achieving better volumes and better netbacks for UCC” he wrote.

Correspondence from two private firms – Sterlite and Finolex – show they too knew they were buying UCC products. Both firms sent legal notices to UCC and its subsidiary in the US and Sterlite even filed a civil suit against the company after some orders they placed with UCC’s Houston-based front company Mega Global did not come through. The companies eventually settled the case out of court.

Mittal did not respond to queries from Al Jazeera. An Indian Oil Corporation spokesperson said the company “did not have any comments about the trailing communication”. All the other government and private firms that traded with Carbide’s front companies including the DoT did not respond to Al Jazeera’s queries.

Dow’s takeover

In February 2001 Dow bought UCC. Soon activists demanded that the company come clean on why its fully owned subsidiary never faced trial and pay additional compensation to victims. Dow refused to take ownership of UCC’s liabilities arguing that it never owned the Bhopal plant and that the latter is a separate legal entity.

However Dow also continued trading UCC’s products for a year using its intermediary companies. But it was keen to mask its link to UCC. An email by the company’s public affairs director in March 2001 reads “Reporters will be tempted to keep talking about Union Carbide. But we should discourage reporters from using the words Union Carbide unless it’s a reference to a historical activity.”

In January 2002 Dow (India) informed MegaVisa that it would no longer be the distributor of most UCC products. By this time feedback from at least one Indian customer Berger Paints on MegaVisa’s personnel was not positive – referring to them as “non-committal” documents show. Additionally Dow’s India officials internally recommended that “major customers should be handled directly by Dow”.

MegaVisa in turn held Dow responsible for its losses. A year later Houston- and Singapore-based MegaVisa firms filed a case against Dow and UCC on “antitrust” grounds in the US Connecticut District Court. The MegaVisa firms alleged Dow had gone back on its contractual obligations and hampered its profits.

Dow eventually settled with the Mittal-owned firms out of court including the businesses in Houston Singapore and India. The details of the settlement are not known. UCC’s Indian front MegaVisa filed for liquidation in 2010. Its finances reflect a company that was suffering losses.

The same year the then Congress-led federal government moved India’s top court to change its 1989 order setting the compensation for the disaster’s victims. In its petition it asked the Supreme Court to reconsider that amount and demand additional compensation jointly from UCC Dow and Union Carbide India Limited. At the time the victims’ representatives also demanded that the “corporate veil” of UCC its subsidiaries and Dow be lifted. The case pending for more than a decade was last heard in October 2022 in which the Supreme Court asked the government to include the victims’ demands in its representation.

Twitter owner Elon Musk spoke out on Saturday evening about the so-called “Twitter Files” a long tweet thread posted by journalist Matt Taibbi who had been provided with details about behind-the-scenes discussions on Twitter’s content moderation decision-making including the call to suppress a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden and his laptop.

During a two-hour long Twitter Spaces session Musk said a second “Twitter Files” drop will again involve Taibbi along with journalist Bari Weiss but did not give an exact date for when that would be released. His first drop which was advertised by Musk as a bombshell and ‘awesome’ was instead largely seen as lackluster.

The session which Musk said he had joined from his private jet was rife with technical difficulties.

Musk – who claims to have not read the released files himself – said the impetus for the original tweet thread was about what happened in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election and “how much government influence was there.”

Taibbi’s first thread reaffirmed how in the initial hours after the Post story about Hunter Biden went live Twitter employees grappled with fears that it could have been the result of a Russian hacking operation. It showed employees on several Twitter teams debating over whether to restrict the article under the company’s hacked materials policy weeks before the 2020 election.

While some questioned the basis for the decision others within the company said the circumstances surrounding the story were unclear and recommended caution according to screenshots of internal communications shared by Taibbi.

The emails Taibbi obtained are consistent with what former Twitter site integrity head Yoel Roth told journalist Kara Swisher in an onstage interview last week. Taibbi said the contact from political parties happened more frequently from Democrats but provided no internal documents to back up his assertion. He did not mention whether Democrats requested that Twitter suppress the Post story and his account did not suggest that the US government had pressured Twitter to suppress the story.

Musk on Saturday also criticized the mainstream media for downplaying the “Twitter Files” release while accusing news organizations – particularly the New York Times the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post – of “setting agendas.” In its coverage of the story the Washington Post had concluded “it produced no smoking gun.”

During the wide-ranging session Musk spoke on many other topics including suggesting that US citizens not the government should be able to decide the fate of Edward Snowden the former CIA contractor who leaked intelligence secrets in 2013.

Musk also said Twitter should program and monetize native long audio and video posting. He also mentioned that he met disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in March and that his “BS meter went off” while doubling down on his claim that Twitter never took any investment from Bankman-Fried nor FTX.

Bankman-Fried told Axios last week that he isn’t sure of what happened to the $100 million stake his Alameda Research trading vehicle owned in Twitter. He is quoted as saying that some of the investment may have been sold before Twitter went private in October but he wasn’t sure.

Musk also said that Twitter will roll out its new account verifications within the next week which had been halted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vcGhvdG9zL2luZGlhLW5ld3MvcGhvdG9zLWJob3BhbC1nYXMtdHJhZ2VkeS1jb21wZW5zYXRpb24tcHJvdGVzdC04MzA0MTgxL9IBaGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vcGhvdG9zL2luZGlhLW5ld3MvcGhvdG9zLWJob3BhbC1nYXMtdHJhZ2VkeS1jb21wZW5zYXRpb24tcHJvdGVzdC04MzA0MTgxL2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,38 years on survivors of Bhopal gas tragedy still await ‘just compensation’,"4 / 11

The British government is looking into bringing in the military to mitigate industrial action and keep public services running the chairman of the governing Conservative Party said Sunday after a wave of strikes that were sparked by a cost-of-living crisis and an economy sliding into recession.

The action includes border control and state-run healthcare services if key workers including nurses and ambulance drivers go on strike.

“Our message to the unions is to say this is not a time to strike this is time to try and negotiate. But in the absence of that it’s important for the government it’s the right and responsible thing to do to have contingency plans in place” Conservative Party chairman Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News Sunday.

“We’re looking at the military we’re looking at a specialist response force […] to be able to deal with in the unfortunate circumstance if you do have a strike of border force” Zahawi added.

“Of course in things like driving ambulances other parts of the public sector we’ve got to try and minimize disruption” said Zahawi in response to a question about strikes affecting the UK’s National Health Service.

Zahawi pointed the finger at Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine as the reason for the recent strike action saying the economic struggles were a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine driving up energy costs. He urged unions to drop their demands and “come together” to send a clear message to Putin that he can’t “use energy as a weapon.”

The claim was dismissed by the Royal College of Nursing secretary and chief executive Pat Cullen who insisted the war cannot be used as an excuse for slashing pay for nurses. “Using Russia’s war in Ukraine as a justification for a real-terms pay cut for nurses in the UK is a new low for this Government.

“The public does not believe this kind of rhetoric and wants ministers to address our dispute” she said.

Meanwhile Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Nadhim Zahawi’s allegation that Britain’s nurses ambulance drivers and teachers are allies of Vladimir Putin is as ridiculous as it is disgraceful.”

Strikes have swept the UK this year as workers grapple with a worsening cost-of-living crisis and an economy that is sliding into a recession. CNN Business previously reported that wages have stagnated and failed to keep pace with inflation now at a 41-year high setting the stage for clashes between employers and employees.

Those clashes have already caused widespread disruption including to train travel and are now spreading to even more sectors such as education healthcare and security.

More than 70000 university workers went on strike over pay working conditions and pensions on Thursday November 24 and Friday November 25 at 150 universities across the United Kingdom.

The strike was the biggest in the history of British higher education affecting over 2.5 million students according to the University and College Union which organized the strike.

According to the Office for National Statistics 356000 days were lost to strike action in August not far off the previous high recorded in July 2014 when 386000 days were lost. That number dipped to 205000 in September.

The disruption has continued during autumn with several public service unions set to carry out strike action or ballot their members over pay. Ambulance staff and nurses in the NHS are due to go on strike this month while junior doctors will vote on whether to take industrial action.

RMT Britain’s largest transport union announced in November there would be four 48-hour strikes in December and January.

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) which represents striking postal workers announced additional walkouts on December 9 11 14 15 23 and 24 which could jeopardize Christmas deliveries."

A scientist who worked closely with a US-funded Wuhan lab has claimed that Covid was genetically engineered and leaked from the Chinese facility.

Dr Andrew Huff the former vice president of EcoHealth Alliance called the pandemic 'one of the greatest cover-ups in history' and the 'biggest US intelligence failure since 9/11.'

In his expert opinion whistleblower Huff believes that grant funding provided by Anthony Fauci by way of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to EcoHealth Alliance was linked to the 'creation of SARS-CoV-2.'

He claims NIH '[funded] gain-of-function work and the US intelligence community was aware of and appeared to have been involved' with this work.

Gain-of-function (GOF) work has been widely believed to have created SARS-CoV-2 Huff stressing that it was key in creating the aggressive and contagious disease.

Led by Dr Peter Daszak (left) there were concerns about the ties between Wuhan and EcoHealth Alliance - there most recent grant coming from Anthony Fauci in September 2021

Huff points to China's gain-of-function (GOF) experiments which he believes were carried out within relaxed biosecurity environments and led to the leak at the US-funded Wuhan Institute of Virology

The pandemic swept across the globe and has so far claimed the lives of 6.64 million people after first being reported as a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan China in late 2019.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology a high security lab specializing in coronaviruses has been cast into the spotlight over the past two years many questioning whether it could be the source of the highly contagious disease.

Both China and the lab have vehemently denied allegations but evidence of a lab leak have been gaining traction as scientists researchers and governments hunt for answers.

Experts have suggested Covid may have escaped from the Wuhan facility through an infected researcher improper disposal of waste or potential breaches in security at the site.

In explosive allegations made in his new book The Truth About Wuhan Huff claims that the pandemic was the result of the US government funding of dangerous genetic engineering of coronaviruses in China.

Speaking to The Sun Huff said that 'the US government is to blame for the transfer of dangerous biotechnology to the Chinese.'

He points to China's GOF experiments which he believes were carried out within relaxed biosecurity environments which led to a lab leak at the US-funded Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Huff said that it shouldn't be a surprise that China lied about the outbreak and then went to 'extraordinary lengths to make it appear as if the disease emerged naturally'

In September Fauci who has spent over five decades in the federal government and has been the face of the coronavirus pandemic response awarded EcoHealth more money

'EcoHealth Alliance and foreign laboratories did not have the adequate control measures in place for ensuring proper biosafety biosecurity and risk management ultimately resulting in the lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology' he said.

The army veteran from Michigan said the organization taught the Wuhan lab the 'best existing methods to engineer bat coronaviruses to attack other species' for many years.

'China knew from day one that this was a genetically engineered agent' he said.

'I was terrified by what I saw. We were just handing them bioweapon technology.'

In his book the infectious diseases expert claims 'greedy scientists killed millions of people globally' and goes as far as to claim the US government covered it all up.

Huff said that it shouldn't be a surprise that China lied about the outbreak and then went to 'extraordinary lengths to make it appear as if the disease emerged naturally.'

'The shocking part of all of this is how the United States government lied to all of us' he said.

The organization received a $653392 grant to analyze 'the potential for future bat coronavirus emergence in Myanmar Laos and Vietnam'

EcoHealth Alliance had been studying different coronaviruses in bats for more than ten years with funding from the NIH - and developed close working ties with the Wuhan lab.

In September Anthony Fauci who has spent over five decades in the federal government and has been the face of the coronavirus pandemic response awarded EcoHealth more money.

The organization received a $653392 grant to analyze 'the potential for future bat coronavirus emergence in Myanmar Laos and Vietnam' according to the Wall Street Journal.

NIH have identified the region as 'high risk for future emergence of novel coronaviruses and the potential site where SARS-CoV-2 first 'spilled over' from bats to people.'

While the NIH is promoting EcoHealth Alliance's claim that Covid-19 emerged through a 'spill over' from animals.

Many scientists disagree and have said the circumstantial and biological evidence suggests a lab leak.

Huff who worked at EcoHealth Alliance from 2014 to 2016 serving as vice president from 2015 said he worked on the classified side of the research program as a US government scientist.

Former intelligence chiefs and diplomats have already claimed Covid was leaked from a Wuhan lab in the 'cover-up of the century.'

America's former top diplomat in East Asia David Stilwell telling The Sun in September 2021 that 'this makes Watergate look easy.'

'People are for some reason bent on insisting on having a slam-dunk air-tight case that China produced this virus' he said at the time.

'Of course the PRC is not going to let you in there to see their labs but so many people have used that problem to stop further inquiry.

'This isn't a legal case we are not looking for indisputable evidence; there is enough circumstantial evidence.'

In 2019 the Wuhan lab started working with the EcoHealth Alliance on a USAID program called PREDICT which focuses on emerging pandemic threats.

PREDICT had been designed to detect and find zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential – including coronaviruses.

EcoHealth Alliance states on their website that zoonotic diseases–those that can be transmitted between animals and humans–represent approximately 75 percent of the newly emerging diseases currently affecting people.

Shi Zhengli the Wuhan virologist who famously became known as 'Batwoman' had hoped the program would create an early-warning system for pandemics.

Huff said he has no proof that the leak was deliberate however does claim in his explosive tell-all book that biosecurity at the Chinese facility was compromised

Huff alleges the US were using the project to assess the bioweapon capabilities of foreign labs - including the Wuhan Institute of Virology

But in 2014 Huff was asked to review a funding proposal which revealed that GOF work was being carried out to create SARS-CoV-2 - which causes Covid.

GOF work sees viruses accelerated to more easily infect humans to help researchers test scientific theories develop new technologies and find treatments for infectious diseases.

The risky research method can pose safety and security concerns - and is banned in many countries.

It was originally banned in the US in 2014 but was reintroduced by the NIH in 2017.

Huff realized the EcoHealth Alliance was working closely with the Wuhan lab on this type of research with the support of USAID - a US government department.

He claims that the virus would never occur in nature and had been developed into a much more powerful pathogen in the lab.

'EcoHealth Alliance developed SARS-CoV-2 and was responsible for the development of the agent SARS-CoV-2 during my employment at the organization' he said.

He said that he has no evidence China deliberately released the virus but believes the US-funded project was 'mostly a global fishing expedition for coronaviruses' to carry out GOF work or for intelligence collection - rather than preventing future pandemics.

'At the time I felt like the project seemed more like intelligence collection than scientific research and development' he said in his book.

The scientist said the PREDICT program wasn't collecting the data it should have been and Huff told The Sun that it appeared to be a 'giant intelligence operation'.

He alleges the US were using the project to assess the bioweapon capabilities of foreign labs - including the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Huff claims the US-funded project was 'mostly a global fishing expedition for coronaviruses' to carry out GOF work or for intelligence collection - rather than preventing future pandemics

The pandemic swept across the globe and has so far claimed the lives of 6.64 million people after first being reported as a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan China in late 2019

Shortly after a novel coronavirus was eventually identified the first case outside China recorded in January 2020 in Thailand

During a meeting with top executives in 2015 and 2016 Huff claims that he tried to sound the alarm over the biosafety and biosecurity risks in contract labs.

'I was concerned that EcoHealth Alliance did not have enough visibility or firsthand knowledge of what was happening at foreign laboratories contracted and managed by EcoHealth Alliance' he said.

Huff said US government officials again issued warnings in January 2018 about the Wuhan lab - including the major shortage of experts needed to safely manage research on deadly coronaviruses.

'It could be reasonably argued that EcoHealth Alliance set up China to fail' he said.

And when Covid emerged in late 2019 he said China 'and some of their US government collaborators at the Department of State USAID and the Department of Defense went into full cover-up mode.'

What did Fauci get wrong? From telling people not to wear masks to claiming vaccines stopped infections Dr Anthony Fauci is due to step down from his position as one of America's top infectious disease advisors at the end of this year. Below are listed some of his key blunders when the virus struck Don't wear masks do wear masks As global concern for Covid was surfacing in March 2020 Fauci told Americans that there was 'no need' to wear a face mask. He said they may only help people 'feel a little better' and 'might even block a droplet' — but would not provide good protection. Less than a month later he was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after it emerged the virus spread via droplets in the air. Dr Fauci later insisted he advised people not to wear masks to ensure there were enough available for hospitals and healthcare centers. Covid did not come from a lab Dr Fauci has also repeatedly insisted that Covid did not leak from a lab in China. He called the theory a 'shiny object that will go away' and brushed aside claims from other top experts as an 'opinion'. Dr Fauci has now backpedalled saying instead that he keeps an 'open mind' although insisting that it remains 'most likely' that the virus spilled over from animals to humans. Two jabs will stop you catching Covid When the Covid vaccine roll-out was in full swing Dr Fauci said the immunity from shots made doubly-vaccinated people a 'dead end' for the virus and even suggested they may no longer need to wear masks. Schools shutdown Schools were closed from March through to August 2020 something Dr Fauci later expressed regret about. But he said last month that he 'should have realized' there would be 'deleterious collateral consequences'. Children are now bearing the brunt of the US's tripledemic after lockdowns left them without proper immune defense. Funding Wuhan lab In 2014 Dr Facui's agency issued a $3.7million grant to EcoHealth Alliance which some allege was used to support gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).

Huff said he believes that the US government was alerted to the outbreak in August or October of 2019 months before the first clusters were starting to emerge.

He quit EcoHealth Alliance in 2016 'due to a large number of ethical concerns with the scientific work and EcoHealth Alliance as a whole.'

But in late 2019 he was suddenly offered a position at Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) - and was told he would need top security clearance and a polygraph for the job.

Huff now believes he was approached for the role to keep him quiet about the origins of Covid.

'It is my belief that people working within the US government potentially identified me as a risk to knowing first-hand that the SARS-CoV-2 disease emergence event was a consequence of the US government's sponsorship of the genetic engineering of SARS-CoV-2 domestically and abroad' he said in his book.

'If I would have accepted the position then I suspect that DARPA would have disclosed restricted information to me which would have consequently prevented me from discussing any of this information publicly like I have been and am doing now.'

About a month after the pandemic began in the early months of 2020 Huff said he was 'adamant that SARS-CoV-2 was a manmade agent.'

'I suddenly realized what the potential motivation and persistence for recruiting me were' he said.

'The intelligence community realized that I was the only person in a senior position that had left EHA and the fact I was working outside the government's control made me a threat to their agenda.'

Huff believes government officials offered him the role so he could be 'sworn into silence for the rest of my life.'

As he began to unravel the alleged cover-up by the US government he claims that authorities have launched a massive campaign of harassment against him.

He claimed military-grade drones would often appear at his home he was stalked at the supermarket and he was followed by unknown vehicles.

Huff has since filed a lawsuit with Renz Law LLC against EcoHealth Alliance in the state of New York.

In September Huff tweeted: 'Below is link to the copy of the report about the REAL Origin of SARS-CoV2 sent to the US Senate and Congress.

'My declaration in the document was provided under oath with penalty of perjury.'

The document issued by Renz Law LLC states: 'Donald Trump Senator Ron Johnson Senator Rand Paul Rep. Jim Jordan and others were right.

'As early as later April or early May 2020 former President Trump spoke of the creation of SARS-CoV-2 in a lab in Wuhan China.

'Since that time both the investigation and the cover-up have continued but the evidence provided herein clearly demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 was indeed created in a lab in Wuhan China by EcoHealth Alliance and with funding from Anthony Fauci's NIH/NIAID.

The document goes on to say that the evidence gathered hopes to back five statements of claim.

'SARS-CoV-2 was created in lab in Wuhan China Anthony Fauci funded the creation of SARS-CoV-2 and lied to Congress about funding gain-of-function work the US intelligence community was aware of and appeared to have been involved with the funding of said gain-of-function work' it read.

'A number of well-connected public and private partners were involved in gain-of-function work that resulted in the creation and release of SARS-CoV-2 and Anthony Fauci and other coordinated to cover-up the funding of the gain-of-function work which resulted in SARS-CoV-2.'

It goes on to say that the expectations are that there will be a 'immediate investigation that will see bi-partisan support in light of this newly compiled information.'

'Renz Law and Make Americans Free Again (MAFA) will provide any and all support possible in such an investigation and prosecutions' the document continues.

Official records show EcoHealth Alliance has received seven grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since June 2020 for research into animal-borne viruses in Asia and Africa

'Further with the additional high-profile revelations that certain segments of the government have promoted censoring this information presumably as part of the cover up we will voluntarily support any good faith efforts by the media to correct the record.

'[We] will continue to seek truth and justice in this matter for all that have been impacted by the worst man-made pandemic in human history.'

Huff provided a declaration alongside the documents stating that he would attest a true and accurate representation of facts and experiences.

In October DailyMail.com revealed that EcoHealth Alliance had been handed nearly $7 million in taxpayer's money during the pandemic.

Official records show EcoHealth Alliance has received seven grants from the NIH since June 2020 for research into animal-borne viruses in Asia and Africa.

Four of those grants were handed to the non-profit after it was uncovered EcoHealth Alliance channeled funds to the Chinese laboratory in Wuhan the epicenter of the pandemic.

It also collaborated on controversial virus-tinkering research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology which some scientists fear led to the Covid crisis.

Dr Peter Daszak a British zoologist who was accused of trying to cover-up serious inquiry into the so-called lab leak theory is listed as the project lead on a majority of the research programs.

Tennessee Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn told DailyMail.com: 'EcoHealth Alliance has still not answered key questions about its role in the pandemic.

'They should be held to account and not be receiving taxpayers' dollars until a full investigation is complete.'

Who IS Peter Daszak? The frog-focused zoologist and friend of Dr Anthony Fauci One of the most stringent deniers of the man-made hypothesis is British zoologist Dr Peter Daszak (pictured) who is known among friends as a 'funny northerner' but considered a potential orchestrator of the pandemic by advocates of the lab-leak theory The debate around the origins of Covid has been ongoing since the virus first began causing chaos in early 2020. Some top virologists believe the coronavirus spread to humans from an infected animal potentially in a wet market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Others think it leaked from a secretive laboratory in the same city. Whether or not it was deliberate or accidental is an even more contentious part of the 'lab leak' theory. One of the most stringent deniers of the man-made hypothesis is British zoologist Dr Peter Daszak who is known among friends as a 'funny northerner' but considered a potential orchestrator of the pandemic by advocates of the lab-leak theory. He became renowned for his role in facilitating 'risky' coronavirus research in China through EcoHealth Alliance the non-profit he is president of. The New York-based organisation has secured $60million (£53million) of US Government funds for scientific research over the past decade. Some of this cash it has emerged has since ended up in the pocket of researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) the lab at the centre of lab leak claims. Some of this research involved manipulating Covid-like viruses. Now it has been revealed that EcoHealth Alliance has gained another $650000 (£580000) from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to trawl through caves in Southeast Asia looking for bats carrying coronaviruses despite fears similar work sparked the pandemic. The new contract gives the green light to project leader Dr Daszak and his team to analyse the behaviour and environmental risk factors for coronaviruses to spillover into humans from animals. It warns that that part of the world has a 'high diversity of wildlife coronaviruses' and a large proportion of the population is regularly exposed to wildlife that could be infected. Myanmar Laos and Vietnam are particularly high risk according to the project details published by the US National Institutes of Health. Over the course of five years the team will identify cases where people become infected with coronaviruses assess the risk and drivers of community transmission and spread and test public health interventions to contain an outbreak. Scientists argue such research is vital to contain diseases like Covid. But others have raised alarm over its potential involvement in outbreaks. The latest contract puts the spotlight back on Dr Daszak who hails from the mining town Dukinfield on the outskirts of Manchester. The researcher who grew up with a younger brother Ukrainian father and Welsh mother studied zoology at the University of Bangor in Wales and the University of East London. The expert in zoonosis — the spread of viruses from animals to humans — has authored more than 300 scientific papers over his career which has spanned more than three decades and seen him become friendly with Dr Anthony Fauci chief medical advisor to the US President. Dr Daszak who lives in New York with his wife Janet joined EcoHealth — formerly The Wildlife Trust — in 2001. His early career focused on diseases spread by frogs. But he has also worked with researchers in China for 15 years including Dr Shi Zhengli a virologist at the WIV nicknamed 'Bat Woman'. EcoHealth which originally focused on conservation now works around the world to find out the origins of viruses map where they have spread and analyse them to find out where the next outbreak could occur. Records show Dr Daszak raked in millions of dollars' worth of grants from US Government bodies on behalf of EcoHealth alliance and was paid $354000 (£314000) in 2019. This funding was often dished out to other laboratories including the WIV to conduct research in mines to examine bat coronaviruses. The partnership saw researchers sample thousands of bats and determine that Sars originated in horseshoe bats which are common in southern and central China and traded in wet markets. And two years before Covid emerged Dr Daszak proposed working with WIV scientists to alter coronaviruses and release them into bats as part of a plan to inoculate them against the virus.

The most recent NIH grant awarded to EchoHealth Alliance came on September 21. The $653392 package went towards studying Covid-like viruses in bats across Asia and Africa.

That five-year experiment will likely investigate 'the potential for future bat coronavirus emergence' with scientists set to trawl caves in Myanmar Laos and Vietnam in the hunt to prevent another viral crisis.

Senator Joni Ernst an Iowa Republican told DailyMail.com: 'Giving taxpayer money to EcoHealth to study pandemic prevention is like paying a suspected arsonist to conduct fire safety inspections.'

Daszak is a close friend of the US' top Covid doctor Fauci and even thanked him for publicly downplaying theories that Covid may have been created in a lab.

EcoHealth Alliance has been receiving federal research funding since 2002.

Daszak who has maintained the view that the coronavirus jumped to humans from animal reservoirs has a checkered history when it comes to the kind of research that his critics argue helped pave the way for highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 to escape the safety of a lab.

He has been slammed by Republicans in Congress for taking part in GOF research.

Those who believed there was a chance the virus escaped from the WIV were cast aside as fringe thinkers in part due to Daszak's influence in the community of epidemiologists and infectious disease experts.

He and fellow infectious disease experts Ralph Baric and Linfa Wang circulated a statement that was later published in The Lancet in which 27 prominent scientists from nine countries to strongly condemned 'conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.'

But Daszak appeared to want to distance himself from the letter after a Freedom of Information Request revealed that he and his fellows 'should not sign this statement so it has some distance from us and therefore doesn't work in a counterproductive way.'

Dr Richard Horton editor of The Lancet said in December 2021 that it took 16 months to publish an official conflict of interest statement in which he revealed Daszak had links to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Despite charges of having a conflict of interest given that his organization had worked with the WIV on coronavirus research in the past Daszak was appointed to the World Health Organization's team charged with going to China to investigate the origin of the virus.

The WHO dispelled those claims though saying that 'all declared interests were assessed and found not to interfere with the independence and transparency of the work.'

Officials in the Trump and Biden administrations have said the Chinese government worked to thwart investigations into the origins of the virus and hoodwinked WHO investigators when they arrived.

Daszak revealed in March 2021 that he and the team took China's word for it when officials there insisted that the virus could not have escaped from their lab.

'We met with them. We said 'Do you audit the lab?' And they said 'Annually.' 'Did you audit it after the outbreak?' 'Yes.' 'Was anything found?' 'No.' 'Do you test your staff?' 'Yes.' No one was —' Daszak said.

In response to Lesley Stahl who said he was taking the Chinese researcher's word for it Daszak said 'Well what else can we do?'

'We asked them tough questions. They weren't vetted in advance. And the answers they gave we found to be believable correct and convincing' Daszak said.

In April 2020 former President Donald Trump chose to axe Daszak's grant awarded in 2019 over unsubstantiated claims that the virus leaked from the Wuhan lab that employs a Chinese virologist who had been receiving funding from the grant.

'NIH got it right when it canceled the funding for the experiments EcoHealth Alliance was conducting with China's state-run Wuhan Institute' Ernst said.

She added 'In addition to violating multiple federal laws EcoHealth has still not turned over documents about these dangerous studies that NIH has requested on multiple occasions that could offer vital clues to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.'",,,,,,,,,,,,

(AP) — Two power substations in a North Carolina county were damaged by gunfire in what is being investigated as a criminal act causing damage that could take days to repair and leaving tens of thousands of people without electricity authorities said Sunday.

In response to ongoing outages which began just after 7 p.m. Saturday across Moore County officials announced a state of emergency that included a curfew from 9 p.m. Sunday to 5 a.m. Monday. Also county schools will be closed Monday.

“An attack like this on critical infrastructure is a serious intentional crime and I expect state and federal authorities to thoroughly investigate and bring those responsible to justice” Gov. Roy Cooper wrote on Twitter.

Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields said at a Sunday news conference that authorities have not determined a motivation. He said someone pulled up and “opened fire on the substation the same thing with the other one.”

“No group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept that they’re the ones that done it” Fields said adding “we’re looking at all avenues.”

The sheriff noted that the FBI was working with state investigators to determine who was responsible. He also said “it was targeted.”

“It wasn’t random” Fields said.

Fields said law enforcement is providing security at the substations and for businesses overnight.

“We will have folks out there tonight around the clock” Fields said.

Roughly 36000 electric customers in the county were without power on Sunday evening according to poweroutage.us.

With cold temperatures forecast for Sunday night the county also opened a shelter at a sports complex in Carthage.

Duke Energy spokesman Jeff Brooks said multiple pieces of equipment were damaged and will have to be replaced. He said while the company is trying to restore power as quickly as possible he braced customers for the potential of outages lasting days.

“We are looking at a pretty sophisticated repair with some fairly large equipment and so we do want citizens of the town to be prepared that this will be a multiday restoration for most customers extending potentially as long as Thursday” Brooks said at the news conference.

Dr. Tim Locklear the county’s school superintendent announced classes will be canceled Monday.

“As we move forward we’ll be taking it day by day in making those decisions” Locklear said.

The Pilot newspaper in Southern Pines reported that one of its journalists saw a gate to one of the substations had been damaged and was lying in an access road.

GREENSBORO N.C. — Update: Gov. Roy Cooper speaks as thousands are without power in Moore County.

Duke Energy manages more than 32000 miles of transmission lines across several states that feed into one of their 5000 substations.

These facilities reduce the voltage from higher transmission lines to a safe voltage to power homes and businesses.

""We understand that we are critical infrastructure and said we do incorporate multiple layers of security at all of our facilities and across our system"" said Duke Energy Spokesperson Jeff Brooks.

Brooks was not able to detail exactly what those layers of security include.

But adds even if their equipment is intentionally damaged they have plans in place to get the power restored as quickly as possible.

""We have to plan for it and we do plan for this. This is part of our protocol this is part of our planning and we are working the plan now"" said Brooks.

Brooks says deliberate acts like the one in Moore County create a bigger challenge than the weather outages that are pretty normal.

That's why it could take up to three days to get lights back on for everyone.

""We are looking at a pretty sophisticated repair with some fairly large equipment"" said Brooks.

According to Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields multiple gunshots took down two Duke Energy Substations before 8 p.m. Saturday.

Initially leaving more than 37000 Duke Energy customers and nearly 3000 Randolph EMC customers in the dark.

""We've been in the dark figuratively and literally for 24 hours now. A lot of people watching from outside of Moore county might know about what's happening that we don't here"" said Andrew Wilkins.

Vandals put plans for Wilkins and his family on hold.

The Moore County native was in town to celebrate a late Thanksgiving with his parents.

Instead of cooking they are huddling by the fire to stay warm.

""It's frustrating it's unfortunate frankly it's some levels infuriating. We can plan for natural disasters. But in this case people didn't get any runway at all to get ready for this"" said Wilkins.

In a press conference on Sunday afternoon Sheriff Fields also shared the struggles this incident will cause the citizens and businesses of Moore county just three weeks before Christmas.

""We're just getting over COVID and now this and how it's going to hurt all of our restaurants and the businesses and stuff so it's going to hurt"" said Sheriff Fields.

The Moore County Sheriff's office will have additional security at all of their substations offer the coming days.

WFMY did reach out to local law enforcement about added security measures in our area including the Guilford County Sheriff's office Alamance County Sheriff's office and the Greensboro Police Department.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYXlvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8xMi8wNC9kb3dudG93bi1zb3V0aGVybi1waW5lcy1kYXJrLWVtcHR5LWFtaWRzdC1wb3dlci1vdXRhZ2VzLzEwODM1NDY0MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTOS: Downtown Southern Pines is dark empty amidst power outages,"NEWS

The king of comedy made his triumphant return to the stage this week kicking off his first tour in over a decade.

Advert

And as you can imagine demand for tickets was fierce when they went on sale a few weeks ago with people queuing up - virtually of course - for hours to get their hands on them.

It was worse than Glastonbury.

So it should come as no surprise that off the back of his return some people out there have seen an opportunity to make a little bit of money out of the excitement.

eBay

Fans who've managed to bag themselves some tickets have been seen reselling them for hundreds of pounds.

Advert

One listing on eBay is advertising four tickets for £1600 while another is flogging a pair for £399.

You've got to really love him if you're daft enough willing to pay that much to see him.

I mean you could just log onto Twitter for five minutes and see the entire gig tbh.

Not everyone is falling for it though with some sharing their utter disgust at people trying to make a handsome profit out of it.

Advert

Blasting the touts one user said: ""Absolutely disgusting been trying to get peter kay tickets been on ticket port waiting list now been told the only tickets available are 300 pounds each.""

While another wrote: ""Loads of scummy touts on @Twitter selling Peter Kay tickets.""

eBay

Kay performed the first gig of his mammoth tour in Manchester last night (2 December) with a packed house at the AO Arena.

Advert

Fans chanted his name as he arrived on stage bringing the Bolton comic to tears.

After composing himself Kay told the audience: ""How am I supposed to do comedy now? You'll have me in bits... I can't believe you made me cry.""

Members of the audience from the show have since revealed that Kay's routine is as good as ever with jokes focusing on ordinary and relatable topics that you might not think twice about until Kay points out just how ridiculous they are.

One fan Olivia Matthews told BBC News there was 'nothing too serious' in his routine adding: ""Everything's light-hearted. That's what we like about him. His last tour was 12 years ago and we were 10 or 11 so we're a new audience coming into it. I've always known him and always liked him growing up. We've got to see his material but never live.""

Advert

Another member of the crowd 63-year-old Paul Stokes said Kay was 'a little bit overwhelmed when he first came out' but assured the comedian was 'excellent'.

His tour also includes a monthly residency at London's O2 arena set to run at least until February 2025.

Holiday office parties are back.

After two years of pandemic shut downs and distancing Twin Cities companies are shoving aside worry and rolling out celebratory red carpets instead.

The holiday teas at the exquisitely decorated St. Paul Hotel are sold out and ""we are getting a lot of ticket sales"" for showings of its annual live December radio show ""It's a Wonderful Life"" said Leslie Ingiald the hotel's director of sales and marketing.

Ingiald said the past two years of show and party cancellations mask mandates and vaccination checks have been hard on employees.

Kim Ly Curry (left) and Shawn Rodgers sampled perspective holiday dishes at D’Amico Catering’s Holiday Showcase event in September 2022 at Loring Social in Minneapolis. D’Amico used the event to introduce new dishes that clients could serve if they decided to bring back their annual holiday parties in 2022.

""It will be a big relief and much more fun [to party this year]. It's already definitely much more of a joyful holiday season"" she said.

That sentiment is echoing statewide as employers inject some fun — and financial heft — into the holidays after fretful years characterized by empty restaurants unemployed chefs and restaurant workers as well as worries over the war in Ukraine inflation and lurking COVID-19 variants.

To be sure COVID-19 is still around but its punch is lessening. So holiday elves are busy stringing lights and polishing cocktail glasses while caterers bartenders and restaurants eagerly await the buzz of cash registers. No one group tracks exact numbers but event planners and chamber officials generally agree that holiday parties funnel millions into Minnesota's economy.

That's why it hurt when D'Amico Catering had to furlough all employees in 2020. But now 250 workers are back catering 100 revived holiday parties in clients' offices and venues such as the Mill City Museum Walker Art Center Metropolitan Ballroom McNamara Alumni Center and Loring Park's Café and Bar Lurcat.

""The corporate holiday party is in fact back"" said Christie Altendorf D'Amico Catering's senior event planner. ""We have been waiting a really long time to say that.""

Corporations generally spend $50 to $250 per holiday guest depending on whether it's an intimate function an office luncheon or an extravagant affair Altendorf said.

Holiday revenue is a lifeline especially during the slow pre-wedding months of January February and March said D'Amico operations director Cathy Bovard. ""To have those type of holiday events back is not only important financially [for the company] but for the retention of workers.""

Things tilted toward normal earlier this year. In September D'Amico held a winter tasting event during which Fortune 500 clients could try new dishes that might tempt their holiday party planning instincts.

""We definitely were getting a sense that our corporate partners were looking at possibly getting events budgets together again"" Altendorf said. ""We saw that was an opportunity.""

And why not?

""Who doesn't love office parties?"" said Joe Spencer president of the St. Paul Downtown Alliance. ""My inbox has a fair number of holiday parities so from my perspective it feels like we are 80% back to 'normal.'""

The 1600-member St. Paul Area Chamber which counts Ecolab 3M Medtronic Securian Financial Travelers Xcel Energy and others among its members is bringing back its Holiday Chamber Connect extravaganza a $5000 event that traditionally has 900 guests sampling donated fare from St. Paul's finest chefs.

""Two years ago we canceled. Last year we had it small and masked"" with about 200 guests said the Chamber's marketing vice president Megan Ryan. ""This year we are indeed returning to our tradition at the Landmark Center … [and] are expecting 400 to 500 guests.""

Cheer is similarly bubbling in Minneapolis.

""No 'bah humbug' to be found here"" said Steve Cramer CEO of the Minneapolis Downtown Council. ""The restaurants we talk to are seeing a big increase in restaurant booking for holiday gatherings and private events.""

Separately downtown human resource leaders told the council they are reviving Christmas and New Year celebrations as a way to reconnect remote workers and restore office culture.

""This [holiday party] is seen as [one] of the ways to encourage people to come in and be together"" Cramer said.

Gordon Braun a managing director at internal audit and IT consulting firm Protiviti said his 110 Minneapolis staffers will have a pot luck in December and a fancy holiday party in January at the Walker Art Center.

It's the first big get-together since the pandemic started and the first with spouses.

""Our people are excited and looking forward to it after a couple of years of hiatus"" Braun said noting that they are expecting to spend more than $10000. ""We see this as a good investment. Our culture is real important.""

Restauranteur Erik Forsberg is seeing that same sentiment prevail at his Dan Kelly's Broadway Pizza and Devil's Advocate in downtown Minneapolis and Joseph's Family Restaurant in Stillwater. Each have two company holiday parties or happy hours booked for customers such as Ameriprise SPS Henson Efron and other law firms through December and January. More reservation inquiries land daily.

""The everyday business is not back yet. That is why these parties are so important for us"" Forsberg said.

Three blocks from the Devil's Advocate on Nicollet Mall the IDS Tower has put up lights and Christmas trees in its Crystal Court and announced holiday concert dates for the month of December. Nearby the Capella Tower recently sent invitations to tenants for its live holiday party on Dec. 6. Blocks away the managers at the new Four Seasons Hotel in the RBC Gateway tower are also making party plans.

Zach Sussman co-founder of the social club and workspace Brick x Mortar on First Avenue held its first holiday movie night for business members Nov. 27 and has more company parties booked in December and January.

""We are really happy about it obviously"" Sussman said. ""Last year was pretty slow to come back. … Now people are comfortable being in public spaces again.""

Or as the St. Paul Hotel's Ingiald summed it up: ""Now we can just go back to celebrating.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Answered,"The Callisto Protocol is a brand-new horror title that bears a lot of similarities to the extremely popular Dead Space series from Electronic Arts. You might wonder “So is this supposed to be a Dead Space sequel of some sort?” The short answer is: no The Callisto Protocol is not a sequel to the Dead Space franchise. The long(er) answer? Well simply continue reading below to find out more about this new sci-fi horror game.

Make Us Whole: Dead Space and The Callisto Protocol’s Connections

Way back in early 2006 when Visceral Games was still called EA Redwood Studios developers Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey spearheaded a project called Rancid Moon a horror game heavily inspired by the Capcom hit Resident Evil 4 and taking clues from the System Shock series as well as various sci-fi horror movies such as Event Horizon and Solaris. The team is eager to prove themselves capable of making original titles instead of keeping working on licensed projects.

Pleased by the prototype running on an original Xbox EA executives then gave the green light and long story short Dead Space was born. This tale of Isaac Clarke facing off against horrifying cosmic abominations instantly became a hit in 2008 raking in 86-89 critics’ scores on Metacritic and 1.4 million copies sold on PS3 Xbox 360 and PC in a year.

EA Redwood then transformed into Visceral Games a year after the successful launch — but at the same time Schofield and Condrey also went their own way. Not being a part of Dead Space 2 development they left Visceral and created the Sledgehammer Games development studio (recent Call of Duty games co-developer team) instead. The Dead Space IP is still held by EA.

Years later with the lackluster reception to Dead Space 3 Isaac Clarke’s fate seems to have been lost in the cold void of space. Nevertheless Schofield now leading PUBG Studios and Krafton’s Striking Distance development team in 2019 is eager to come back to making space horror-themed games. The time is ripe apparently since the battle royale makers are also looking to expand their PUBG portfolio… much to the chagrin of gamers all over the world.

“The funny thing is I came in with this story when I went and met with the PUBG people for the first time and started talking about [The Callisto Protocol] and building a studio. I presented this game to them and so what we did was we made it fit within the PUBG storyline.” – Glen Schofield on The Callisto Protocol idea via IGN.

However this year on May 26 2022 Schofield confirmed that the game’s narrative became “too out there” to be connected with PUBG and evolved into its own standalone world. He also promised to add “little surprises” for the battle royale title fans.

So there you have it. Again no The Callisto Protocol is not a sequel to the Dead Space franchise. And yes if you’re curious it no longer has anything to do with PUBG.

Death Is Only the Beginning: Dead Space Developers Who Worked on The Callisto Protocol

Even so this game still carries the DNA of its predecessor worthy to be called a spiritual successor. From theme visual and gameplay elements to development staff. There are at least four key figures in the development of the Dead Space series who made The Callisto Protocol into reality:

Glen Schofield: Dead Space co-creator.

Steve Papoutsis: Dead Space senior producer and Dead Space 2 executive producer.

Scott Whitney: Dead Space video post-production director and designer.

Christopher Stone: Dead Space animation director.

According to Schofield himself of Striking Distance’s 150 employees 25 to 30 former Visceral Games and Sledgehammer Games developers were also involved in the creation of The Callisto Protocol.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amgen Inc's experimental obesity drug demonstrated promising durability trends in an early trial paving the way for a larger mid-stage study early next year company officials said ahead of a data presentation on Saturday.

The small Phase I trial found that patients maintained their weight loss for 70 days after receiving the highest tested dose of the injected drug currently known as AMG133.

Amgen shares have gained about 5% since the company said on Nov. 7 that 12 weeks of trial treatment at the highest monthly dose of AMG133 resulted in mean weight loss of 14.5%.

At 150 days after the last dose maintained weight loss had dropped to 11.2% below original weight at the start of the trial according to findings detailed at a meeting of World Congress of Insulin Resistance Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease in Los Angeles.

Patients treated with AMG133 did have side effects including nausea and vomiting but most cases were mild and resolved within a couple of days after the first dose Amgen said.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more that 40% of the U.S. population is obese costing nearly $173 billion annually. It is a primary cause of type 2 diabetes and been linked to heart disease certain cancers and other health complications such as more severe COVID-19.

The weight loss field has gained renewed medical and investor attention in recent months after diabetes drugs from Eli Lilly and Co and Novo Nordisk known as semaglutide and tirzepatide were proven to help obese patients lose weight.

Both of those drugs which need to be injected every two weeks are designed to activate GLP-1 a hormone that triggers the feeling of fullness in the body after eating.

Amgen's AMG133 also targets GLP-1 but has a dual mechanism which aims at the same time to block activity of a gene known as GIP.

The drug was developed from work at Amgen to identify genetic signals associated with lower fat mass and body weight and also healthy metabolic profiles explained Saptarsi Haldar head of cardiovascular metabolic discovery at Amgen.

""Genetics clearly showed in multiple large populations that decreased activity genetically of the GIP receptor gene was associated with lower BMI (body mass index)"" he said.

The California-based biotech said it plans to launch a larger mid-stage study of AMG133 early next year which will enroll a broader range of patients including those with additional health conditions such as diabetes.

JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott earlier this month said that if all goes well a Phase III study of AMG133 could begin in 2024 with a launch expected in 2026 or 2027 if approved.

In the wake of a false tweet about free insulin sending Twitter into a frenzy Rick defended his company but conceded that there is more work to do to bring down the cost of this life-saving drug for more people.

Meanwhile in Washington D.C. Mitch McConnell is facing some backlash of his own.

This caused many to question whether or not Mitch was fit to represent all Americans when he so blatantly opposed this bill intended break down discriminatory barriers preventing same-sex couples from getting married nationwide back in 2015 via Obergefell vs Hodges landmark ruling.

Faculty members say many companies are either staying off the campus or making very few offers. Older IITs like Bombay Kanpur Madras Guwahati and Roorkee said while pay packages being offered are more or less the same the number of overall recruitments in particular by the Information Technology (IT) sector companies has been slightly low. The first phase started on December 1 and will go on till December 15.

“On the first day of placements we had 46 companies interviewing candidates either online or in-person. Of the 250 job offers on Day 1 more than 175 were accepted. Besides 300 pre-placement offers (PPO) were received of which 194 were accepted. While salary packages have remained largely unchanged tech giants have either been very selective or have not visited the campus this year” said an IIT-Bombay spokesperson.

Some companies that have recruited are Accenture Solutions Airbus India Microsoft India Morgan Stanley McKinsey Procter & Gamble Qualcomm Shell India Texas Instruments and Tata Steel among others the spokesperson added.

“Placements are going on well but not as good as past few years. Some of the IT companies cancelled at the last moment while there were some that registered and took the initial test but backed out last minute or hired very few. International offers were even lesser. It is mostly the start-ups that made good offers” a professor at IIT-Kanpur said who did not wish to be named.

Final year students at IIT-Roorkee received 500 offers (some of the results are still awaited) by a total of 63 companies in two days of placements till 2pm on Friday of which six were international offers.

“Overall the placements have been fine but of course there is an impact of the global economic situation in the IT sector. The market is volatile. The overall recruitment numbers have reduced than past few years even as there has been diversification of profiles. Many of the big tech companies have not turned up or remained too selective in their approach. They are just being cautious given the scenario but students are ready to face the challenges” said Kaushik Pal professor in-Charge (placements) IIT-Roorkee.

The highest offer bagged was of Rs 1.3 crore made by a domestic company while about Rs 1 crore offer was made by international companies said Pal.

Despite the slight dip in international offers IIT-Madras and IIT-Guwahati saw a jump in the number of offers made by domestic companies with the latter bagging the highest international offer of Rs 2.04 crore on day one of the placements by two students while highest domestic offers was of Rs 1.1 crore.

At Guwahati the big recruiters of this year’s first two sessions include Microsoft Google Uber Qualcomm Enphase Energy Oracle Nutanix Thoughtspot MTS-2 Texas Instruments American Express and JP Morgan.

“Initially the big giants for instance Microsoft said they would not participate in the placement sessions as many of these had already given PPOs but it was only last week that they registered. International offers were slightly fewer than last year yet the pay package offered was highest so far this season. Most of the offers this time were national” said Abhishek Kumar head centre for career placements at IIT-Guwahati.

Santosh Gudlavalleti a final-year electrical engineering student at IIT-Madras who coordinates non-core placements at the institute said there were recession fears among companies that made them slightly hesitant of hiring but the overall placement scenario was decent. The international offers went up to around Rs 1.8 crore while the highest domestic offer made is of Rs 1.6 crore.

“There were a few companies for instance Zomato which gave PPOs but didn’t turn up for the placement sessions. Still a number of other companies including those based in Europe US and Japan came in such as Maverick Da Vinci Microsoft and Google among others” he said.

Most institutes said Amazon which saw massive layoffs this year did not come for placements this season. The second-generation IITs whose placements cycle is not in sync with the older IITs maintain that they will be able to share data only after a week or so of the placements.

“We can share precise numbers only around December 12-13. But with the current job offers we have seen an increase in all the parameters namely number of offers pay packages PPOs etc. Due to recession we have observed less participation from the start-ups particularly” said prof Tushar Jain faculty advisor career and placement cell IIT-Mandi.

Sure we get the things like the Ford Transit but that's designed more for commercial applications. The KIA Carnival made minivans stylish again but that's a bit too big. The American market lacks so many of the cool small fun vans Europe gets like the new adorably named Mercedes EQT.

The Mercedes EQT is an electric version of the internal combustion-powered T-Class van. It features the same basic exterior design as the piston-powered T-Class and is built on the same chassis but it has a different grille. The EQT's grille is more of a big black panel with only a few horizontal slices in it as it doesn't need as much cooling as the normal T-Class.

It looks mostly the same inside too with a pretty typical modern Mercedes interior but that's no bad thing. As with most Mercedes products the interior is handsome and luxurious even if it's a bit predictable. But we're talking about small vans. A flashy interior isn't much of a priority. Instead practicality and comfort come first.

Inside the new EQT you'll find the same interior space as the normal car. The EQT's battery pack is built into the floor but it doesn't impede on passenger space thanks to clever packaging. That means it also has the same rear load sill height of 561 millimeters which makes loading in heavy objects just as easy.

Mercedes didn't provide a range number for the EQT but it has a smallish battery at just 45 kWh. At launch it only gets one powertrain option a single electric motor with 122 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque. Using the onboard charger the EQT can charge at up to 22 kW on an AC current from either a home outlet or Level 2 charger. Its DC fast-charging speed is 80 kWh and can charge the car from 10-80 percent in 38 minutes.

Alongside the EQT Mercedes also unveiled the Concept EQT Marco Polo a camper version of the electric van. It comes with a scissor-style popup roof which is slanted upward toward the rear so there's enough room for adults to stand inside. A bed can also be unfolded inside the cabin which covers the entire rear of the van. The popup roof can be opened or even windowed with a zipper on the rear. There's a drawer system a cooking station a small refrigerator and even a little sink. It's actually pretty amazing to see how Mercedes was able to cram so much stuff into such a small van.

The non-camper Mercedes EQT starts at 49000 euros ($61633 direct exchange rate) which is pretty expensive for such a small electric van with a small battery. However for anyone that doesn't need their family van to drive very far and they'd like a premium electric experience the Mercedes EQT offers a pretty compelling overall package. Now all Mercedes needs to do is sell it 'Stateside.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FyY29uZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjAyMjEyMDMtZXF0Y2FtcGVyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mercedes-Benz Vans shows electric small van camper Concept EQT Marco Polo,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.greencarcongress.com/2022/12/20221203-eqtcamper.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FyY29uZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjAyMjEyMDMtZXF0Y2FtcGVyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoZS1mZWF0dXJlcy10aGF0LW1ha2UtdGhlLW5ldy1tZXJjZWRlcy1iZW56LWVxdC1tYXJjby1wb2xvLW1vZHVsZS1hLXZlcnNhdGlsZS1jYW1waW5nLXZhbi0yMDU0OTkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Features That Make the New Mercedes-Benz EQT Marco Polo Module a Versatile Camper Van,"MPV

kWh

First things first let’s address the elephant in the room. Mercedes-Benz used the phrase “fully electric short trips” because the series-production EQT leaves much to be desired in terms of driving range. In its lightest form this all-electricoffers 282 kilometers (175 miles) of range if you drive in accordance with the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure. On the upside rapid charging of the 46-battery with a usable capacity of 45 kWh takes just 38 minutes from 10 to 80 percent.To be offered through Mercedes-Benz branches and dealers in the near future the Marco Polo Module transforms the EQT into four-wheeled accommodation thanks to a bed unit with a 2- by 1.15-meter sleeping surface. That’s 6.5 by 3.7 feet which is pretty swell given the compact footprint of the vehicle. The 10-cm (3.9-in) thick mattress is joined by a point-elastic disc spring system and when needed the bed frame can be pulled out forward. Of course said mattress can be folded out. Both the bed frame and mattress can be stored in the loading compartment while on the move thus freeing up the rear seats for either passengers or luggage.Mercedes-Benz also throws in blackout elements for the window panes as well as a ventilation grille with insect protection. Standard equipment further includes two window pockets located between the C and D pillars. In terms of optional extras the Marco Polo Module wouldn’t be complete without the kitchen unit. Based on a drawer system it flaunts a 12-liter (3.2-gallon) water tank a 15-liter (4.2-gallon) compressor refrigerator box a sink plus a flexible removable gas cartridge cooker. The remaining drawers provide adequate space for crockery cutlery and food supplies.Once again optional the optional kitchen unit can be joined by two campaign chairs and a table if you’re prepared to pony up a few more euros. Mercedes-Benz hasn’t mentioned any pricing information for the Marco Polo Module for the time being but we do know the most basic of EQT trim levels will start at approximately 49000 euros (51550 dollars).Said table comes with two different feet which means that it can be used outdoors or attached to the center console of the EQT. Fixed to the lashing eyelets in the cargo compartment the Marco Polo Module can be easily removed or reinstalled. Augmented with the brand’s three-pointed star and Mercedes-Benz lettering the module will be available in anthracite only.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9tZXJjZWRlcy1wcmVzZW50cy1lbGVjdHJpYy1taWNyby1jYW1wZXItdmFuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mercedes presents electric micro camper van,"Mercedes-Benz Vans has presented the Concept EQT Marco Polo1 a study of an all-electric micro-camper. At the same time the company also previews the EQT series design set apart from the eCitan.

There are no surprises regarding the drive inside the camper concept. The electric motor has a peak output of 90 kW and offers a maximum torque of 245 Nm. The battery has a usable energy content of 45 kWh and is crash-protected in the underbody in front of the rear axle. The AC onboard charger allows charging with up to 22 kW; at a DC station charging is possible with 80 kW at peak from ten to 80 per cent it takes 38 minutes according to Mercedes.

There is a simple reason these data seem familiar: They match those of the Mercedes eCitan the commercial vehicle version of the high-roof station wagon which is based on the Renault Kangoo. The Nissan Townstar also uses the sale platform and drive. So even if the Camper-EQT is still a study changes ahead of production are unlikely. Mercedes already writes in the announcement that “at market launch” this drive would be available. But that at least leaves the possibility of other e-drives after the market launch.

The EQT is 4498 millimetres long 1859 millimetres wide and 1819 millimetres high. A long-wheelbase version will follow in 2023. Visually it stands out from the eCitan for example thanks to the “black panel” grille at the front where the eCitan resembles the combustion engine model. The black design element is intended to make the EQT “instantly recognizable” as a member of the Mercedes EQ family. However Mercedes has dispensed with the continuous LED light strip between the headlights. At least there are redesigned LED daytime running lights within the headlights in distinction to the eCitan. However the current Marco Polo study has little in common with the EQT study shown in 2021 which was still very independent compared with the Renault.

N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A

The high-roof estate – Mercedes prefers to call it a Small Van – should be available to order “in the near future”. Prices start at around €49000 for the EQT with a 90 kW electric motor and standard length. It is unknown what the extended version or the Marco Polo offshoot will cost.

The Concept EQT Marco Polo1 is based on the long-wheelbase EQT variant. The equipment of the Concept EQT Marco Polo1 includes among other things a pop-up roof with a roof bed (1.97×0.97 metres of lying space). In the rear is another folding sleeping area measuring 2 metres by 1.15 metres.

In addition there is an element in the second row of seats behind the driver’s seat with a recessed flushing facility and a 16-litre compressor cooler also recessed. Directly next to it is one of two bench seats. Another seat is on the left side of the vehicle in the interior (looking towards the rear cockpit). The drawer system installed here offers sufficient storage space for camping accessories. There is also an induction hob and a drawer that can be pulled out of the vehicle interior with a flexibly removable gas cartridge cooker so that there are two options for cooking.

Those who do not want to convert their EQT into a camper permanently will also get a so-called Marco Polo Module which will be offered for the standard wheelbase. The module which can be installed and removed provides a bed and a kitchen unit optionally. The bed is also 2×1.15 metres but the kitchen unit has a slightly different layout than the permanently converted Marco Polo. Prices for the module are not yet known but it should also be available for order directly from Mercedes-Benz branches and dealers “in the near future”.

This spring there was more work than many companies could handle but a shortage of labor and materials. Within months interest rates doubled and home building plunged.

Ryan is president and owner of Genz-Ryan a market-leading HVAC company founded more than 70 years ago by his father. For years the company's bread and butter was installing furnaces and air conditioners in new houses.

Not anymore. He recently shuttered the new-construction division of Genz-Ryan wiping out the work of 40 people. The company will focus on service and installations.

""It's been like trying to turn the Titanic"" he said referring to the well-known ship that sank after hitting an iceberg. ""Only about one-third of what you can see is above water. It's what you can't see that worries me.""

After a pandemic-fueled building boom that left builders and their subcontractors overwhelmed and exhausted a sudden contraction is reshaping the industry.

""We are seeing prudence exercised by many segments of the homebuilding industry in response to the slowing pace over the past several months"" said James Vagle CEO of Housing First Minnesota.

The situation is especially perplexing for companies that were in business during the 2008 housing crash which sent skilled workers fleeing to other industries. While they're well aware that the region is still in need of tens of thousands of new houses and apartments they also realize that demand can quickly ebb and flow.

""Builders and trade partners are being cautious as many have gone through cycle slowdowns in construction before"" Vagle said. ""The challenge is that the demand for homes did not vanish it's just sitting on the sidelines. Builders know eventually they are going to have to ramp back up again in order to supply our region with much needed housing.""

To be sure no one anticipates the kind of housing crash that triggered the Great Recession in 2008. That downturn was caused by risk lending and an oversupply of new houses which is not the case today.

That recession happened when Ryan wasn't yet in charge and about 90% of the company's customers were home builders. Though they lost about two-thirds of their business the company was less diversified than it was today so exiting the new-build business wasn't an option.

""Our business mix wouldn't have allowed us to make that decision"" Ryan said. He added ""And I was a lot younger and had the energy to be able to handle a downturn.""

Today Ryan says that because so many people are spending so much more time in their homes including remote work they're using their furnace and air conditioning a lot more. That equipment and their components need more service and replacement.

And he said because people are staying put longer focusing on servicing existing clients makes a lot more sense than it did during the last recession.

Because fewer people are moving there have been few sellers and even fewer buyers but prices keep rising. Last week the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index showed that home prices in the Twin Cities during September were more than 6% higher than last year at the same time. That gain was smaller than earlier this year but in line with historical averages.

For builders it was a record-breaking spring and many are still building houses that were purchased earlier this year. More recently building permits have tumbled. During November builders pulled half as many permits as they did the year before according to new data released last week by Housing First Minnesota.

That shift has left many builders subcontractors and their suppliers only cautiously optimistic about 2023.

It's a paradox that has the nation's largest builders and suppliers looking for ways to control costs. Executives at Builders FirstSource the Dallas-based leading supplier of building products recently told investors they're executing what they call a ""downturn playbook"" which includes freezing or reducing jobs.

Several publicly traded home builders including Pulte Homes which has a major presence in the Twin Cities are canceling options on land purchases and scaling back development plans.

Michael Ramme vice president of land acquisition for Centra a Coon Rapids-based developer said that as national builders ""pump the brakes"" there are opportunities for companies that aren't beholden to shareholders to acquire land more affordably than last summer. He said it's getting easier to hire subcontractors.

""There are subs who now need the work; two years ago they wouldn't even look at you"" Ramme said. ""The tables have turned.""

At Genz-Ryan that change in fortune forced a reckoning. Ryan said he reached the decision to close the construction division even though it was getting easier to hire workers and obtain supplies.

The final straw Ryan said was the realization that so many homeowners are locked into the lowest mortgage rates in a generation. That means they're unlikely to move because if they buy again they would contend with sharply higher rates. Those frozen homeowners could be a drag on homebuilding for the next several years.

""It was really about rising interest rates; that changed everything"" Ryan said. ""But I felt like this was the right time for us to make the decision.""

Some of those 40 employees that lost their jobs stayed with the company and were reassigned in its service division Ryan said. Others were able to quickly find other jobs.

As much as Ryan was concerned about his ability to keep crews busy during the housing downturn he saw the decision as an opportunity to aggressively grow the service and replacement business.

He wants the company known for its advertising with the catchphrase ""I love those guys"" to remain a local standout at a time when private-equity firms are buying heating and cooling firms and consolidating them under national brands.

Ryan said that he's in the process of turning the former new-construction showroom and selection center into the Jack Ryan Academy which is named after his father. He'll use that space to train workers.

Making the decision to eliminate the new-construction division of his company was like a ""gut punch"" he said. But he added it's the right decision given the ongoing challenges facing the industry.

""The study of economics is the science of trying to satisfy unlimited wants with limited resources"" Ryan said. ""This really came down to a handful of decisions.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9tb25leS93aGF0LW5lZ2F0aXZlLWVxdWl0eS1tYW55LWhvbWVvd25lcnMtMjg2MzY4OTHSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvbW9uZXkvd2hhdC1uZWdhdGl2ZS1lcXVpdHktbWFueS1ob21lb3duZXJzLTI4NjM2ODkxLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is negative equity - and why are so many homeowners now at risk?,"House prices are starting to fall which means many homes will be worth less than the mortgage taken out on them which is a serious problem for many new homeowners

What is negative equity - and why are so many homeowners now at risk?

Negative equity is a real risk again after years out of the spotlight - and it means bad news for people buying houses.

In short negative equity is when your property is worth less than the mortgage you took out on it.

That is a problem for two reasons.

One if you try to sell a property in negative equity you still owe your mortgage lender the difference.

Two if you own a home in negative equity and come to the end of your mortgage you may struggle to get a new homeloan and end up paying even more.

That is because you may get stuck with your current lender which normally means falling off your mortgage rate and onto a more expensive higher standard variable rate (SVR).

In other words you can't sell you can't move and you are stuck paying higher monthly mortgage rates until you get out of negative equity again.

Lewis Shaw founder of broker Riverside Mortgages said: “Categorically you can't remortgage if you're in negative equity.""

The risk is greatest for people with big mortgages and little equity in their homes. Most of this group will be recent first-time buyers who may have a mortgage of 95% of the cost of their house.

That leaves very little buffer if house prices fall.

However these problems have faded from many people's minds because the last negative equity crisis was in the late 2000 and the one before that was in the early 1990s.

Around 345000 homes were repossessed during 1990 and 1995 as a result.

How likely is widespread negative equity?

Negative equity may become a reality again next year experts say - because house prices are starting to fall.

House prices in the UK fell at their biggest rate in more than two years in November according to Nationwide this week.

The average house price fell by 1.4% month on month in November – the biggest drop since June 2020.

It follows a 0.9% monthly fall in October.

Tom Bill head of UK residential research at estate agent Knight Frank said: ""We expect house prices to fall by 10% over the next two years and the reality of higher rates will bite more after Christmas.""

Around 190000 homes will fall into negative equity if houses prices fall by 8% according to the Resolution Foundation.

If property values drop by 18% 600000 homes will be affected.

What to do if you are in negative equity

Your first step should be to talk to your mortgage lender and see what options they offer you.

You may be able to do a 'product transfer' - i.e. swap to another mortgage with the same lender - and not pay high SVR rates.

Lenders may be able to swap you onto an interest-only mortgage for a while for example which would save you money.

Another option is a negative equity mortgage - but these are rare.

Otherwise you'll have to try to wait the problem out.

Shaw said: ""Suppose a homeowner finds themselves in negative equity where the value of the outstanding loan is equal to or more than the value of their home. In that case some lenders may still have product transfer rates available but in other cases it will mean they'll have to move onto the standard variable rate and sit there until the situation improves.""

Chris Schutrups founder at broker The Mortgage Hut added: ""Should a borrower find themselves in the position where prices have fallen and they do not have the option to remortgage away they will generally but not always have the ability to do a product transfer with their existing lender that will normally not require further underwriting.""

Put simply if you want to get out of negative equity you need to get to the stage where your property is worth more than the outstanding mortgage.

As such you have a couple of options.

The first is to reduce the size of the mortgage.

If you're on a repayment mortgage you will eventually clear that loan in full and own the property outright if you can keep up the monthly repayments.

If you're on an interest-only mortgage things are trickier - as the only way to get out of negative equity is for house prices to rise again. Generally this will happen over time but it's not guaranteed and as long as you meet payments your debt won't be called in.

Overpaying your mortgage can get you out of negative equity quicker if you can afford to.

Most mortgages allow you to overpay by up to 10% a year or £500 a month without incurring any additional charges but check with your lender first.

The other route is to look at ways to increase the value of your home.

This is obviously risky.

There is no guarantee that spending money on something like an extension or a new kitchen will bump up the value of your home enough to get you out of negative equity. But if you can afford to it may make a difference.",,,

Rating: About this rating False

In early December 2022 amid an ongoing public furor over lurid ad campaigns for the fashion house Balenciaga that featured child exploitation and BDSM themes social media users shared what appeared to be a Balenciaga ad promoting a men's jacket made of human skin.

In reality however the photograph used in the ""ad"" was then roughly five years old had nothing to do with Balenciaga or any Balenciaga product and had been deceptively edited to bear the company's logo.

(Twitter screenshot)

(Twitter screenshot)

The picture which did not originally contain a Balenciaga logo was taken from an Etsy page active in January 2017 that offered faux human-skin garments created by Australian special effects artist Kayla Arena. Here are a few of the products that were advertised on the page at the time:

(Kayla Arena's Etsy Page January 2017)

Arena uses latex and silicone to simulate human skin in her creations which more recently have included fake-but-real-looking corpses and body parts she constructed for the Guillermo Del Toro horror anthology TV series ""Cabinet of Curiosities.""

We emphasize again that none of these creations were made using real human flesh and none of them are connected in any way with Balenciaga.

A similar deceptive social media campaign was built around a falsely labeled picture purporting to show Balenciaga stylist Lotta Volkova covered in blood and modeling a ""satanic"" outfit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxkc2xpdmluZy5jb20vd29uZGVyLWluLXdhdGVyY29sb3Ivcy8xMTEwNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Lola Dutch' artist on faith imagination and bringing wonder to children,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxkc2xpdmluZy5jb20vd29uZGVyLWluLXdhdGVyY29sb3Ivcy8xMTEwNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C491C3FC70>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Midnights On Vinyl

There’s no better place to start this gift guide than the music itself. Vinyl records are a great way to switch up your music listening experience and Swift’s vinyls come in a variety of colors that match the vibes of the albums. For example Midnights comes in the shades Lavender Jade Blood Moon and Mahogany. As an added bonus if you buy all four colors you can position the vinyl sleeves to look like a clock.

Buy Midnights (and Taylor’s entire discography) on vinyl at Target.

“F*ck the Patriarchy” Keychain

If your Swiftie is a fan of Red (Taylor’s Version) they’re likely a fan of “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)”. This keychain inspired by the lyrics of the song is sure to make any Taylor Swift stan happy especially if they agree with the sentiment.

Something Bejeweled

If your Swiftie is more of a Midnights person you might consider getting them something bejeweled in honor of the song from Taylor’s newest album. The shimmery music video has already inspired a lot of gem-encrusted fan looks like the ones linked below.

This dress inspired by Taylor’s look from the 2018 AMAs definitely fits the “Bejeweled” vibe but if you’re looking for a more subtle sparkly look you can opt for one of these custom rhinestone headbands.

Red Scarf

This one’s a no-brainer—any Swiftie will immediately recognize this reference to “All Too Well.”

This might not be the exact scarf Taylor (allegedly) left at her ex's sister's house but we think it’s still a cute nod to the song.

Mirrorballs

These mirrorball planters are ideal for any Swiftie who’s also a plant parent. A subtle reference to the Folklore song “Mirrorball” these planters will cast glimmers of light across the entire room AND make their plants look super snazzy.

If plants aren't their thing you could also go with this set of eight disco balls in different sizes.

Something With The Number 13

Taylor Swift’s lucky number is 13 so any Swiftie could wear a 13 as a nod to Ms. Swift.

“Karma Is A Cat” Ugly Christmas Sweater

If your Swiftie loves cats as much as Taylor herself does this ugly Christmas sweater with lyrics from the Midnights song “Karma” is a winner. The kitty on this sweatshirt even kind of looks like Taylor’s own cat Captain Olivia Benson.

I definitely see the resemblance.

Cat Airpods Case

Taylor Swift is a self-proclaimed cat lady as are many of her fans. This airpods case looks just like a cute kitty paw with perfect pink beans plus it will keep your headphones safe. Trust me Swifties don't have any money to spend on a new pair of airpods after making it through the Eras presale.

If you're going to sing the lyrics ""Karma is a cat purring in my lap cuz it loves me"" you should at LEAST have a cat themed accessory nearby.

Buy the Silicone Cat Airpods Case on Amazon.

But as corporations face the most daunting economic environment since the 2008 financial crisis those massive checks they're writing to AWS for their tech infrastructure are getting greater scrutiny.

Peter Kern CEO of online travel company Expedia Group  sees the cloud as an area where his company can reduce its fixed costs. In recent years Expedia has moved considerable parts of its operations to AWS from on-premises data centers.

""We haven't fully optimized the cloud"" Kern said during the company's earnings call last month. ""We've moved a lot of technology into the cloud but we have a lot of work to do.""

U.S. stocks are poised to close out their worst year since 2008. Central bankers have continued to lift interest rates to address rising prices prompting skittishness about economic deterioration by consumers and businesses. Executives are in cash-preservation mode to appease Wall Street and make sure they're in position to weather a potential recession.

The National Football League which uses AWS to produce statistics and schedules is making conservative plans around costs said Jennifer Langton the NFL's senior vice president of health and innovation.

""We are not recession proof"" Langton told CNBC during an interview at AWS' annual Reinvent customer conference in Las Vegas this week. The league is negotiating with AWS on the terms of a renewed multi-year agreement and there are some areas her organization wants to prioritize she said.

Amazon knows customers are facing challenges. In some cases Amazon cloud employees reach out to clients to see how it can help optimize spending said David Brown AWS' vice president responsible for the core EC2 computing service. At other times customers contact AWS he said.

AWS is coming off its slowest period of expansion since at least 2014 the year Amazon started reporting on the group's finances. It also missed analysts' estimates. Still the division recorded growth of 27.5% outpacing Amazon's overall growth of 15%. And it generated $5.4 billion in operating income accounting for more than 100% of profit for its parent company.

With such a hefty cash balance AWS can afford to accommodate customers in the short term if it means more business in the future. The company did the same thing during the pandemic in 2020 when Amazon sent some users an email with an offer of financial support.

AWS isn't the sole big cloud provider that's dealing with customers' budget constraints. In the third quarter Microsoft's Azure consumption growth moderated as the company helped clients optimize existing workloads finance chief Amy Hood said in October. Amazon leads the market in cloud computing with an estimated 39% share.

""If you're looking to tighten your belt the cloud is the place to do it"" AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said during his keynote presentation in front of over 50000 people on Tuesday. Selipsky said that moving IT jobs to the cloud could help budget-strapped organizations save money citing customers Agco and Carrier Global .

Not everyone agrees. Last year investors Sarah Wang and Martìn Casado of venture firm Andreessen Horowitz published an analysis showing that a company could trim its computing costs by half or more by bringing workloads from the cloud back to on-premises data centers.

Amazon is trying to give customers options to reduce costs. It offers Graviton computing instances based on energy-efficient Arm-based chips a less expensive alternative to instances using standard AMD and Intel processors.

""Customers of every size have adopted Graviton and they're achieving up to 40% better price performance simply by shifting their workloads to Graviton instances"" Selipsky said. He said AT&T 's DirecTV unit was able to eliminate 20% of computing costs by adopting current-generation Graviton chips.

Selipsky told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview that AWS teams are working with customers that are trying to become more efficient.

""We do see some customers who are doing some belt-tightening now"" Selipsky said. One example is data analytics software maker Palantir  which said last month its operating profit in the third quarter was higher than expected primarily because of cloud and deployment efficiencies.

Other companies are in on the trend. NetApp and VMware have acquired startups to help businesses streamline their cloud spending. On the Reinvent exhibition floor several companies were promoting their cost-trimming capabilities.

Zesty which announced a $75 million funding round in September added Sainsbury and Silicon Laboratories to its customer list in the current quarter. The company's technology can automatically adjust the amount of storage space a company is using to avoid waste.

CEO Maxim Melamedov said Zesty picked up a bunch of new leads at its Reivent booth where the startup was handing out candy socks and stuffed animals and giving visitors the chance to win AirPods.

""Some of my guys lost their voices"" Melamedov said. ""We are 15 people constantly on our feet. We're constantly talking.""

More Americans take on multiple jobs to make ends meet,"Year-end holidays are usually joyous filled with gift-giving and plenty to eat and drink. But with inflation surging this year some of that cheer has been replaced with worry about how to afford those treats along with everyday necessities.

Some Americans are coping by cutting back on things they don’t need or finding cheaper options but an increasing number of Americans are taking on side hustles.

In November the economy added 263000 jobs the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday topping economists’ average forecast of 200000 according to Dow Jones. Buried in the details though is a 165000 jump in people holding multiple jobs. That’s the largest rise since June and above the 60000 monthly average increase in the last six months noted Comerica Bank chief economist Bill Adams.

This trend was also noted in the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book which chronicles economic conditions in different regions across the country.

“Nonprofit service providers noted an uptick in the number of clients relying on side gigs to make ends meet or as pathways to financial self-sufficiency” the Atlanta Fed said in its portion of the report last week.

Who’s taking extra work?

Most adults (68%) either already have or plan to pick up a side gig like delivering food with DoorDash or renting out extra space in their homes according to a Neighbor.com survey of 1000 people.

Additionally 44% of Americans work or plan to work a seasonal job like shipping packages for Amazon or stocking and unloading for Walmart. And 51% either work or plan to work overtime at their current 9-5 job the survey said.

Of those taking on extra jobs 18 to 40-year-olds remain the largest group of side hustlers said Kathy Kristof editor at SideHusl which researches opportunities to make extra money. “But over the last six months we’ve seen an increasing number of seniors looking to help make ends meet” she said.

Why are people taking side hustles?

The highest inflation in a generation has ravaged household budgets with many Americans increasingly dipping into savings and racking up credit card debt to pay for everyday items. The personal savings rate dropped in October to 2.3% the lowest in 17 years the Commerce Department said on Thursday.

Meanwhile third-quarter household debt climbed at the fastest annual pace since 2008 with credit card balances rising by 15% the most in 20 years Fed data showed. The surge came even as credit card interest rates rose to the highest level since the mid-1980s according to Bankrate data.

More than 4 out of 5 Americans who have or plan to take on a side gig seasonal job or extra hours at work say inflation played a role in their decision Neighbor.com said.

“There’s always a holiday uptick from October until February or March by people who do these jobs to pay for holiday gifts parties and clothing” Kristof said. “This year it’s very hard to differentiate the holiday uptick from the inflation uptick but all of it combines for a significant rise in people looking for side hustles.”

For seniors “the stock market dropped as inflation soared so some people know that they're in no position to handle that increase in costs and decrease in savings” she said. ""And other people are just worried they won’t be able to keep up with inflation given the state of savings.”

How are people making extra money?

Gig workers still mainly gravitate toward ride-hailing services driving delivering groceries and renting out living and storage space which usually don’t require a long resume or experience Neighbors.com said.

But the gig economy has expanded since the early days. “The great news is that experience is highly valued in today’s side hustle world” Kristof said. “There’s burgeoning growth in professional side hustles that offer opportunities in consulting law accounting HR (human resources) marketing and even engineering and project management. It’s highly paid and highly valued remote work.”

Professional side work can pay upwards of $50 an hour she said.

The former employee posted a video on TikTok (@nabeel_co) sharing how Apple allegedly “scams” its customers. In the video he says it’s “not your fault” if your iPhone is running out of space.

The TikToker claims there is a “longstanding” bug in iOS that prevents cache files and temp files from being cleared up as they should. Eventually those files build up more and more until they use up all the extra space on an iPhone.

“Then what do people do? They go out and they buy a new phone” the TikToker says in the video. “They don’t realize that if they just backed up to iTunes or iCloud wiped their phone then restored it from their backup that they could get all their data back and all of a sudden magically have 20% more free space.”

The TikToker alleges that since the bug sells so many iPhones Apple won’t fix the problem — even though they know it exists.

The video sparked a variety of reactions among viewers. Some said they have tried to back up their phone and then restore it but the hack didn’t work as well as people say.

“Every single time I’ve tried to restore from an iTunes backup I lose an insane amount of my important data. Too much business info. Can’t risk it” one viewer commented.

Some questioned who actually buys a new phone because their old phone’s storage is full.

“I mean… if people buy new phones because full storage they deserve to be scammed. Phones aren’t a new thing neither is storage” one viewer wrote.

“Bro wild eyed and dropping knowledge here. But who buys a new phone when their memory fills up?” another viewer asked.

Others shared their hacks for clearing up storage space on their iPhones.

“I delete all my apps  shut down & then reinstall and I get my space back An ex apple employee told me that” one user said.

Another user commented “alternatively just download a movie and it clears temp files. delete movie and the ‘other data’ drops to like 8gb.”

As for Android users they were quick to swoop in to bash Apple and praise Android.

“Alternatively clear cache in one click on an Android” one viewer said.

“Apple is a cult” a second wrote.

From small dwellings designed for weekenders to larger houses that offer all the amenities a small family needs there’s a tiny for every individual with a particular mobile lifestyle that wants to downsize his life. The Kauri sits on the bigger side including three bedrooms a full kitchen and a bathroom with a full-size shower.

This charming dwelling is called Kauri  and it was designed and built by the skilled team from Tiny House Builders a New Zealand-based company that has been around since 2017. The team started their tiny journey with a small home meant to be a rental in Auckland. However that tiny was so popular that it was featured on the Tauranga Home Show and never made it to its destination.Now several years later the Tiny House Builders continue to create incredible homes that match the needs and preferences of their owners. Kauri was designed to function as a permanent residence since it can actually accommodate a growing family. Russel and Sarah contacted the team from Tiny House Builders since they wanted something that would offer mobility but also a space that would not feel overwhelmingly cramped.The Kauri was a great option since it doesn’t feel small at all. This house measures only 8 meters (26 ft) in length and it’s 3 meters wide (10 ft wide). But it’s surprisingly large managing to fit inside a fully-equipped kitchen a bathroom with a full-size shower and not one not two but three bedrooms! Kauri offers Russel Sarah and their two kids all the space they need. This family also asked the builder to add a deck to Kauri so they could extend their living space.They also added a roof and created a lovely outdoor seating area they can use whenever they want. The tiny house comes with a French glass door positioned at the front which blurs the lines between the interior and the exterior of the home. Right in front of the entrance is an L-shaped kitchen equipped with all the necessary appliances. It has everything a regular-sized dwelling has! That includes an oven a microwave a two-burner propane cooktop and a range hood. But that’s not all. It has a full-size fridge a sink a small dishwasher and even a washing machine.The kitchen also has a generous countertop offering dwellers all the space they need to prep their meals. Of course it has numerous overhead cabinets and pull-out drawers that provide ample amounts of storage. Across the kitchen is the dining area/ living room. The model can include a table or people can opt for a sofa. Russel and Sarah actually added both. Russel and his friend designed a wooden bench that turns into a table for four!From the dining area/living room owners will have to walk down the hallway to get to the bathroom which features a full-sized corner shower a beautiful vanity a composting toilet and some shelves for storage. In front of the bathroom you’ll spot another door that provides access to the rear of the tiny home.That’s where the master bedroom is located. The main floor bedroom is a great addition to any tiny house especially for those who don’t want to climb the stairs all the time. This area offers plenty of headroom and it feels super spacious. It has tons of storage provided by the massive wardrobe. There’s also a queen-size bed that lifts up to offer even more storage.The other two bedrooms are located upstairs. Once you climb up the stairs you’ll find one on the right and one on the left. This separation allows whoever sleeps upstairs to enjoy their own space. Speaking of that the bedrooms have enough room for twin beds. Russel and Sarah even added some chairs that turn into beds so whenever their kids have a friend over they have another extra sleeping space.Kauri was featured on the Living Big In A Tiny House YouTube channel. You can watch the clip down below to see how Russel and Sarah customized the tiny house to match their preferences."

Guyanese government officials and executives from New York-based Hess signed off on the agreement late Friday under the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation program (REDD).



This is the second such major deal the country has negotiated in the past decade. Back in 2009 Norway had signed off on a deal to provide $250 million in funding to help ensure the country’s 18 million hectares of forest will remain intact.



Government says it will pursue efforts to secure additional partners in the carbon credit market as the country works to ensure minimal harvesting of its forest resources in a country the size of Britain or the U.S. state of Idaho with less than 1 million inhabitants.



“Guyana is one of the most heavily forested countries in the world. We admire the efforts that Guyana has undertaken for years to protect the country’s forest and the government’s constant efforts to combat climate change and provide a strong model for other countries other businesses and other governments” said John Hess Chief Executive of Hess Corporation at the signing ceremony.



Meanwhile Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo said about 30% of the $750 million will be set aside for developments in Indigenous Amerindian communities. There are nine such tribes in Guyana accounting for about 10% of the population.



""I want to thank Hess Corporation for this agreement. It is clearly transformative and moves us closer to the objectives that we were working on” Jagdeo said.

“ExxonMobil is looking at lots of different ways to manage climate change and this is always going to be one of the considerations” ExxonMobil Guyana Country Manager Alistair Routledge told reporters on Friday following the signing of the carbon credits agreement between Guyana and Hess.

Hess on Friday inked an agreement for the purchase of US$750 million of this country’s carbon credits over 10 years.

Routledge was asked if a similar agreement was being explored by his company.

The US oil major had in January of this year announced its ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions for operated assets by 2050 backed by a comprehensive approach to develop detailed emission-reduction roadmaps for major facilities and assets.

While it had flared here for more than a year the company had played up its energy transition plans boasting that it created its Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialise its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio with its Chairman Darren Woods telling a company earnings call in February that it was a main focus.

He had said that the company was on the path and advancing plans for more than 20 new carbon capture and storage opportunities around the world to enable large-scale emission reductions but no mention or assurance had been then given about curtailing flaring here.

The company stated that it aims to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions for operated assets by 2050 with plans to achieve net zero in the West Texas shale Permian Basin by 2030.

“We’re also accelerating our work to reduce emissions and drive innovations focused on the hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry and commercial transportation. An important part of this activity is our ambition to achieve net-zero emissions from our operations by 2050. Also important is the good progress we’ve made building our low carbon solutions business which is rapidly expanding utilizing existing policy. As you’re all aware we’re also pursuing very large scale opportunities that will give us first-mover advantage as we advocate for the new policy necessary to support these step-out projects” Woods outlined.

The company said that it expects to achieve emission-reduction plans four years ahead of schedule.

“Our results demonstrate the benefits of the actions we’ve taken. We’re continuing to manage and evolve the company to further strengthen our competitive advantages growing value through the transition regardless of its pace” Woods declared.

Flaring and the emission effects on the environment have been an issue that environmentalists and citizens in Guyana have repeatedly voiced concern over.

This year three Guyanese women filed a case against Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency to put a stop to flaring of gas offshore by the US oil major.

Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency disclosed that as of September last year it had received approximately $400 million in “flaring fees”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5teWNlbnRyYWxqZXJzZXkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL3N0dWRlbnQtb2YtdGhlLXdlZWsvMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9uai1zdHVkZW50cy12aXRvbG8td2FuYW1ha2VyLWVhcm4tZnVsbC1hdGhsZXRpYy1zY2hvbGFyc2hpcHMvNjk2ODMzNTIwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NJ students: Vitolo Wanamaker earn full athletic scholarships,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.mycentraljersey.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/news/education/student-of-the-week/2022/12/03/nj-students-vitolo-wanamaker-earn-full-athletic-scholarships/69683352007/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C490672DA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5teWNlbnRyYWxqZXJzZXkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL3N0dWRlbnQtb2YtdGhlLXdlZWsvMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9uai1zdHVkZW50cy12aXRvbG8td2FuYW1ha2VyLWVhcm4tZnVsbC1hdGhsZXRpYy1zY2hvbGFyc2hpcHMvNjk2ODMzNTIwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

But it also has a thriving software-as-a-service business.

Mention the company Fair Isaac (FICO 3.25%) and the first thing that probably comes to mind is its trademark three-digit FICO score that consumers regularly see on their credit reports. After all FICO scoring plays a critical role in how people get approved for a variety of loans.

What those who know about the FICO scores may be aware of is the other main part of Fair Isaac's business its growing software division. This segment of the company leverages predictive modeling transaction profiling decision analysis and artificial intelligence to help companies better run their business. And while the FICO scoring division is a great business it's really the software division that has driven the stock 35% higher this year and to record highs.

Let's get to know Fair Isaac's software business and see what its future might hold for the company and for the stock.

The FICO platform

Fair Isaac's software has a wide array of offerings that help financial services companies and others across many industries run their businesses more efficiently. These offerings include productivity tools machine learning models data retrieval and mapping solutions real-time data insights business outcome simulators and pre-configured solutions such as fraud prevention.

For example the credit card and payments company Discover used Fair Isaac's software solutions to reduce debit card fraud losses on its PULSE network by 40%. Truist used Fair Isaac's platform to digitize credit originations. Non-banks such as the major testing organization ACT used the software to automate test development.

Fair Isaac has also developed its FICO platform which uses cloud architecture to bring data from multiple sources together gain enhanced insights and put those to work through real-time actions and workflows. FICO has moved a lot of its software decision onto the FICO platform and is investing significantly to move nearly all of its software solutions to the FICO platform.

Selling this kind of software involves long sales cycles but the company also gets rewarded with a pretty strong moat because the software is typically sold for multi-year subscriptions. There's also a land and expand component to the model so customers can become more profitable as they expand their usage of Fair Isaac's software solutions.

Strong growth and opportunities ahead

For the year ending Sept. 30 which is Fair Isaac's fiscal cycle the company generated roughly $1.38 billion of revenue. A little more than half of that came from the FICO scoring division while nearly 41% came from software (the remainder is professional services). Software revenue grew more than 9% from the fiscal year 2021 while scores revenue grew about 8%.

But within the software division the company breaks revenue out into non-platform revenue and platform revenue from the FICO platform and looks at it on an annualized revenue run-rate (ARR) basis. Platform revenue went from 11% of ARR software revenue at the end of 2020 to about 20% at the end of September. Platform ARR also more than doubled in this same time frame.

Fair Isaac's software solutions also have an international opportunity and are used by businesses in more than 120 countries. On Fair Isaac's most recent earnings call held on Nov. 9 CEO Will Lansing said the demand for its software solutions remains solid specifically on the international side where deals are not being pushed out or downsized despite the difficult operating environment.

Lansing also said on the call that of the company's target market -- the top 200 financial institutions globally -- Fair Isaac only has slightly more than 30 customers using the platform meaning there is ample runway to grow customers. He also sees significant expansion opportunities for existing clients.

The business is heating up

The strong outlook for the software division also translated to incredibly strong guidance for the fiscal year 2023 in which Fair Isaac is guiding for double-digit percentage earnings growth. This comes after Fair Isaac already raised its guidance mid-year and bought back 2.7 million shares in the fiscal year 2022. Clearly Fair Isaac's SaaS business has been a fantastic value add to the business and is a big reason the stock continues to outperform.",,,,,,,,,,,,

All just as he entered his 30s.

""I was sitting in an operating room realizing I have so much more potential than this and really feeling like I did not have control over my life"" Onofrio said in an August YouTube video titled ""How An Anesthesiologist Became a Real Estate Mogul Worth $160 Million.""

That video has since been removed from YouTube following Onofrio's indictment on three charges of bank fraud in federal court in Minnesota last month. Federal prosecutors allege the 31-year-old Eau Claire Wis. resident's wild success story was so improbable because it was built upon a $35 million bank fraud scheme.

That's in stark contrast to the tale portrayed in numerous interviews this year on podcasts with titles such as ""The Wealthy Way"" and ""Future Flipper.""

""If you don't know Matt you need to! This guy went from 0 to over $100 million in net worth in just three years!"" wrote Ryan Pineda host of ""The Wealthy Way"" podcast in the description of an episode.

""It's absolutely crazy but true! He's shown me his bank account to prove it! This guy is legit and is killing the game!""

Through that and other media appearances Onofrio dazzled interviewers with the story of how he graduated from college in 2019 and worked as a nurse paramedic firefighter and nurse anesthetist before making an immensely profitable switch to real estate.

""I started listening to [podcast] 'Bigger Pockets' I started reading a lot of books"" Onofrio explained to one host. ""Really just started reaching out to brokers and trying to find deals.""

He credited a style referred to as ""triple-net investing"" for his fast success and described how other aspiring tycoons could follow his path with ease. Triple-net investing is considered a low-risk investment in which a tenant and property owner agree that the tenant pay all expenses associated with the property. It is billed as a means for investors to grow passive wealth.

But according to the federal indictment of Onofrio unsealed last month Onofrio defrauded banks by submitting false information to lenders financing investors' real estate deals. He is also accused of altering purchase agreements to back up higher appraisals of the properties.

Onofrio allegedly withheld information from lenders including that he was lending money to investors to help them buy the properties.

He called such loans a ""seller carry"" and directed that it not be disclosed to banks financing the investor's purchase according to charges.

On more than one occasion prosecutors say Onofrio temporarily wired funds to investors' accounts to make it appear as though they had more available assets than they truly did. The three bank fraud charges against Onofrio are for separate 2021 wire transfers of between $430000 and $9.5 million to investors applying to buy properties in St. Cloud Sauk Centre and Elk River.

Federal prosecutors are seeking to forfeit more than $35 million seized from a Rochester bank account controlled by Onofrio.

Onofrio was released on a personal recognizance bond during his first appearance in court Nov. 23. He is next due in court for an arraignment hearing Jan. 13.

""Through the course of the last few months our office on behalf of Mr. Onofrio has been in contact with the U.S. Attorney's Office so the Government would be aware of his ongoing business dealings and that he was not a flight risk. We have surrendered Mr. Onofrio's passport and he will reside at his home in Wisconsin pending the resolution of his case"" said Marsh Halberg Onofrio's attorney in a statement to the Star Tribune.

""At this point the Defense is aware of very few if any transactions where the investors have suffered actual losses at this time. We believe most of the transactions with Mr. Onofrio still maintain a positive cash flow and/or an increase in the value of the property that was purchased.""

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota would not comment last week beyond the charges filed against Onofrio.

The 2020 date the government alleges Onofrio began his scheme overlaps with the period in which another web bio described the ex-nurse as becoming ""formally retired"" because of his real estate success.

Prosecutors say he used his Northwoods Management LLC business to carry out the fraud. In May months before criminal charges would be filed against Onofrio Northwoods Management filed a federal civil suit against Matthew and Lauren Hermann Puerto Rico residents who owed money to Onofrio's business for the purchase of a property in Minneapolis.

In a third-party claim against Onofrio filed by the Hermanns — who declined to comment for this story — Matthew Hermann described Onofrio as holding himself out as an experienced investor with the ""deal of a lifetime"" for Hermann.

Hermann alleged that he only discovered the ""realities of the deal"" after purchasing the property — that it did not deliver the promised financial benefits and that Onofrio took a $1.5 million fee for the sale he was not entitled to because he was not a licensed real estate broker.

To do this Hermann claimed Onofrio entered into a purchase agreement with the property's seller for $4.75 million before getting Hermann to sign an agreement to buy it for $6.3 million.

""Then without ever actually buying the property he sat in the middle and scooped up the difference"" Hermann's attorney Daniel Eaton wrote in the complaint. ""Investments do not always go as planned; this however was more than just unmet expectations. Onofrio pushed Hermann — a novice with real estate — into this purchase with grand promises of the deal of a lifetime. The reality though was that Onofrio was the one assured to make money on the deal not Hermann.""

Court records described how Hermann and Onofrio first crossed paths at a conference in Colorado for a national organization that facilitates peer-to-peer mentoring groups.

They connected over talks about real estate as Hermann noted he just bought a duplex as an investment and wanted to invest further. Onofrio boasted about how much he makes in the field ""and even showed Hermann bank account balances showing over a million dollars.""

Over lunch the next day Onofrio brought up the eventual Minneapolis property and claimed it was undervalued by $2 million. He would loan Hermann the extra $1.5 million that Hermann needed to cover the down payment.

Hermann wouldn't get to his goal of leaving his job by just buying duplexes Onofrio said. This sale ""will light gas on the fire of where you need to go.""

""This is all about mindset"" Onofrio told Hermann according to court filings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZGVsY28udG9kYXkvMjAyMi8xMi9wai13aGVsaWhhbnMtb3Blbi1pbi1sYXdyZW5jZS1wYXJrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PJ Whelihan's Now Open in Lawrence Park Shopping Center,"The ribbon cutting ceremony Nov. 28 at the new P.J.

He grew up on Shannon Drive and after returning from six years studying and working in Albany he bought a house in the city in November 2009 where he lives with his two dogs – two doors away from his childhood home.

Sign up for the Buffalo Next free newsletter The News' Buffalo Next team covers the changing Buffalo Niagara economy. Get the news in your inbox 5 days a week.

""It’s a great neighborhood a great house and the taxes are very cheap"" said Gaughan who has worked at the Buffalo law firm Barclay Damon since 2001.

But he also loves the quieter quaint and more picturesque lifestyle of Ellicottville. ""It reminds me of a Norman Rockwell-type similar to Saratoga Springs"" Gaughan said. ""Everybody knows your name.""

So now that his firm – in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic – has changed its policy to allow its staff to work remotely much of the week he's set his sights to the south. In July he bought a 4230-square-foot home with four bedrooms on a hill close to the Holimont ski resort for $1.05 million.

""It’s the perfect situation"" Gaughan said. ""It allows professionals and other occupations to have the ability to live and work remotely.""

A new world

Gaughan is one of a growing number of urban professionals who are taking advantage of the workplace changes wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic that now allow for a more flexible life.

Instead of staying tied down to an office with a daily commute in dense areas they're leaving the hustle and bustle of the big city – whether that's New York Pittsburgh Cleveland or Buffalo – and buying homes in smaller more rural locales as long as there's reliable high-speed Internet to facilitate their work.

""I do see some people saying I can work wherever I want"" said Jerry Thompson broker-owner of Century 21 Gold Standard in East Aurora who has agents working in more rural areas including Rushford in Allegany County. ""They learned lifestyle lessons that it could all be taken away quickly.""

But in doing so they're also driving up sales prices and property values in those smaller towns and villages which have had the biggest price increases across Western New York since the spring of 2021 with prices soaring by 50% or more in just a year and a half.

Locally that includes most of rural Cattaraugus County – not only tony Ellicottville but also Little Valley Machias Salamanca South Dayton Randolph Olean Franklinville Great Valley and Allegany according to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Fed economist Jaison R. Abel said about half of the surge in home prices during the pandemic can be traced to demand caused by remote work.

""This shift to remote work is going to be one of the more important developments that’s going to be permanent out of the pandemic"" Abel said noting that 20% of all work is now done remotely.

And it's happened quickly and very recently. In fact 16 of Cattaraugus County's 22 ZIP codes reported at least a 50% increase in home prices between March 2021 and September 2022 according to data from the Zillow Home Value Index compiled by the Fed researchers. The remaining six all recorded at least a 43% jump.

The data factors in all home values not just from the handful of sales in a given rural area.

""Nobody could have predicted what we saw in that two-year period of time"" said Tina Dillon of Howard Hanna Real Estate Services in Ellicottville. ""A lot of people even from the metro Buffalo area decided to relocate to the quiet of Cattaraugus County. It gave people so many more options for their lifestyle and family.""

Melanie Pritchard an associate broker with ERA Team VP Real Estate and Holimont Realty and a former Buffalo television reporter said she had never seen so much demand in the area during her 22 years as a real estate agent. She and others on her team have sold to clients from New York City Buffalo Rochester Pittsburgh Niagara County and Ohio as well as Canada. Gaughan was one of her clients.

""We certainly saw a lot of activity"" she said. ""The Ellicottville market is the biggest draw. There were a few people that would go outside of the Ellicottville immediate area but most of them wanted to be close to Ellicottville just to able to also enjoy all the amenities here.""

Not just Cattaraugus

Luigi Rodo an agent with Hunt Real Estate Corp.'s Buffalo office said he's handled sales in Franklinville Gowanda Dunkirk and Fredonia for ""folks that are based out of Buffalo but are willing to live there because they are able to access their jobs remotely and it's more affordable living."" He's even had two clients relocate recently from New York City to Franklinville – one of whom works in a job tied to Wall Street.

""The remote work is a huge factor for a lot of folks that are doing that"" he said. ""They’re able to conduct their business and do what they’re able to do without a problem.""

But Cattaraugus wasn't the only affected area in Western New York. Farmersville Station in Allegany County saw prices rise 42% – the most of that county's 23 ZIP codes. Eight of Chautauqua County's 30 ZIP codes experienced upwards of 40% growth led by Lily Dale at 52% Stockton at 44% and both Ripley and Dewittville at 43%.

In Genesee County the range was narrower with the 13 ZIP codes seeing increases of 19% to 25% led by Corfu Pembroke and Alexander. Medina and Ridgeway had the highest growth in Orleans County at 19%. And Wyoming County had the lowest increases but it still topped out at 20% for the Village of Wyoming.

Melissa Haenle an agent with WNY Metro Roberts Realty who sells homes in Wyoming County said she got ""several phone calls just from people from New York City that really wanted to purchase out here.""

""I’ve seen it a lot from people from downstate moving up here as well as people from the suburbs of Erie County moving out to Wyoming County and Cattaraugus County"" she said. ""It wasn't the price of the houses that were of interest to them. They obviously had the money to pay. It was more having the land and having the space getting out of the suburbs and city area. A lot of people didn’t like the lockdown.""

The rising prices in rural Western New York are an offshoot of the strong price increases across the entire region. Home prices in the Buffalo metropolitan area have risen faster than almost every other metro area in the state and the New York City metro area during the entire length of the pandemic from February 2020 until September 2022 racking up a 39% increase in home prices.

Only Kingston in the Hudson Valley was higher at 53% while the national increase was 42% – a pace that Abel and three other Fed economists termed ""astonishing"" in their report. They noted that it was particularly remarkable in upstate New York where ""economic growth was sluggish well before the pandemic.""

""Home prices grew very sharply almost everywhere"" Abel said. But ""what might be surprising is that home price growth was actually most rapid in the least dense areas.""

To be sure home prices in Western New York and upstate New York in general were inexpensive to begin with so there was plenty of room to grow. And even with the run-up they're still more affordable than many parts of the country.

""Despite the extremely robust home price growth in Buffalo especially when you compare it to the history home price growth is actually below average in Buffalo"" Abel said. ""There's many parts of the country where housing got more frothy than in Buffalo or in our district as a whole.""

Cities lost appeal

Much has been made of the record-low inventory of homes for sale and the record-low interest rates that until this year were the driving forces behind the bustling home sales and soaring prices across the country. The supply of homes has been particularly tight in upstate New York and homebuilders have been unable to keep up because of worker shortages supply chain disruptions and rising material prices.

But Fed economists say there's more to it than that and they pegged it to the appeal of working from home in low-cost surroundings.

""The value of urban amenities things like going out to bars and restaurants or going to museums or even taking public transportation those fell because of fear of contagion and also because of restrictions that were put in place"" Abel said. ""So this reduced the incentive to want to live in these dense urban areas.""

Meanwhile workers and employers got used to work-from-home scenarios and many employees liked the experience. Big-city dwellers also found they wanted more room more freedom and more time with their families.

""Fundamentally the ability to work from home and the shift to work from home reduced the need to live near your job and it actually increased the demand for physical space like an extra bedroom or office"" Abel said.

Going further out

They're not just coming from New York City or Buffalo either. Take Stuart Pierson a 54-year-old fee-based financial planner from Northern Virginia. Pierson formed his firm Piedmont Capital in 2006 and has an office in Urbanna Va.

But his clientele is nationwide and even his Washington-area clients became accustomed during the pandemic to doing business with him via Zoom meetings emails and phone calls.

So while he still maintains his office much of his work is now remote which made him mobile.

""We’ve always thought about moving to a place that would afford us a more comfortable lifestyle than Northern Virginia. It’s a lot like New York City – extremely dense and high traffic"" Pierson said. ""I was looking for a combination of a great town in a great state that had all the lifestyle amenities that my family and I were looking for.""

He loves to ski so he and his wife Jordan looked at moving to Colorado. Instead they found Ellicottville and bought a 1768-square-foot house with four bedrooms in the village in October 2020 for $305000.

""We just found Western New York and Ellicottville a better choice"" Pierson said. ""And the people of Western New York have been amazingly friendly. We’ve become huge Buffalo Bills fans.""",,,,,,

The body of Athena Strand was found Friday and Tanner Lynn Horner 31 was arrested on kidnapping and murder charges after confessing to killing the girl and telling authorities where to find her body according to Wise County Sheriff Lane Akin.

Horner remained jailed Saturday on $1.5 million bond. Jail records did not list an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

Horner did not know the girl’s family according to Akin who declined to discuss a motive for the crime.

“We really can’t get into the content of the confession but I will say we have a confession” from Horner Akin said.

The girl’s stepmother had reported her missing on Wednesday from the family home near Paradise on the northwestern outskirts of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Her body was found near the town of Boyd about 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) southeast of Paradise a town of about 475 people Akin said.

James Dwyer acting special agent in charge of the FBI’s Dallas field office said FedEx cooperated with investigators.

A FedEx driver confessed to abducting and killing 7-year-old Athena Strand after he delivered a package to her family's home Wise County Sheriff Lane Akin said at a press conference Friday night.

Police found Strand's body southeast of Boyd Texas. Digital evidence and interviews lead investigators to believe that Strand died within an hour of her abduction according to Akin.

""The answers were not the answers that we would have hoped that we would have gotten. And we want to send our condolences out to the family of Athena Strand"" Akin said.

Early on in their investigation law enforcement officers knew that there was a FedEx delivery made at the same time Strand went missing Akin said.

Horner who was working as a contract FedEx driver was not related to the family and did not know the family Akin said.

Akin said law enforcement were able to get a confession from Horner saying this has been one of the ""toughest"" investigations he has ever been involved in.

""Any time there's a child that dies it just hits you in your heart. You compare that child to your own children when they were at that age.""

Law enforcement officials said they were able to locate and find Horner through digital evidence and by partnering with FedEx.

Officials said they are unaware if Horner has a prior criminal history. The investigation is ongoing.

In a statement FedEx expressed their condolences for Strand's killing.

""I don't want her to be the girl known as the one murdered and discarded by a monster"" she wrote. ""I want everyone to know every single person in this world that this is my baby and my baby was taken from me. I want everyone to know her face and her voice and just how wonderful of a person she is.""

Her mother also thanked the ""hundreds if not thousands of volunteers"" and authorities who helped locate her this week.

On Saturday December 3 2022 Bucci wrestled for the final time in Toms River New Jersey at the RWJBarnabas Health Arena which is a part of Toms River High School North on a card promoted by Stand Alone Wrestling. Bucci graduated in 1990 from Toms River High School East.

SlamWrestling photographer George Tahinos noted that it was a “really big crowd” and lively. Some of the matches included Nick Aldis vs Shawn Donavan a Sinister 6 Way the Wolves (Eddie Edwards and Davey Richards) vs The Nu Graysons and Rik Ratchet vs Jerry “The King” Lawler.

It was a busy match with the 50-year-old Nova teaming with Aron Stevens and Frankie Kazarian versus Pat Buck Brian Myers and Matt Cardona.

“Honored to have been asked to wrestle in Mike Bucci/Nova/Simon Dean’s last match!” tweeted out Matt Cardona.

Stevens posted a long thoughtful tribute to Bucci on Facebook:

In my career I never took many/any pictures. I have met a lot of people and I am fortunate enough to have a few friends. Here are two of them. Tonight was the last match of Nova/Simon Dean/ Mike Bucci. Mike was one of if not the most innovative and imitated wrestlers in the late 90s. I looked up to him. When I first signed with WWE I was 21 years old. I had never moved out of my parents house before. Mike taught me countless lessons in wrestling and in life. We enjoyed a pretty lengthy run as tag team champions in OVW and I would not have had the success I have enjoyed had it not been for him. I first met Mike when I was about 19. I wrestled him and his partner Frankie Kazarian. Frankie and I also started one week apart at Killer Kowalski’s. When I was 16 years old and walking to my first day of wrestling training Frankie always went out of his way to make me feel welcome in an extremely foreign environment for a teenager amongst grown men. Frankie and Mike also enjoyed an extremely lengthy and successful run as a tag team that traveled the world. Funny how paths sometimes cross and are intertwined. Tonight Frankie and I helped Mike close a chapter in his book. We did it in front of his family friends and hometown. I was humbled and honored he asked me to be a part of this. The best part of the night by far was his daughter in the ring presenting him with a championship belt as the crowd chanted thank you Nova. An incredible finale to an even more incredible career . Nova I meant what I said in the ring. The business is way better off because you were in it. You left pro wrestling better than you found it.

Kazarian posted on Sunday morning: “Reflecting on a great weekend. Had the honor of being in the last ever match of my former tag partner and dear friend Nova (Mike Bucci) in his home town of Toms River NJ. Wonderful and emotional night. It was a pleasure to stand by the side of all the gentlemen involved.”

Bucci initially trained under Iron Mike Sharpe and debuted in 1992.

His first big break came in 1996 when he arrived in ECW as Super Nova which then was shortened to Nova. He became part of the Blue World Order mocking the New World Order. The BWO consisted of Blue Meanie Stevie Richards and Nova. His outfits often paid tribute to his favorite superheroes.

In WWE’s developmental system Ohio Valley Wrestling Bucci was a celebrated figure in front of the camera as Nova — including a few championship runs — and behind the scenes as part of the writing team and later in talent development.

His main roster run in WWE as Simon Dean a fitness guru was memorable if not that long.

The brother of Mike Bucci Donald Bucci has been involved in the wrestling business as a promoter (Phoenix Championship Wrestling) off and on through the years as well. He posted this video from the show:

In a Facebook post made later on Sunday Mike Bucci tried to sum up the evening: “I’m going to take a day or so to decompress from the events of this weekend but last night was one of the best nights of my life both professionally and personally. I know most of you have already seen all the pictures have seen the results or maybe even came to the show. I don’t know if I can do it justice by trying to describe how great it actually was. 30 years flew by an instant. What a fitting way to wrap it up officially once and for all. I’m sure I’ll shoot a video in a day or two thanking everyone and just giving some thoughts on everything that went down. It was an unbelievable night.”

Mike Bucci left the wrestling business — mostly — and has worked in the financial industry since 2008 and is currently employed by Fifth Third Bank.

World's first solar-powered car Lightyear 0 heads to production

By Pradnesh Naik 01:26 am Dec 04 202201:26 am

What's the story Netherlands-based Lightyear has commenced the production of its first electric vehicle the '0.' It happens to be the world's first solar-powered car. The sedan has an aerodynamic design with a claimed 0.19 coefficient of drag and features an elongated and sloping coupe-like roofline. The futuristic car is covered with five square meters of solar cells on its roof for efficient energy recovery.

Context

Why does this story matter?

With sustainable mobility becoming a priority in recent years almost every automaker is developing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). While most of them rely only on the charging infrastructure to power their offerings Dutch EV start-up Lightyear has taken an alternative approach by adding solar charging capability to its first-ever vehicle. Lightyear 0 can add 70km of range per day using its solar panels.

Exteriors

The EV has aero covers for rear wheels

The 2023 Lightyear 0 has a lengthy and muscular bonnet a sleek grille swept-back LED headlights a wide air dam bumper-mounted fog lights and an elongated coupe-like sloping roofline. On the sides the EV is flanked by blacked-out pillars cameras in place of ORVMs optional (rear) aero covers and designer alloy wheels. Wrap-around and connected LED taillights are available at the rear end.

Information

It gets 4 electric motors

The Lightyear 0 is powered by a quad electric motor setup linked to a 60kWh battery pack. The EV promises a range of 625km on a single charge and an additional 70km/day from the solar panels alone. The sedan has a top speed of 160km/h.

Interiors

The sedan features sustainable upholstery and multiple airbags

Inside the Lightyear 0 has a spacious five-seater cabin and gets a minimalist dashboard design sustainable upholstery made using recycled PET bottles and vegan leather automatic climate control three small screens for rear-view camera units and a multifunctional steering wheel. The EV houses a digital instrument cluster and a 10.1-inch infotainment panel running on Android OS. Passengers' safety is ensured by multiple airbags.

Information

How much does it cost?

In the European region the 2023 Lightyear 0 solar-powered EV has a base price of €250000 (approximately Rs. 2.15 crore). The company has already received 150 pre-orders for the futuristic sedan and plans to produce one unit each week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGJpa2UuY29tL25ld3MvbGlnaHR5ZWFyLTAtd29ybGQtcy1maXJzdC1zb2xhci1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItZ29lcy1pbnRvLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tMzIwNDQ2NtIBb2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGJpa2UuY29tL25ld3MvbGlnaHR5ZWFyLTAtd29ybGQtcy1maXJzdC1zb2xhci1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItZ29lcy1pbnRvLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tMzIwNDQ2Nj9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lightyear 0 World's First Solar Electric Car Goes Into Production,"In June 2022 Dutch mobility start-up Lightyear announced its first product would be a car that could run on solar energy. At that time Lightyear also said that it would start production of this model by September in time for delivery to European customers in November this year. However the company recently announced that it has officially commenced production of the world's first solar car model called Lightyear 0. Currently this interesting car has a starting price of $259000 (Rs. 2.11 crore) and has already collected about 150 pre-orders.

According to the announcement the first 1000 Lightyear 0 units will be produced at the Valmet Automotive Oyj plant in Finland. It is expected that one Lightyear 0 vehicle will be produced each week. Lightyear 0 will have solar panels on the roof roof and trunk to maximise coverage and recharge while in operation or parked. According to Lightyear an hour in the sun can charge enough for Lightyear 0 to run nearly 10 km. The car can also run for 2 months without charging in Amsterdam in the summer. And up to 7 months with the weather in Portugal if their daily commute is less than 35 km. In a foggy climate like the Netherlands the car will need to be recharged after 2 months.

The specifications also show that Lightyear 0 will be a formidable opponent for current electric car manufacturers. The operating range of Lightyear 0 is up to 625 km according to WLTP standards. Thanks to the smart solar panel design Lightyear 0 can also run up to 70 km per day or 11000 km per year in ideal conditions even more than the Tesla Model 3 with 601 km. The battery pack equipped on Lightyear 0 has a capacity of 60 kWh but with fast charging technology the car can travel 200 km from 1-hour charging for public charging and 32 km from 1 hour for slow charging at home.

In addition the company CEO claims the powertrain on the Lightyear 0 is the most efficient in the world. The car's aerodynamic shape and four electric motors on four wheels allow for a smaller battery to still provide enough for the same range of travel. So the Lightyear 0 also has the advantage of being lightweight with only 1575 kg. Lightyear is also developing a Lightyear 2 after the Lightyear 0 with production expected in 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhza3kub3JnL3NwYWNlL21hcnMtd2F0ZXItYXN0ZXJvaWRzLWRlZXAtb2NlYW4tMXN0LWxpZmUtaW4tc29sYXItc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Mars have our solar system's 1st life? - Space,"Could Mars have been the first planet in our solar system to support life? New research suggests it’s possible. Recently EarthSky reported on a study showing that Mars was once likely a water world. It might have had oceans even before Earth did. On November 17 2022 European researchers announced a study that reaches a similar conclusion. And the new study goes a bit further suggesting that icy asteroids brought enough water to early Mars for a global ocean at least 980 feet (300 meters) deep (or deeper in some places). If so those same asteroids might have brought organic molecules needed for life to begin on a young Mars.

The researchers – at the Center for Star and Planet Formation (StarPlan) at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and other institutions in Europe – published their peer-reviewed findings in Science Advances on November 16 2022.

The study also includes researchers from the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) at the University of Paris the Institute of Geochemistry and Petrology (GeoPetro) at ETH Zürich and the University of Bern Physics Institute.

Asteroids bring water and organics to Mars

Just as with Earth asteroids bombarded early Mars. Scientists said that these asteroids transported water and organic molecules throughout the solar system. Indeed such asteroids may have played a vital role in the emergence of life on Earth. The new study said (and re-confirmed) that these asteroids brought water to Mars as well. They also carried organic molecules such as amino acids necessary for life as we know it. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Martin Bizzarro from the Center for Star and Planet Formation (StarPlan) at the University of Copenhagen said:

At this time Mars was bombarded with asteroids filled with ice. It happened in the first 100 million years of the planet’s evolution. Another interesting angle is that the asteroids also carried organic molecules that are biologically important for life.

Enough water for a deep global ocean

We know that Mars once had much more water than it does today. Lakes and rivers crossed and dotted the landscape. This and other studies support the theory that there were once oceans too. But just how much water existed on Mars’ surface and for how long is still a matter of much debate.

The new research suggests that the asteroids delivered enough water to early Mars’ surface for a global ocean at least 980 feet (300 meters) deep. In some areas the ocean could have been up to 0.62 miles (one kilometer) deep. This also includes Mars’ own water supply outgassing from the planet’s mantle at the time. As the paper explained:

Late delivery of this volatile-rich material to Mars provided an exotic water inventory corresponding to a global water layer >300 meters deep in addition to the primordial water reservoir from mantle outgassing.

Just how much of the surface water actually covered however is still uncertain. Previous research said that an ancient ocean likely covered most of the northern hemisphere in the lowlands. To this day we can see a distinct boundary between these lowlands and the more rugged cratered terrain of the southern hemisphere. As Bizzarro explained:

This happened within Mars’s first 100 million years. After this period something catastrophic happened for potential life on Earth. It is believed that there was a gigantic collision between the Earth and another Mars-sized planet. It was an energetic collision that formed the Earth-moon system and as the same time wiped out all potential life on Earth.

Clues from Martian meteorites

So how did the researchers figure out how much water Mars had a few billion years ago? It was 31 Martian meteorites that provided the valuable clues. Analysis of the meteorites showed that they used to be part of Mars’ original crust before they were blasted into space by asteroid impacts. The researchers measured the variability of a single chromium isotope (54Cr) in the meteorites. By doing so the team estimated the impact rate for Mars circa 4.5 billion years ago and how much water the asteroids delivered.

The meteorites provide a window into what Mars’ surface was like within the first 100 million years or so. On Earth plate tectonics have erased all such evidence. Bizzarro said:

Plate tectonics on Earth erased all evidence of what happened in the first 500 million years of our planet’s history. The plates constantly move and are recycled back and destroyed into the interior of our planet. In contrast Mars does not have plate tectonics such that planet’s surface preserves a record of the earliest history of the planet.

Overall the new study support previous research indicating that Mars at one time had an ocean or oceans. It may also have been a good environment for life to start – perhaps even before on Earth – thanks largely to the organic molecules that the asteroids brought as well. The red planet now cold and dry was once blue and wet … and maybe very much alive.

Bottom line: A new study from researchers in Europe says that Mars once had enough water largely brought by asteroids for a deep global ocean. The asteroids also brought organic molecules necessary for life.

When you discover that a car generates its own energy to move the vehicle while being driven you will undoubtedly think of the situation as being exceedingly unusual. But this unbelievable situation will really take place in the upcoming days.

According to Entrepreneur magazine the brainchild of a Dutch startup company the Lightyear O is a four-door electric car with over 50 square feet of solar panels on its hood and roof that can generate up to 43 miles worth of electricity per day while you drive.

Without recharging this electric vehicle can be used for months. The Lightyear O the world's first solar-powered automobile was designed by the manufacturer with such an idea in mind.

This novel concept appears to be quite appealing at a time when many electric car manufacturers are increasing the number of batteries in order to increase range. Lightyear uses a different approach attempting to harness solar energy in order to extend their range while consuming fewer batteries.

This helpful automobile is made by the same company that creates the Porsche Boxter. In Finland the first lot's production is now in progress.

""Starting production of Lightyear 0 the first solar car brings us a big step closer to our mission of clean mobility for everyone everywhere"" Lex Hoefsloot Lightyear's CEO and co-founder said in a statement. ""We may be the first to achieve this but I certainly hope we aren't the last.""

The company hopes to churn out five cars per week by the end of 2023.

As per an article published in CNNin June this year the company says the car will be able to drive around 388 miles without stopping to recharge and will have an additional range of up to 43 miles a day from the solar panels. For comparison that's slightly more than a Tesla Model 3 (374 miles) and significantly more than the Kia Niro Long Range (285 miles). Each hour in the sun will add up to six miles of charge to the battery according to Lightyear."

Now state regulators may take away NOPEC’s right to represent communities in the electricity market.

That’s because NOPEC’s rates got so high this summer that it temporarily dropped close to 550000 customers who would be better off buying electricity directly from utilities like FirstEnergy.

The decision saved residents hundreds of dollars. But it also raised big questions.

Why did NOPEC’s rates get so high while the prices offered by the utilities stayed low? Why didn’t NOPEC drop customers before they were hit with high electric bills this summer? And how did a model that worked for 20 years suddenly break?

After a complaint from a competitor state regulators are considering whether to renew NOPEC’s certificate to sell electricity. If they don’t renew it NOPEC would no longer be able to supply electricity to communities. But it would still be allowed to sell natural gas.

Despite the controversy the decision caused NOPEC CEO Chuck Keiper said temporarily dropping those customers was the right choice. He said the nonprofit’s track record of advocacy for consumer friendly legislation grants and usually competitive pricing speaks to NOPEC’s value.

“We believe all those things combined show that we’re an important and valuable partner to our communities” Keiper said.

Understanding what went wrong in 2022 means understanding NOPEC’s roots.

Buying in bulk: How NOPEC got started

In the late 1990s Ohio lawmakers started to partially deregulate the energy market changing the way Ohioans bought electricity and natural gas.

Today Ohioans can buy power on the open market from a supplier they choose.

They can’t pick their utility — the company that transports the electricity or natural gas into their homes — like Ohio Edison or the Illuminating Company.

When the rules were being created more than 20 years ago consumer advocates thought one household alone couldn’t negotiate better prices. Advocates lobbied to create the opt-out government aggregation option.

A municipality if voters approved could shop on behalf of residents. Residents would automatically be part of the city’s buying group unless they opted out.

More than 100 communities in Greater Cleveland voted to form these aggregations. Most cities then joined NOPEC which formed in November 2000 to negotiate on behalf of 95 communities at the time.

“We were the very first people to compete with privately held utility companies like FirstEnergy” Keiper said.

By spring 2001 NOPEC was buying electricity on behalf of residents. It started an opt-out natural gas program in 2002.

NOPEC is run by a board of directors that’s made up of local officials. Each NOPEC community appoints a representative and has one vote in NOPEC’s general assembly. Representatives from each county also elect a board member from that county.

Getting discounts: How has NOPEC faired over the years?

In recent years NOPEC has not always been the cheapest option. But for many years NOPEC was cheaper than the option offered by utilities called the standard service offer — usually called the “price to compare” on utility bills.

The standard service offer is variable price meant to be a safety net and the supplier of last resort. If a household picks a supplier and there is a problem — like a company going out of business — the standard service offer is there to keep the lights on.

If Ohioans don’t pick a supplier and if they don’t have local leaders or NOPEC shop for them they get this option directly from their utility.

NOPEC’s first contracts guaranteed a discount compared to the standard service offer.

From 2001 to 2005 NOPEC had a contract with Green Mountain Energy that guaranteed a discount. Then from 2006 to 2008 the PUCO through regulations paused most energy shopping and NOPEC and other aggregators couldn’t supply electricity to communities.

NOPEC resumed supplying electricity in 2009 and signed a nine-year contract with Energy Harbor (then FirstEnergy Solutions) that guaranteed a 6% discount for residents.

For example if Ohio Edison or the Illuminating Company had a 10 cents per kilowatt standard service offer. NOPEC’s price would be 9.4 cents.

These discounts lasted until 2017.

Energy Harbor cancelled its contract likely because it was losing money on the deal. It later filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was spun out as its own company separate from FirstEnergy.

NOPEC signed a new contract with NextEra Energy. The new “standard program price” was competitive in 2017 but it wasn’t tied to the prices offered by the utility.

Electricity from the utility companies was bought well in advance so much so that its price wasn’t reflective of the current electricity market.

Combine that with low wholesale prices and energy companies weren’t able to offer that kind of product according to NOPEC.

One joint study from Ohio State University and Cleveland State University chalked this up to competition.

“This shows the power of a functioning competitive market” researches wrote in the study said. “The PTC (price to compare) is now so close to the market equilibrium price that margins for aggregators and brokers are being squeezed.”

NOPEC estimates that it saved customers more than $300 million before 2019. Once the guaranteed discount program went away NOPEC spokesman Dave Jankowski said its became more difficult to track savings.

NOPEC offers four electricity products. These include cheaper 12- and 24-month contracts and a monthly-variable rate that’s cheaper than the standard service offer but enrollment is capped at 2.5% of the customers.

The vast majority of NOPEC customers 97.5% are in the “standard program price.” Those are the customers who saw price hikes this summer.

What happened when NOPEC’s rates shot up?

NOPEC CEO Keiper said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a huge part of why NOPEC and the wholesale electricity market in general saw skyrocketing prices this year. But timing was the main reason NOPEC became so much more expensive than the standard service offer.

Electricity for the standard service offer from the utilities is bought well in advance but NOPEC usually buys electricity close to when it needs it. Both methods have upsides and downsides.

A company could buy electricity at $50 per megawatt for example and lock in for one year.

If the price doubles to $100 in six months locking in saved money. But if the price drops to $25 buying in advance was a mistake.

Electricity prices in Ohio have been flat or declining for many years. Keiper said NOPEC always used a variable rate and avoided locking in a rate so it could reduce its rates as prices dropped.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February and electricity prices took a sharp turn.

By April Keiper said clouds were forming over the energy market. In July Russia closed the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which supplies natural gas to Europe for the first time.

European countries needed to find natural gas from new sources. Those customers flooded the market and drove natural gas prices higher. Much of the U.S. electricity is generated using natural gas.

“That was the point where we said the cloud wouldn’t dissipate” Keiper said. “It will only get worse.”

NOPEC was charging customers 6.95 cents a kilowatt hour in February. That jumped to 8.7 cents in May then to 9.7 cents before peaking at 12 cents in July.

The solution was to temporarily drop close to 550000 customers back to the utility which was cheaper because of timing.

Keiper said NOPEC stopped enrolling new customers in April and worked quickly to transition customers when prices shot up dramatically. He said before NOPEC could temporarily drop the customers it needed to get approval from its board of directors and had to negotiate with its supplier NextEra Energy.

NOPEC intends to send out opt-out letters in the spring so it can re-enroll customers in June 2023 when it predicts it will be competitive with the utility companies.

Why did the utilities’ standard service offer stay so cheap?

Utility companies buy electricity at auction and they do it well in advance. The electricity used in the first half of 2022 was bought in late 2020 and early 2021.

The electricity being used today was bought in August and October of 2021 and in March of 2022. Most of it bought before Russia invaded Ukraine.

The wholesale auctions have usually brought in cheap prices but that may be changing.

FirstEnergy held an auction in October and had to buy electricity at more than double the price it’s paying now. That electricity won’t be used until June 2023. Two more auctions to come will also be factored in.

The spike in prices didn’t just hurt NOPEC. About 40 other communities in Ohio that didn’t use NOPEC ended their aggregations because of high prices according to NOPEC’s filings to the PUCO.

The complaint from a competitor

Dynegy a wholesale electricity supplier and a NOPEC competitor stepped in and tried to stop NOPEC from dropping thousands of customers. Here’s why.

When FirstEnergy holds auctions it’s buying electricity from companies like Dynegy which itself is responsible for 32% of the electricity sent to FirstEnergy customers.

Dynegy is on the hook for 32% of standard service offer bucket whether that’s 10000 customers or 100000 . NOPEC dropped another 550000 customers into that bucket — and other suppliers needed to pick up the increase load and do it at a cheap fixed price already locked in.

Dynegy argues that this move would cause havoc in Ohio’s energy market something NOPEC disputes. The PUCO ultimately allowed the customers to be moved.

Keiper said Dynegy has been hypocritical because it has also ended some of its own government aggregations.

Dynegy competes with NOPEC and sells electricity directly to communities.

Mansfield was using Dynegy as its supplier but the city announced in June that Dynegy would drop customers because of “high market prices” when the contract expired in July.

In a similar move to NOPEC Dynegy customers went back to the standard service offer from Ohio Edison.

Standard service offer auctions are becoming less competitive said Noah Dormady an associate professor at Ohio State University that researches energy policy.

In the FirstEnergy auction in October only seven suppliers participated. In a Duke Energy auction for another part of the state only six showed up. These auctions normally attract twice as many bidders.

While there’s several reasons that the auctions aren’t attracting as many bidders Dormady said less companies participating and higher bids are concerning and could drive up prices for Ohioans.

So did energy deregulation save Ohioans money?

The controversy surrounding NOPEC the concern over the standard service offer and its auctions and the fact that most of this is confusing to residents raises another question. Did deregulation save Ohioans money?

The CSU/OSU study prepared for NOPEC called “Electricity Customer Choice in Ohio” - last updated in 2019 - said deregulation had saved Ohio consumers $23.9 billion since 2011.

It argues that competition has driven down the standard service offer saving Ohioans $19.5 billion. It estimates that customers who shopped for energy whether on their own or through a government aggregator like NOPEC saved an additional $4.4 billion.

But another study from Ohio State which Dormady led said deregulation has actually cost Ohio households at least $1 billion through 2016.

The studies agree on many things. The different numbers Dormady explained are because of cross-subsidies. Utility companies charge a fixed delivery cost to customers. That cost keeps going up because extra charges called riders kept being added.

The utilities kept their power plants even though they were losing lost money. But the extra costs made them whole.

“The truth of the matter is Ohio never really got deregulation in the textbook form” Dormady said.

Ned Hill an economics professor at OSU who worked on the NOPEC study agrees. He said utility companies used to make profits from making and selling energy. After deregulation they’ve clawed back that money through riders. which are approved by state regulators.

“The legal departments became the most effective revenue generators for the utility companies” Hill said.

What happens next to NOPEC?

Regulators for the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio likely won’t make a decision on NOPEC until late December. Regulators have never revoked a government aggregator’s certificate in the past.

The case is ongoing with several companies and organizations filings motions and requesting information. Mayors in Parma and Lyndhurst have sent letters in support of NOPEC. While Dynegy and other companies continue to argue that NOPEC should lose its right to do business.

It’s not uncommon for filings to come in right before the deadline which is currently Dec .12.

NOPEC going away could be a big loss for customers Hill said. Even if NOPEC isn’t cheaper per kilowatt hour it challenges FirstEnergy and forces competition in the market.

The ruling has no bearing on whether NOPEC can continue to buy natural gas on behalf of residents. In recent months NOPEC was cheapest option on natural gas but prices from the utilities saw a steep drop in September.

Keiper said NOPEC is used to being under a microscope. Because Ohio’s energy regulations are so confusing NOPEC staff often get angry and even threatening calls from people who were opted in and didn’t know it Keiper said.

He said a lot of that confusion is created by door-to-door marketers who are trying to sell customers electricity. Keiper said NOPEC is always fighting misunderstandings and misinformation.

“It’s a constant battle that never ends” he said.

NOPEC’s value isn’t just in cheaper rates Keiper said. The nonprofit also had a big hand in advocacy and pushing for consumer-friendly legislation.

In January NOPEC and the Ohio Consumer’s Counsel led a push to get $306 million refunded to energy customers.

He said NOPEC’s rate hikes were caused by a global energy crisis and not some poor choice NOPEC made.

“NOPEC doesn’t create those conditions” NOPEC said. “We work like everybody else in the conditions that the world sets.”

That's when Deshaun Watson ran onto the field with the Browns offense for the first time.

Watson returning to Houston on the same day he returned to the field after an 11-game suspension and a nearly two-year hiatus heard the boos. Those boos though faded as the game went along and the Browns pulled away for a 27-14 victory over the Texans.

""They're supposed to boo"" Watson said afterward. ""I'm a Cleveland Brown now. They're supposed to boo.""

There may have been a segment of the Houston fans whose boos were solely because of Watson wearing a Browns uniform now. However that is taking a way-too-simplistic look at the 700 days between his last time starting an NFL game — for the Texans on Jan. 3 2021 — and Sunday's return to NRG Stadium.

Yes there was a trade dispute in the spring of 2021 that led him to not playing for the duration of that season with Houston and may have created some of the ill will. What led to a lot more of the vitriol if not almost all of it had nothing to do with football.

Jadeveon Clowney:'I've never been in the guest locker room': Jadeveon Clowney also eyeing Houston return

It's the same thing that led Watson to have to wait until Sunday to finally play for his new team. The allegations of sexual assault and sexual misconduct during massage appointments by more than two dozen women led to 26 lawsuits 23 of which have been settled and one that was dropped in March 2021 and ultimately led to his 11-game suspension.

As was the case when he made his first public comments since the suspension on Thursday he wouldn't directly answer questions about the women including if with his suspension over he felt remorse for what he had done.

""Like I said before that's something legal and clinical we've been asked it before and they don't want me to address anything like that"" Watson said. ""Of course it was a tough situation. The suspension was tough but at the same time my main focus is trying to be 1-0 as a football player today.""

You can say Watson went 1-0 Sunday the same way any starting quarterback receives credit for the win when his team gets one. However whether it was due to being rattled or rusty or whatever it was a very choppy performance for the quarterback the Browns spent three first-round picks two other mid-round picks and as critical as anything $230 million guaranteed over the next five years.

Watson never really found his rhythm from his very first pass which was a short curl route to Amari Cooper that Houston's Steven Nelson broke up. He finally completed a pass on his third try a 15-yarder to Anthony Schwartz that still resulted in a fumble to set up a Texans field goal.

By the time Watson threw his final pass also an incompletion to Cooper he was 12 of 22 for 131 yards with an interception in the end zone. He finished with a quarterback rating of 53.4 which is the lowest of any game in which he's started in his career.

“I would just say I felt every single one of those 700 days honestly"" Watson said. ""However long I've been out I felt every single one of those days. Getting back in shape and everything is definitely what I needed today.”

The in-game reaction Watson received was much more audible than what greeted him during the pregame. He made his first appearance on the field a little less than two hours before kickoff to go though some light throwing.

During that time Watson talked to Texans players coaches and support staff before returning to the locker room after about 30 minutes. He stopped to sign several autographs on his way back to the locker room.

Watson returned to the field for warmups about 50 minutes before kickoff. He jogged out of the tunnel to the front corner of the end zone paused for a moment before running out onto the field to a fairly tepid response from roughly 5000 or so — many wearing Browns apparel — in the stands.

That changed once the game got underway. Then the Texans fans allowed their displeasure with Watson to be fully known.

""Like I said it is what it is"" Watson said of the response. ""I can't control the fans how they approach whenever I step on the field. My job is to go out there and execute and do my best on behalf of the team.”

Fiserv Forum will host NCAA Division I women's volleyball for the first time on Sept. 13 2023 when nationally ranked programs from Marquette University and the University of Wisconsin meet in downtown Milwaukee.Tickets for the match at the home of Marquette men's basketball and the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks go on sale in the summer of 2023.""We are thrilled to host NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball next fall for the first time"" said Peter Feigin President of the Milwaukee Bucks and Fiserv Forum. ""Marquette and Wisconsin are having outstanding seasons and their interstate rivalry will generate an exciting match next year.""Both volleyball programs are currently ranked in the top 16 of the AVCA Coaches' Poll and each earned the opportunity to host home matches in the first and second rounds of the NCAA tournament this week. The two perennial NCAA participants each won league titles this fall and the Badgers captured a national championship in 2021.The 2021 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Championship title match drew 1.2 million viewers on ESPN2 while non-conference matches this fall between Florida and Wisconsin in Madison (16833) and Creighton and Nebraska (15797) in Omaha Nebraska set regular season attendance records.In addition to men's basketball games at Fiserv Forum the building partnered with Marquette to host the 2022 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship while Wisconsin men's hockey played in the building's inaugural Kwik Trip Holiday Face-off last winter and will again on Dec. 28-29.""We are excited and looking forward to playing Marquette in Fiserv Forum next year. Last year not only did the Badgers win the Division I National Championship but we also celebrated as UW-Eau Claire won the D3 National Championship. This year Marquette and Wisconsin have both earned top-16 seeds in the NCAA tournament and both teams have enjoyed record crowds in recent seasons. In addition the club and high school volleyball participation numbers in the state are also in the midst of an explosion. The sport has never been better than it is right now and we are excited to continue this great rivalry and move it into bigger venues where more fans can experience watching the match in person. Earlier this season Wisconsin set the all-time NCAA Volleyball attendance record in a sold-out and packed Kohl Center. We are looking forward to breaking that record in a sold-out Fiserv Forum.""""This is an exciting announcement and I'm thrilled that our volleyball team will have the opportunity to play in such a terrific venue. We are always seeking impactful experiences for our student-athletes and this promises to be a special event.

It happened again Saturday at Fiserv Forum.

In a tension-packed and physical game in front of a sellout crowd of 17760 fans the Badgers survived with an 80-77 victory in overtime.

UW (6-2) had better poise and execution than MU (6-3) down the stretch in overtime. The Badgers won for the first time in Fiserv Forum after falling in overtime in 2018 during the Golden Eagles' first season in the building and then a tip at the buzzer in 2020.

""The last time I was in here I got a sick feeling in my stomach losing on that buzzer-beater"" UW's Tyler Wahl said. ""I know we were not going to come in here and lose.""

Box score: Wisconsin 80 Marquette 77 (overtime)

Chucky Hepburn makes winning plays for Badgers

Chucky Hepburn scored 19 points to lead four double-digit scorers for the Badgers. He left the game for a large chunk of the second half with an injury but returned with seven minutes to play. His biggest play came in the waning seconds of overtime when he found Max Klesmit for the go-ahead basket with 3.5 seconds left.

""I've been preparing for it"" Hepburn said. ""Working out every day. Through that shooting slump I've been working out and getting a lot more shots up and I think it's just paying off now.""

Marquette had two chances at full-court inbound plays after timeouts but Tyler Kolek's heaves were picked off by Wisconsin including one by Wahl who hit a free throw for the final margin.

""We got to find the right guy to make that pass and that catch"" MU head coach Shaka Smart said. ""We've worked on that some in practice but nowhere near enough. And that's my job to find who it makes sense to make that pass.

""And they defended it well. We were just trying to throw the ball to half court so we could have a little bit of time because there was only 3.5 and then 2-something seconds left.""

Smart also lamented his team's defense on Hepburn's assist to Klesmit. The Golden Eagles' three losses have come in their close games this season.

""We always say solid on defense take care of the ball and make your free throws"" Smart said of his team's late-game execution this season. ""The team that does that at the end of the game has a greater chance to win.

""So it was a couple times we weren't solid enough. Wahl drove by us and laid the ball up. Their last basket we had Hepburn trapped over on the side. And he's a heck of a player man I can't say enough about how much he impacted this game. Obviously he was out for a while and then came back.

""But you got to keep him over there. At one point we had three of our defenders trying to guard him and he was able to turn the corner. So we got to be more solid on defense for sure.""

Wisconsin shoots 69.6% against Marquette's defense in first half; Kam Jones sparks MU's offense with 26 points

Hepburn wasn't the only one with a hot start with Wahl also not missing a shot and scoring 11 points as UW rolled to a 41-30 lead at the break. Wahl finished with 15 points.

UW shot 16 for 23 (69.6%) in the first half including 7 for 13 on three-pointers.

The Badgers extended the lead to 46-30 early in the second half but then MU started chipping away.

Kam Jones scored a college-high 26 points to lead the Golden Eagles including a step-back three-pointer that tied the game in overtime before Klesmit's shot.

""It sucks because we fought"" Jones said. ""They shot the ball in the first half. Came out in the second half and played much better defense and much more aggressive.

""It just sucks. We fought hard it's just a play here and a play there.""

MU battled back to take lead at 68-67 on Stevie Mitchell's fast-break layup with 1:52 remaining in regulation.

After forcing a turnover by UW the Golden Eagles' Olivier-Maxence Prosper missed a good look at a three-pointer. That opened the door for Hepburn to knock down a triple to grab back the lead.

The Golden Eagles managed to get Oso Ighodaro open for a dunk on a baseline-out-of-bounds play to tie the game with 22 seconds on the clock.

Hepburn missed a contested three in the waning seconds of regulation.

Wisconsin holds a 70-59 advantage in the series with Marquette

MU and Wisconsin have been playing since 1917 and the Badgers hold a 70-59 advantage in the series.

The teams have no played seven overtime games.

""A heck of a college basketball game"" UW coach Greg Gard said. ""And really at the root of why these two institutions continue to do this is that right there. It's great for the state of Wisconsin. It's great for growing the game and putting the spotlight on our state and basketball in our state.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtdHYxNW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMDMvd2lzY29uc2luLXZvbGxleWJhbGwtcGxheS1maXNlcnYtZm9ydW0tMjAyMy1zZWFzb24v0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud210djE1bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wMy93aXNjb25zaW4tdm9sbGV5YmFsbC1wbGF5LWZpc2Vydi1mb3J1bS0yMDIzLXNlYXNvbi8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wisconsin volleyball to play at Fiserv Forum in 2023 season,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtdHYxNW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMDMvd2lzY29uc2luLXZvbGxleWJhbGwtcGxheS1maXNlcnYtZm9ydW0tMjAyMy1zZWFzb24v0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud210djE1bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wMy93aXNjb25zaW4tdm9sbGV5YmFsbC1wbGF5LWZpc2Vydi1mb3J1bS0yMDIzLXNlYXNvbi8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C4909FC3A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Ultimately the Badgers came out ahead despite Marquette erasing a double-digit halftime deficit and making for another game in the rivalry that both fanbases won’t forget for quite some time.

Here are seven awesome images from Wisconsin’s 80-77 win over the Marquette Golden Eagles at Fiserv Forum:

1. Shhhhhhh

Although Wisconsin was the hometeam in our fine city just a few weeks ago at American Family Field Fiserv Forum was a hostile environment for anyone wearing the color red on Saturday. The cheers were loud from Marquette fans – but their silence was even louder as Wisconsin’s Chucky Hepburn went off with 16 points and perfect field-goal percentage in the first half.

2. Kam he do it? Yes he Kam!

Kameron Jones was on fire Saturday leading all scorers with 26 points. The 6’4” guard put the team on his back to keep Marquette in the game despite an underwhelming first half.

3. More time for Tyler

Tyler Wahl put up five of his 15 points in overtime. Although he didn’t contribute big numbers throughout the first two halves he came up clutch at the biggest moments in overtime as the Badgers outscored Marquette 10-7 in the final minutes.

4. Red Panda

Everyone’s favorite halftime performer Rong Niu (aka Red Panda) paid a special visit to Milwaukee for the game’s halftime entertainment. The uber-talented acrobat blew us away with her seven-foot-tall unicycle catching and balancing multiple ceramic bowls on her feet and head.

5. Dimes from Kolek

Marquette guard Tyler Kolek led all players with eight assists in the game. The Rhode Island native only put up six points but he got his entire team involved by dominating control of the ball for Marquette.

6. The freshman continues to impress

Wisconsin freshman Connor Essegian had another impressive game for the Badgers. Despite playing limited minutes due to foul trouble in the second half Essegian had some huge buckets throughout the contest. Essegian had 12 points in just 22 minutes on Saturday.

7. Down goes Marquette

Despite an entertaining second half from Marquette to erase the Badgers’ big first half lead Chucky Hepburn and company were too much to handle. Hepburn built the Badgers lead with his perfect shooting in the first half and his absence in the majority of the second half allowed MU to inch back and make things interesting. Wisconsin was able to regain momentum when Chucky returned and big shots from Davis Klesmit and Wahl in the final minutes helped Wisconsin close things out in overtime.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtYmFza2V0YmFsbC9uZXdzL21hcnF1ZXR0ZS12cy13aXNjb25zaW4taG93LXRvLXdhdGNoLXNjaGVkdWxlLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLWluZm8tZ2FtZS10aW1lLXR2LWNoYW5uZWwtMjg5ODI1MTkv0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vY29sbGVnZS1iYXNrZXRiYWxsL25ld3MvbWFycXVldHRlLXZzLXdpc2NvbnNpbi1ob3ctdG8td2F0Y2gtc2NoZWR1bGUtbGl2ZS1zdHJlYW0taW5mby1nYW1lLXRpbWUtdHYtY2hhbm5lbC0yODk4MjUxOS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marquette vs. Wisconsin: How to watch schedule live stream info game time TV channel,"Who's Playing

What to Know

The Wisconsin Badgers will take on the Marquette Golden Eagles at 4:30 p.m. ET Saturday at Fiserv Forum. Marquette should still be riding high after a big victory while the Badgers will be looking to right the ship.

Wisconsin was close but no cigar on Tuesday as they fell 78-75 to the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. Wisconsin's loss came about despite a quality game from guard Chucky Hepburn who shot 6-for-12 from beyond the arc and finished with 23 points.

Meanwhile Marquette made easy work of the Baylor Bears on Tuesday and carried off a 96-70 win. Marquette's success was spearheaded by the efforts of forward Olivier-Maxence Prosper who had 24 points along with five rebounds and guard Kam Jones who had 20 points.

Wisconsin is expected to lose this next one by 5.5. Those burned by picking them against the spread on Tuesday might want to keep in mind that the squad has not yet dropped back-to-back games against the spread this season.

The Badgers are now 5-2 while the Golden Eagles sit at 6-2. A couple offensive stats to keep an eye on: Wisconsin has only been able to knock down 38.30% percent of their shots which is the 349th lowest field goal percentage in college basketball. Marquette's offense has more to brag about as they they rank 33rd in college basketball when it comes to points per game with 82.3 on average. So the cards are definitely stacked in their favor.

There have been reams of copy written on all the sins of our nation’s automakers but rarely are there accolades when they hit the bullseye. Obviously Detroit automakers rule in trucks and SUVs but not much has been written about their complete and total domination of the sporty coupe segment aka pony cars.

After Lee Iacocca invented the pony car segment with the Ford Mustang in 1964 GM and Chrysler emulated the formula with the Camaro/Firebird and Barracuda/Challenger respectively and all soared up the sales charts. When the mid-1970s arrived with emission controls and federally mandated safety requirements Detroit began to rest on its laurels with disastrous results.

The Mustang grew from a lithe pony to a hefty Clydesdale and Chrylser’s E-body was emasculated and then euthanized. GM wisely stayed the course and updated the second-generation F-body but Ford’s Mustang II in 1974 was a misstep and Chrysler christened a lowly Mitsubishi coupe as a new-age Challenger.

In the meantime Japan smelled blood in the water and invaded the North American market with an onslaught of pony car competitors. The Toyota Celica Honda Prelude Nissan 240SX Izuzu Impulse Diamond Star Motors twin Mitsubishi Starion Subaru XT and XVS were suddenly on every corner and each sale was a bite out of Detroit’s hide. Germany got into the game as well with the Porsche 944 3-Series C-Class and Audi A4. From there the segment invented by and dominated by Detroit was divvied up into a multinational multi-slice market.

By the early 1990s things started to change. GM and Ford fielded new pony cars in 1993 and 1994 respectively although Chrysler was still peddling rebadged Mitsubishi models. Then we lost the F-body in 2002 and the domestic pony car market was suddenly a single-entrant segment with the Mustang.

When 2005 came around we got a new retro Mustang that was heavily steeped in design cues from the 1960s. It was wildly successful and had the country wondering why it took Detroit decades to figure out that folks wanted old-school instantly recognizable pony cars. Then Chrysler dropped the 2008 Challenger and turned the segment on its ear. Here was a true heir apparent to Mopar’s glorious past designed and built in North America with a stinkin’ HEMI no less. It was a smash hit.

With all the commotion from the new retro Mustang and Challenger General Motors was now fully awake and smelling the barn if you will. The new Camaro debuted in 2010 with LS power and provocative styling lifted from the classic first generation. The pent-up demand from Bow Tie fans that waited eight long years was palpable and they snapped up the new model in droves.

Like an asteroid hitting the market almost all of those previously mentioned Japanese and German pony car competitors went extinct. Not only did Detroit hit the sweet spot with styling and performance but the cars were light years ahead in assembly quality and drivability.

Then all hell broke loose with a horsepower war that dwarfed anything from the heyday of the 1960s. All of a sudden 400-800 horsepower variants were commonplace at your local domestic dealer. In fact we say that the last fifteen years will be remembered as the true golden era of Detroit performance.

Since then Detroit dominates the sporty coupe market in North America like it owns the truck and SUV segments. Although Covid-19 crushed demand for all cars the pony car segment shriveled accordingly but is now starting to pick up. Over the last two decades Detroit has sold hundreds of thousands of very profitable pony cars with margins that any global automaker would jealously covet.

Fast forward to 2022 and the world is hurtling to an all-electric future. With internal combustion engines on death row how will Detroit reinvent the pony car for our brave new world? What strategy will prevail ICE or electric? Staying in the segment and continuing with gas engines or hitting the reset button and going with a clean sheet EV platform? Let’s look at each modern pony car and get to the bottom of this equation.

Dodge recently announced the end of the Challenger a car along with the Charger has grown to define the brand. With their “Last Call” marketing blitz Stellantis will make sure they get top dollar for every Challenger until the last one rolls off the line at the end of 2023. The incredible array of model variants deployed for Challenger is the stuff of legends. When the ICE Challenger goes to the great boneyard in the sky in 2023 it will have had an incredible 15-year production run. Heavy doses of marketing adrenochrome have kept this old muscle car atop the sales charts way past its expiration date and will be studied by marketing majors for years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9jYXJzL2ZvcmQvMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9sYXRlc3QtZm9yZC1zdXBlci1kdXR5LW9yZGVycy1zZXQtaW5zYW5lLXBhY2UvNjk2OTU3ODAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latest Ford Super Duty orders set 'insane' pace,"Ford Super Duty trucks did it again.

The Dearborn automaker shattered a sales record for the month of November after reaching a record-setting pace of 52518 new orders for the 2023 Super Duty pickup in the last five days of October when it averaged more than 10000 trucks a day according to monthly sales data.

But the November sales report nearly triples that figure.

Ford now has orders for 151870 Super Duty trucks since the order bank opened Oct. 27 the company revealed Friday.

""The demand is just insane"" said Todd Dunn president of UAW Local 862 whose members build the vehicle at the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville. ""A lot of people love those vehicles for farms hauling. It's a beast.""

After taking 52581 orders in October Ford saw an additional 99229 orders in November.

""This would be a record"" said Erich Merkle U.S. sales analyst at Ford. ""It's crazy.""

These are not reservations; these are orders placed through Ford car dealerships on behalf of actual customers who have decided to purchase the vehicle. Technically it isn't counted as a sale by Ford until the vehicle is delivered but the factory is tooled up to fulfill all these orders.

Buyers had to place their orders through dealers rather than online unlike the Mustang Mach-E or F-150 Lightning.

""We've never had this kind of activity"" Merkle told the Free Press. ""It's like taking your food truck to a site and thinking you'll be there all day but you're done after 15 minutes.""

Ford is no stranger to trucks. Thanks to the F-150 it is known as an industry leader in truck manufacturing.

But the Super Duty is a whole different animal.

The Super Duty pickup has a base price of $43970 (plus $1795 in destination fees) that often climbs past $90000 depending on amenities selected by the buyer. Options include type of engine wheels tires cloth or leather interior display screen size and massaging seats.

While all F-Series trucks are the backbone of Ford the Super Duty brings in super dollars.

From January through November this year Super Duty production averaged approximately 26000 to 27000 vehicles per month according to a news release posted Friday on Ford's investor affairs website.

Merkle noted that the orders taken in just over one month represent five to six months of production.

And the company is working to adjust builds on all production lines to get the customers these Super Duty trucks as quickly as possible Dunn told the Free Press.

Factory workers ""come to work get 'er done go home to sleep and start all over again"" he said.

The Super Duty is used in various commercial industries including utility companies emergency response mining and quarry forestry and construction. These rugged Super Duty trucks are built for really heavy towing hauling plowing and off-road driving for work.

During America's Thanksgiving Parade in Detroit Ford engineers drove the Super Duty truck and noticed comments from onlookers about new design features. Generating the most buzz engineer Peter Bejin said that day was the step that allows people to access the truck bed without lowering the tailgate.

Marick Masters a business professor at Wayne State University said Ford has a high-stakes interest in maintaining the appeal of the Super Duty that goes beyond just happy customers who want a pickup with a traditional internal combustion engine that pulls enormous loads of weight.

These are the products that fund the future at Ford in electrification and technology research he said.

""This bodes well for the company's future"" Masters said. ""The sheer volume of orders is particularly surprising. It's very important for the company to have high levels of sales in these profitable areas.""

Also Friday Ford released November sales data that showed the company is the best-selling brand and manufacturer of electric vehicles after Tesla:

F-150 Lightning sold 2062 trucks in November — and 13258 to date.

E-Transit vans sold 654 for the month and 5811 year-to-date dominating the electric van segment.

Mach-E sold 3539 SUVs with global production topping 150000.

The 2023 Ford F-Series Super Duty trucks which go on sale early next year are built by UAW members at Kentucky Truck as well as the Ohio Assembly Plant in Avon Lake.

Henry Taylor who made a name for himself by racing in a multitude of series worked as Ford’s Competition Manager at the time. He had plenty of experience with the Blue Oval’s cars in rallying having raced the Anglia Escort and Cortina prior to joining the Ford Motor Company in 1965. Taylor is widely considered the father of the Escort Twin Cam which is named this way after the four-pot engine’s Lotus-designed cylinder head.Before going any further it should be highlighted that Rallye Sport didn’t start with the Escort RS 1600. Developed by Ford UK’s Advanced Vehicle Operations the Escort RS 1600 can thank the Taunus 15M RS for the Rallye Sport moniker. Developed by Ford’s German division the original is the opposite of desirable due to its underpowered V4 andlayout.Turning our attention to the Twin Cam we’re dealing with a Kent inline-four iron block topped by an aluminum cylinder head with a dual-overhead-camshaft valvetrain. The mastermind behind the Twin Cam is a gentleman by the name of Harry Mundy. Thehead was intended for the Pont-a-Mousson mill of the Facel Vega Facellia 1600 but financial problems at the French automaker prevented this design to reach series production. When Lotus founder Colin Chapman heard of the failed collaboration he commissioned Mundy to adapt the eight-valve head for the Kent.The combined efforts of many other people including Keith Duckworth of Cosworth DFV fame made the Twin Cam a reality. The first engine was ready for testing in October 1961 and funnily enough the crankshaft broke due to the three-main-bearing block. The first test vehicle to receive this four-cylinder lump was an Anglia. Racing legend Jim Clark reportedly drove said test vehicle from Goodwood to his home in Scotland at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour (make that over 160 kilometers per hour).The 9.5:1 compression ratio Weber carburetors and four-into-one exhaust manifold unlocked 110 horsepower at 6000 revolutions per minute and 107 pound-feet (145 Nm) of torque at 4500 revolutions per minute. The 1558-cc motor was joined by a four-speed manual transmission namely the Type 3 2000E. A hydraulic clutch also needs to be mentioned plus an open diff. As opposed to the FWD Taunus 15M RS the Escort Twin Cam is RWD.Ford of Europe switched to front-wheel drive in 1980 with the third generation and the Escort would be discontinued in 2004 in favor of the Focus. The Escort moniker would be revived in 2015 in the Chinese market where the Focus-based Escort is manufactured by the Changan-Ford JV.Gifted with a 2400-millimeter (94.5-inch) wheelbase the Escort Twin Cam features a trunk-mounted battery. Rated at 9 imperial gallons which is 10.8 freedom gallons or 40.9 liters the fuel tank is located opposite to the battery. To make room for the rear carburetor the brake master cylinder and clutch master cylinder had to be relocated. Even the transmission tunnel had to be modified. Riding lower than the Escort 1300 GT this fellow employs 244-mm (9.6-in) front brake rotors and 229-mm (9.0-in) drums out back.The front end of the Escort Twin Cam rocks MacPherson struts coil springs track control arms and an anti-roll bar whereas the live rear axle uses Cortina-sourced radius arms semi-elliptic leaf springs and telescopic dampers. Shared with the Lotus Cortina the 13- by 5.5-inch steelies with chrome hub caps were originally mounted with Dunlop SP rubber boots.Boasting a two-piece front bumper and black-finished front grille the Escort Twin Cam further sweetens the deal with rectangular headlights as opposed to the circular headlights of lesser Escorts. Black vinyl upholstery an 8000-rpm tachometer a speedometer that goes to 140 miles per hour (225 kilometers per hour) a heater and two-speed wipers were standard.Produced between 1967 and 1971 the Escort Twin Cam tips the scales at 1731 pounds (785 kilograms). Capable of hitting 60 miles per hour (97 kilometers per hour) in the high 8-second range the predecessor of the Escort RS 1600 tops 113 miles per hour (182 kilometers per hour). A close-ratio transmission with four forward gears was optional as were an auxiliary fuel tank duralumin oil sump guard and performance exhaust.Options further included bucket seats an oil cooler a high-ratio steering rack various rear-axle ratios a fiberglass hood and trunk lid 6.0-inch-wide Minilite magnesium-alloy wheels an uprated oil pump and performance-oriented internals for the engine. What’s more the Boreham-based Ford Performance Centre made a case for adjustable telescopic dampers for the rear end a limited-slip differential and performance-oriented brake pads.Escort Twin Cam production came to a halt in 1971. No fewer than 1263 units were produced of which the first 883 featured rectangular headlights. The remaining 380 were originally equipped with circular headlights."

Here is what Headwaters Capital had to say about Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) was founded in 1999 and provides vulnerability management software to both SMBs and enterprise customers. Vulnerability management software provides a continuous view of security and compliance across all of a company’s assets including on-premise end-points cloud and mobile. The easiest way to think about QLYS’s original VM solution is that it provided a dashboard that monitored all potential threats to a network and helped IT departments prioritize which vulnerabilities were the highest risk. QLYS was a pioneer in the industry as they were one of the first companies to offer a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) solution as opposed to the traditional license offerings that proliferated at the time. While QLYS’ VM software has always provided an industry leading dashboard to monitor weaknesses it provided limited functionality to respond to these vulnerabilities. More recently QLYS has increased the functionality of its software through the rollout of Detection and Response capabilities (VMDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities in late 2021. The cybersecurity space has been marked by a preference of customers for point solution expertise as opposed to a winner take all solution. This market structure is driven by the complex nature of assets that need protection the dynamic nature of security threats and the critical nature of cybersecurity which leads to a customer preference for quality over cost. Historically cybersecurity was best served by firewalls which provided a ring fence around assets that were physically located on a network. Firewalls are increasingly becoming obsolete in the cybersecurity world as the network perimeter has effectively disappeared due to the growing adoption of SaaS solutions and new connected devices that connect to the network from multiple new endpoints. This trend has only accelerated following COVID. As more devices and software tools connect from outside of the traditional firewall perimeter the importance of security monitoring tools such as VM VMDR and XDR has increased. In many ways vulnerability management is the foundation of cybersecurity as it provides the dashboard for monitoring all potential security gaps. QLYS’ software can provide critical data about which assets are exposed to specific threats and can increasingly help IT departments prioritize and remediate these vulnerabilities. Understanding QLYS’s history is important to gaining confidence in QLYS’ ability to maintain revenue growth going forward. QLYS was almost perfectly positioned earlier this decade to take advantage of both the transition in the software market from license to SaaS solutions as well as the cybersecurity trend away from firewalls as devices increasingly moved beyond a physical perimeter. Given the large TAM industry tailwinds and a market leading product QLYS was able to growth revenues at a +20% CAGR from 2012-2018. Even more impressive QLYS was able to accomplish this growth with limited investment in R&D or its sales force. R&D as a percentage of revenues declined from 22% in 2012 to 16% in 2018 while S&M declined from 40% in 2012 to 22% in 2018. Consequently QLYS operates with one of the highest EBITDA margins in the industry at 45%. The ability for QLYS to post such consistent revenue growth despite under-investing in product development and sales is evidence of the strong competitive positioning of QLYS’ software and the critical nature of the product…” (Click here to read more)

Here is what Upslope Capital had to say about CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) provides specialized technology and consulting services primarily to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. The U.S. Army is CACI’s single largest customer. This position replaces BWXT in Upslope’s “defense basket” (articulated in Q1 on p. 4). CACI’s business is mostly split across Expertise (providing talent to government agencies – e.g. software engineers) and Technology (design and delivery of specific technology-oriented services and products including for example battlefield hardware). The company offers its services and products in support of both day-to-day agency operations and specific missions. At a high-level CACI reminds me of another Upslope long in an unrelated sector: Silgan Holdings (packaging/dispensing and food can business). Both are truly sleepy value stocks that trade for low doubledigit earnings multiples but have a strong history of steady value creation and free cash flow per share growth. Both the stocks and underlying businesses appear very well-positioned for the uncertain macro (or geopolitical in CACI’s case) environment we’re likely to face in the years ahead. Other notable thesis points for CACI specifically:

Long-term Geopolitical & Other Tailwinds – like other components of Upslope’s defense basket CACI should benefit from an attractive defense spending environment for years to come. CACI should also benefit from IT modernization efforts in U.S. government agencies as well as its strength in cyber/electronic warfare offerings…” (Click here to read the full text)

Earlier last year the company had released a free Domain Name System (DNS) with an IP Address of 1.1.1.1. After a few months Cloudflare also rolled out Android and iOS apps of the privacy-focused DNS resolver service. Now with Warp VPN the company hope to provide faster internet experience taking care of the privacy of the users.

Cloudflare is marketing Warp as “VPN for people who don’t know what V.P.N stands for.” The company also claims that most of the free VPN services are slow due to the higher number of users and slower internet connection.

What is a VPN?

If you have never tried a VPN or are new to this term let me make it easy for you. A Virtual Private Network or VPN is used to create a secure connection to another network. It basically creates a tunnel from your device to the destination and ensures that no one can see or modify the traffic. VPN uses encryption and several other security mechanisms to protect the network and the transmitted data.

Cloudflare has already added the Warp to the existing 1.1.1.1 app and can be used with the Cloudflare DNS. As there are already many VPN services available out there the company claims that Warp is a new mobile-only VPN service and so it will be faster than others.

According to Matthew Price CEO of Cloudflare “Technically Warp is a VPN. However we think the market for VPNs as it’s been imagined to date is severely limited. Imagine trying to convince a non-technical friend that they should install an app that will slow down their Internet and drain their battery so they can be a bit more secure. Good luck.” “If you now open the 1.1.1.1 app and enable Warp instead of just DNS queries being secured and optimized all Internet traffic is secured and optimized.” He also added.

Warp will Provide Reliability and Faster Connection Speed

The new VPN service will not only provide more privacy online but also improve reliability and connection speeds over the other VPN connections. With Warp the connection is not only protected to the browser only but also to other traffic via apps.

Beside encrypting all the traffic Cloudflare focused on the performance of the Warp VPN impressively. “Warp incorporates all the work that the team from Neumob has done to improve mobile Internet performance. We’ve built Warp around a UDP-based protocol that is optimized for the mobile Internet. We also leveraged Cloudflare’s massive global network allowing Warp to connect with servers within milliseconds of most the world’s Internet users” Prince wrote in the blog post.

Cloudflare also promises to keep all the previous privacy protections intact with the addition of Warp with 1.1.1.1 app. These include: they will not write user-identifiable log data to disk they won’t sell your information there’s no need to provide any personal information to use the app and lastly they also promised to regularly hire third-party auditors to ensure they’re living up to these promises.

The basic version of Warp is included as a free update to the 1.1.1.1 DNS app. However the company is also working on a premium version called Wrap+.

This version will utilize the company’s virtual private backbone and Argo technology and expected to be even faster than the free version. Cloudflare also has plans for launching the desktop version of this app soon. You can install the 1.1.1.1 app from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store for free.",,,,,,

The Fox Corp.-backed network confirmed Saturday that Trump wife to President Donald Trump‘s younger son Eric was no longer an official contributor to the network which hired her in the role in the spring of 2021.

“We appreciate Lara’s valuable contributions across Fox News Media programming” the company said in a statement. Fox News’ decision was previously reported by The Los Angeles Times.

Fox News has long maintained a policy that prohibits people from being contributors when they announce a campaign for public office. In this case since Donald Trump has announced his intention to run once again for president the network’s rules bar Lara Trump from being paid for her commentary. She could conceivably appear on the air in an unpaid capacity as she did when Donald Trump ran during the 2020 campaign.

Popular on Variety

She exits the role as many media outlets backed by Rupert Murdoch appear to have soured on Donald Trump. He has been criticized in recent months by the editorial pages of both The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. Both are published by News Corp. a corporate sibling to Fox Corp. Both companies are controlled by the Murdoch family.

Even some Fox News outlets which have not targeted Trump in recent months have been harsh toward the former president. Last month Lara Trump appeared on Fox Business Network after her father-in-law announced his candidacy for the 2024 election. Anchor Stuart Varney told her that “I’m sure you’re very supportive of your father-in-law but to those of us on the outside looking at it it didn’t seem as though he’s got the old magic you know what I mean?” Lara Trump pushed back: “Oh well I highly disagree with that.”

Her contributor role had long been something to monitor. When she joined Fox News in an official capacity in 2021 she was considering running for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvZm94LWRpcmVjdHYtY2FycmlhZ2UtZGVhbC1uZmwtd29ybGQtY3VwLTEyMzUxODc4MzMv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9mb3gtZGlyZWN0di1jYXJyaWFnZS1kZWFsLW5mbC13b3JsZC1jdXAtMTIzNTE4NzgzMy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DirecTV And Fox Reach Carriage Renewal Averting Blackout,"Fox Corp. and DirecTV agreed to a multi-year carriage renewal agreeing to extend talks for several hours beyond the prior deal’s expiration in order to avoid a blackout of several networks and local stations.

The new agreement covers FS1 FS2 Big Ten Network Fox Deportes Fox Soccer Plus as well as retransmission consent for local Fox Television Stations across DirecTV DirecTV Stream and U-verse. The stations are in major cities in 18 markets including New York and LA. Financial terms were not disclosed.

The official deadline passed at midnight PT on Friday but a short-term extension was put in place to enable the parties to continue negotiating. The talks coincided with a number of high-profile sporting events being carried by Fox Sports including NFL and college football games and soccer’s World Cup.

DirecTV is among the country’s largest pay-TV operators with more than 13 million U.S. households. It is owned by AT&T and private equity firm TPG in a privately held entity after a 2021 spinoff from AT&T. While the company has experimented with internet-distributed TV bundles over the years especially during the six-year period when AT&T fully owned and operated it the vast majority of its subscribers remain on traditional satellite-delivered systems.

The carriage resolution comes during a particularly active time for Fox with live sports. The company is in the midst of another successful NFL season with the late-Sunday afternoon games on Fox often leading the weekly ratings. World Cup soccer matches have drawn large viewership on the Fox broadcast network as well as cable’s FS1. Football’s Big Ten Championship will be contested between Michigan and Purdue on Saturday night. Michigan’s victory over archrival Ohio State last weekend delivered a record audience for a Fox regular-season game with 17 million viewers.

Last Sunday Fox Corp. decided to proactively start notifying viewers across several of its networks of the looming deadline putting messages in a crawl across the screen on FS1 the Big Ten Network and Fox News. The distribution negotiations did not actually include Fox News but Fox still sought to make use of its sizable tune-in to spread the word as it has done in other runups to carriage deadlines.

Fox has repeatedly reminded investors that it is in a period of renewals of almost all of its pay-TV deals describing that process as a tailwind given the continued popularity of much of its programming and the expectation for carriage fee increases. Due to the sensitivity of the distribution negotiations specific terms and even basic facts like contract deadlines are often withheld from Wall Street and the press. Eventually the proceeds from carriage deals are reported as part of affiliate revenue a line item which accounted for 49% of the company’s total revenue of $14 billion in fiscal 2022 a greater share than advertising.

Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said during the company’s quarterly earnings call with Wall Street analysts last month that the company is only at the beginning of what he called a “massive three-year cycle” of affiliate renewals. Despite pressure on programmers given ratings declines and accelerating cord-cutting Fox has maintained it will stay aggressive in its dealings with distributors. In a statement last Sunday DirecTV said Fox was engaging in methods it deemed all too familiar. In announcing the agreement today an email from DirecTV underlined that view. “As expected” it said “we renewed with Fox without affecting the entertainment experience for our customers while still holding the line against the usual scare tactics.”

The network which is backed by Fox Corp. confirmed Saturday that Trump who had been hired by the network in the spring of 2021 was no longer an official contributor.

""We appreciate Lara's valuable contributions across Fox News Media programming"" the company said in a statement.

Fox News prohibits people from being contributors to the network when they announce a run for public office as a matter of policy.

Since the former president is running for the 2024 Republican nomination the policy bars Lara Trump from being paid for commentary even though she is a family member and not the candidate herself.

Fox Corp. is owned by the Murdoch family whose media outlets which include Fox the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal have turned on the former president and have been highly critical of him as of late. The Post and Journal are published by News Corp. which is also controlled by the Murdochs.

“Fox Corporation and DIRECTV today announced a multi-year renewal of FS1 FS2 Big Ten Network Fox Deportes Fox Soccer Plus and retransmission consent for each of the Fox Television Stations across DIRECTV DIRECTV STREAM and U-verse” Fox says at the web site KeepFox.com which was established to spotlight the carriage dispute.

The two sides had engaged in a public war of words since last Sunday when Fox began posting viewer alerts that DIRECTV DIRECTV Stream and U-verse could lose the Fox-owned local affiliates in 18 markets as well as FS1 FS2 Big Ten Network Fox Deportes and Fox Soccer Plus. The network said the deadline for a new deal was Friday December 2 at midnight.

However after the midnight deadline the channels remained on DIRECTV and the TV Answer Man learned that the two sides had agreed to a short-term extension.

With the new deal DIRECTV subscribers in the 18 Fox-owned markets can be assured of watching Fox’s continued coverage of the NFL college football championship season and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

FOX,Fox Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi90di9uZXdzL2ZveC1uZXdzLWxhcmEtdHJ1bXAtMTIzNTQ0OTE3NC_SAURodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjIvdHYvbmV3cy9mb3gtbmV3cy1sYXJhLXRydW1wLTEyMzU0NDkxNzQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox News Parts Ways With Contributor Lara Trump,"Lara Trump a vociferous supporter of her father-in-law and his policies when he campaigned for re-election to the White House in 2020 is parting ways as an official contributor to Fox News Channel.

The Fox Corp.-backed network confirmed Saturday that Trump wife to President Donald Trump‘s younger son Eric was no longer an official contributor to the network which hired her in the role in the spring of 2021.

“We appreciate Lara’s valuable contributions across Fox News Media programming” the company said in a statement. Fox News’ decision was previously reported by The Los Angeles Times.

Fox News has long maintained a policy that prohibits people from being contributors when they announce a campaign for public office. In this case since Donald Trump has announced his intention to run once again for president the network’s rules bar Lara Trump from being paid for her commentary. She could conceivably appear on the air in an unpaid capacity as she did when Donald Trump ran during the 2020 campaign.

Popular on Variety

She exits the role as many media outlets backed by Rupert Murdoch appear to have soured on Donald Trump. He has been criticized in recent months by the editorial pages of both The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. Both are published by News Corp. a corporate sibling to Fox Corp. Both companies are controlled by the Murdoch family.

Even some Fox News outlets which have not targeted Trump in recent months have been harsh toward the former president. Last month Lara Trump appeared on Fox Business Network after her father-in-law announced his candidacy for the 2024 election. Anchor Stuart Varney told her that “I’m sure you’re very supportive of your father-in-law but to those of us on the outside looking at it it didn’t seem as though he’s got the old magic you know what I mean?” Lara Trump pushed back: “Oh well I highly disagree with that.”

Her contributor role had long been something to monitor. When she joined Fox News in an official capacity in 2021 she was considering running for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvZm94LWRpcmVjdHYtY2FycmlhZ2UtZGVhbC1uZmwtd29ybGQtY3VwLTEyMzUxODc4MzMv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9mb3gtZGlyZWN0di1jYXJyaWFnZS1kZWFsLW5mbC13b3JsZC1jdXAtMTIzNTE4NzgzMy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DirecTV And Fox Reach Carriage Renewal Averting Blackout,"Fox Corp. and DirecTV agreed to a multi-year carriage renewal agreeing to extend talks for several hours beyond the prior deal’s expiration in order to avoid a blackout of several networks and local stations.

The new agreement covers FS1 FS2 Big Ten Network Fox Deportes Fox Soccer Plus as well as retransmission consent for local Fox Television Stations across DirecTV DirecTV Stream and U-verse. The stations are in major cities in 18 markets including New York and LA. Financial terms were not disclosed.

The official deadline passed at midnight PT on Friday but a short-term extension was put in place to enable the parties to continue negotiating. The talks coincided with a number of high-profile sporting events being carried by Fox Sports including NFL and college football games and soccer’s World Cup.

DirecTV is among the country’s largest pay-TV operators with more than 13 million U.S. households. It is owned by AT&T and private equity firm TPG in a privately held entity after a 2021 spinoff from AT&T. While the company has experimented with internet-distributed TV bundles over the years especially during the six-year period when AT&T fully owned and operated it the vast majority of its subscribers remain on traditional satellite-delivered systems.

The carriage resolution comes during a particularly active time for Fox with live sports. The company is in the midst of another successful NFL season with the late-Sunday afternoon games on Fox often leading the weekly ratings. World Cup soccer matches have drawn large viewership on the Fox broadcast network as well as cable’s FS1. Football’s Big Ten Championship will be contested between Michigan and Purdue on Saturday night. Michigan’s victory over archrival Ohio State last weekend delivered a record audience for a Fox regular-season game with 17 million viewers.

Last Sunday Fox Corp. decided to proactively start notifying viewers across several of its networks of the looming deadline putting messages in a crawl across the screen on FS1 the Big Ten Network and Fox News. The distribution negotiations did not actually include Fox News but Fox still sought to make use of its sizable tune-in to spread the word as it has done in other runups to carriage deadlines.

Fox has repeatedly reminded investors that it is in a period of renewals of almost all of its pay-TV deals describing that process as a tailwind given the continued popularity of much of its programming and the expectation for carriage fee increases. Due to the sensitivity of the distribution negotiations specific terms and even basic facts like contract deadlines are often withheld from Wall Street and the press. Eventually the proceeds from carriage deals are reported as part of affiliate revenue a line item which accounted for 49% of the company’s total revenue of $14 billion in fiscal 2022 a greater share than advertising.

Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said during the company’s quarterly earnings call with Wall Street analysts last month that the company is only at the beginning of what he called a “massive three-year cycle” of affiliate renewals. Despite pressure on programmers given ratings declines and accelerating cord-cutting Fox has maintained it will stay aggressive in its dealings with distributors. In a statement last Sunday DirecTV said Fox was engaging in methods it deemed all too familiar. In announcing the agreement today an email from DirecTV underlined that view. “As expected” it said “we renewed with Fox without affecting the entertainment experience for our customers while still holding the line against the usual scare tactics.”

The network which is backed by Fox Corp. confirmed Saturday that Trump who had been hired by the network in the spring of 2021 was no longer an official contributor.

""We appreciate Lara's valuable contributions across Fox News Media programming"" the company said in a statement.

Fox News prohibits people from being contributors to the network when they announce a run for public office as a matter of policy.

Since the former president is running for the 2024 Republican nomination the policy bars Lara Trump from being paid for commentary even though she is a family member and not the candidate herself.

Fox Corp. is owned by the Murdoch family whose media outlets which include Fox the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal have turned on the former president and have been highly critical of him as of late. The Post and Journal are published by News Corp. which is also controlled by the Murdochs.

The Murdochs according to reports prefer Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as the 2024 GOP nominee for president.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdHZhbnN3ZXJtYW4uY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMDMvZm94LWNoYW5uZWxzLWFyZS1zdGlsbC1vbi1kaXJlY3R2LXdoYXQtZG9lcy10aGF0LW1lYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DIRECTV & Fox Sign Multi-Year Deal; No Blackout Of Channels,"Fox and DIRECTV have announced they have signed a multi-year agreement that will enable the satcaster to continue carrying Fox-owned local affiliates in 18 markets as well as FS1 FS2 Big Ten Network Fox Deportes and Fox Soccer Plus.

“Fox Corporation and DIRECTV today announced a multi-year renewal of FS1 FS2 Big Ten Network Fox Deportes Fox Soccer Plus and retransmission consent for each of the Fox Television Stations across DIRECTV DIRECTV STREAM and U-verse” Fox says at the web site KeepFox.com which was established to spotlight the carriage dispute.

The two sides had engaged in a public war of words since last Sunday when Fox began posting viewer alerts that DIRECTV DIRECTV Stream and U-verse could lose the Fox-owned local affiliates in 18 markets as well as FS1 FS2 Big Ten Network Fox Deportes and Fox Soccer Plus. The network said the deadline for a new deal was Friday December 2 at midnight.

However after the midnight deadline the channels remained on DIRECTV and the TV Answer Man learned that the two sides had agreed to a short-term extension.

With the new deal DIRECTV subscribers in the 18 Fox-owned markets can be assured of watching Fox’s continued coverage of the NFL college football championship season and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. However the agreement does not include 12 Mission-owned Fox stations (and 13 other network affiliates) which were removed from DIRECTV on October 21 due to a separate carriage dispute.

The clog in the machine has been the YSRCP government that came to power three and a half years ago. Forget attracting newer players the state government has gradually forced out established companies and shelved projects that were about to be completed.

Sample this: A Singaporean consortium that would have developed a startup zone in the capital was evicted. Lulu Group from the UAE was sent out from Visakhapatnam. Adani was threatened. Franklin Templeton was shunted out. In Sri Satyasai district Kia suffered harassment. Jockey was made to leave and Reliance too was kicked out.

One can count on fingers the number of industries that have come to the state since the YSRCP came to power. Instead many have left. While all the neighbouring states are trying to attract industries and investments the Andhra government is pushing out industries for which land allocations and agreements have already been made in the past.

Several established companies are moving to the neighbouring states fearing for their business interests by the ruling party's representatives and the constant demands for concessions.

Lulu runs away to Tamil Nadu

During the previous government's tenure the Lulu company of UAE signed an agreement to build an international convention center and a mega shopping mall in Visakhapatnam with an investment of Rs 2200 crores to employ 7000 people. The government leased out 13.83 acres on Visakha beach road. The project's foundation stone was also laid.

However as the project was about to start the YSRCP government came to power and cancelled the land allocation. The issue was handled unprofessionally so much so that the company announced that it will not invest in any project given the situation in the state. On March 28 this year Lulu Group signed an MoU with the Tamil Nadu government to invest Rs 3500 crore.

Franklin Templeton expelled

Franklin Templeton one of the Fortune 500 companies took the initiative to set up a technology development campus in Visakhapatnam during the previous government's tenure. The company said that it will provide 2500 high-level IT jobs and invest 70 million dollars. The government had allocated 40 acres for the institution and announced incentives for the project. However soon after YSRCP came to power the company faced issues in kickstarting the project as the new government reallotted the same land to some other company. Even after 5 years since it was first initiated the project has not seen the light of day yet.

Jockey too moves out

The previous government had allotted 27 acres to Page Industries Limited (a Jockey apparel manufacturer) for setting up a factory at Raptadu near Anantapur. With an investment of Rs 129 crore the company planned to set up a factory and warehouse to manufacture 32.4 million garments annually. It was estimated that 6420 people would have been directly employed.

After YSRCP came to power a public representative of the party threatened the representatives of the company for donations. He warned that the subcontracts should go to his acquaintances and the jobs should be given as he said. As a result Jockey group approached the government seeking cancellation of the MoU it had signed with the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC).

Triton suffers a similar fate

In September 2018 American company Triton signed an agreement to set up solar battery manufacturing plants in Visakhapatnam and Chittoor with an investment of Rs 727 crore. It is a leading manufacturer of printable solar cells printed lighting and printed batteries. After YSRCP came to power the government showed little care for the project following which the company bid the state goodbye and shook hands with the Telangana government.

Reliance left after giving back the lands

During the previous government's regime the Reliance company came forward to set up an electronics manufacturing unit near Tirupati at a cost of Rs 15000 crores. The government had allocated 136 acres to the project. YSRCP handed over 75 acres to Reliance after coming to power. As many as 15 of those landowners filed cases in court for various reasons. As a result 50 acres of land fell into dispute.

As an alternative Reliance did not agree to APIIC's proposal to give land free of any disputes at Padiredu Forest of Vadamalapet Mandal. They returned the lands allotted to them to APIIC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9kZW1hbmQtZm9yLWNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5LW1pbmVycy1yaXNlcy1pbi1ydXNzaWEtYW1pZC1sb3ctcHJpY2VzLW9mLWhhcmR3YXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Demand for Cryptocurrency Miners Rises in Russia Amid Low Prices of Hardware – Mining Bitcoin News,,,,,,,

The course is relatively flat but heavy rain on the eve of Saturday morning’s race changed that goal.

Still Ponzio went fast for the conditions. He completed the muddy 5000-meter course in 16:00.90 and placed 15th in the Silver race which featured 303 runners. He earned a medal and backpack for his finish.

“It was muddy as hell” said Ponzio noting his backside from ankles to shoulders was covered in mud. “No one broke 15 minutes. But I’m happy with my result.”

Ponzio said that competing in the De La Salle Invitational earlier this season which featured a field of 255 runners helped prepare him for getting off to a good start in traffic.

“There was a lot of swerving at the start line” he said. “A lot of people don’t think about that in cross country but it was a good skillset to have. It came in handy.”

Ponzio said the race went out fast but conditions took a toll on runners later. Ponzio who has a strong athletic build realized he had plenty left in him for a good kick. He improved from 30th to 15th over the final mile.

Aptos senior Trent Nosky (16:14.80) took 35th.

Complex in-person offices brimming with constantly-ringing phones have been replaced BY global distributed “customer experience” teams.

Moreover new channels have emerged to help companies serve customers in an increasingly digital landscape and innovations are appearing at record speed to boost customer satisfaction levels.

Now heading into 2023 contact centers will entrench themselves further into innovation adapting to customers’ increasing demands while safeguarding employee experiences.

While it’s impossible to know what customer experience might look like a few years from now evaluating the latest statistics in the contact center space can give us an insight into where the landscape is heading.

Top Contact Center Statistics for 2023

In 2022 the term “transformation” remained at the forefront of the contact center vernacular executing advanced hybrid strategies without compromising on personalized convenient and meaningful customer experiences.

As a result more companies have adopted agile efficient and scalable cloud-based tools. Perhaps this is most evident in the growth of CCaaS a market hurtling toward a projected $19.8BN valuation by 2031.

Many trends are driving this growth some of which are evident in the statistics below influencing contact center decision-making.

Engagement Is Now Digital First: Since 2020 online interactions between companies and customers have accelerated. Around 57 percent of customers from all generations now prefer to engage companies through digital channels (Source: Salesforce )

Three-Quarters of Contact Centers Are Already In the Cloud: The cloud allows contact centers to be more business-oriented and strategic. However half of the respondents to a Calabrio survey say their current solution is limited and want to move to a more advanced service (Source: Calabrio )

The Cloud Enables New Employee Engagement Innovation: Around 60 percent of contact centers believe the cloud has increased employee engagement and satisfaction in their organization. Additionally 75 percent of companies that have migrated say they’re more likely to trust new and innovative tools like AI. (Source: Calabrio )

Replacing People With Bots Might Save Contact Centers $80 Billion: Gartner believes replacing people with AI chatbots could save the call center landscape up to $80 billion in staffing prices per year by 2026. By 2031 this number could increase to around $240 billion in savings each year. ( Source: Gartner

Interaction Analytics Gains Ground: Around two-thirds of respondents in one survey said they believe interaction analytics to be “very exciting” for the contact center. Other exciting tools included predictive routing (56.5 percent) customer prediction models (52.7 percent) and insight generation (52.4 percent). (Source: Call Center Helper )

The Evolution of Customer Experience

When investing in new technologies companies consistently say their main focus is boosting CX. As such many contact centers have enjoyed budget rises.

Much of this focuses on AI deployment. Indeed 51.8 percent of contact centers now have a contact center strategy built around AI according to Call Center Helper. Meanwhile 30.4 percent of participants are working on a new AI plan.

What is driving this? Primarily the goal of “increasing customer satisfaction” at 60.3 percent followed by contact reduction at 51.6 percent.

Yet new customer expectations are counteracting the positive influence of AI moving forward at an unrelenting pace.

Another fascinating statistic from Salesforce suggests that 78 percent of customers use more than one channel to start to complete a transaction.

Additionally 83 percent of these customers say they expect to interact with someone immediately regardless of how they contact the company.

Finally let’s consider a selection of stats that delve deeper into customer service experiences.

Virtual Agents Can Improve CX: IBM’s Business Value Institute found virtual assistant technology in the contact center led to 12 percent and nine percent improvements in customer and employee satisfaction scores. It also contributed to a 15 percent reduction in handling times and containment rates of around 64 percent. (Source: IBM )

The Importance of CX Ecplipses That of Products and Services: Around 88 percent of consumers agree that the contact center experience is just as important as the quality of the offering. Further 73 percent of customers say they expect companies to understand their unique expectations and needs. (Source: Salesforce )

Customer Conversation Complexity Has Increased Since the Onset of the Pandemic: The Harvard Business Review found the number of calls marked as “difficult” by contact center agents has increased by around 50 percent overall since 2021. Additionally there has been a 68 percent increase in issue escalations since agents have begun tackling more challenging problems. (Source: HBR )

73 Percent of Companies Are Making Customer Service More Personalized: Hyper-personalization initiatives will gain further momentum in 2023 with almost three-quarters of organizations boosting their personalization efforts in the last year. (Source: GetFeedback )

Customer Preferences for Self-Service Grow: Around 60 percent of UK customers say they prefer to solve issues themselves instead of calling a contact center. A further 72 percent said they want companies to provide more resources online which allows them to overcome problems autonomously. (Source: Macro 4 )

Customer Patience Is Dwindling: 66 percent of customers have become increasingly less patient with companies that are slow in adapting to shifting expectations. In line with this average response times increased by 24 percent from 2021 to 2022. (Source: Zendesk

Human Reassurance Is Still a Necessity: Despite a love of self-service 95.5% of customers still say they want the option to speak to a human agent when necessary. (Source: NTT )

We all know that Alex Ovechkin is on the verge of passing Gordie Howe for second-most goals all-time but as he’s going for Wayne Gretzky’s all-time record let’s look at some of the lesser records he could possibly get.

Home goals: Gretzky has 492 followed by Howe (449) Jaromir Jagr (411) Mike Gartner (401) and Ovi with 390. Even if Ovi breaks Gretzky’s goal record – 900 total would be a reasonable guess for the remainder of in contract – he will likely only have about 50 more goals at home so he might have to settle for second or third all-time.

Home power play goals: Already the all-time power play goal king Ovi still has three more players to pass to be the all-time home power play leader. With 147 Ovi is behind Teemu Selanne (148) Luc Robitaille (150) and Dave Andreychuk (151). Ovi had plenty of time to get this record.

Home game-winning goals: With 70 Ovi is currently second all-time in home game-winning goals to Jagr who has 72. The game-winning goal stat can be flukey but it’s very likely that Ovi will get this one.

Road overtime goals: Ovi has 11 tied with Sidney Crosby and only needs two to pass Jagr who has 12. Ovi is already the all-time leader with 25 overtime goals and the all-time leader at home with 14.

Road game-winning goals: Ovi with 54 is currently in third place behind Phil Esposito (60) and Jagr (63). While this record is within reach it’s not a slam-dunk since Ovi has nine of these in the past five seasons but needs ten to pass Jagr.

Multi-goal games: Ovi currently has 160 but the record is 189 by Gretzky. This one is likely out of reach.

Hat tricks: Just to put this one in perspective Ovi has 28 career hat tricks which ties him for 7th all-time. Gretzky has 50 so Ovi isn’t getting this record either.

Empty net goals: With 49 Ovi is second to Gretzky who has 56. At home Ovi has 18 good for 5th place while Gretzky has 26. Ovi is the all-time leader in empty net goals on the road. This record is possible but the Caps first need to start playing better in Ovi’s last few seasons.

Most 20-goal seasons: Ovi has 17 tied for 7th but Howe has 22. Ovi likely won’t get this unless he signs another contract.

Most 30-goal seasons: Ovi has 16 one behind Gartner who has 17. Ovi will likely get this record or tie it at the very least.

Most 40-goal seasons: Ovi and Gretzky are tied at 12.

Most 50-goal seasons: Ovi is tied with Gretzky and Mike Bossy at 9. Even if Ovi gets this record the fact that Bossy did this in only 10 seasons (compared to Ovi and Gretzky’s 17 seasons) is simply amazing.

Hits: I’m not sure I want Ovi to get this record but considering how high he is on the list it’s worth looking at. Ovi is currently fourth place all-time behind Matt Martin Dustin Brown and Cal Clutterbuck but not close to passing anyone and older than those ahead of him.

Shots on goal: There are several shot-on-goal records that Ovi is nearing: Overall and home but he’s already the all-time leader in road shots on goal by far 331 ahead of Ray Bourque. Overall he’s only 45 behind Bourque. At home he’s in third with 3039 behind Jagr (3054) and Bourque (3415).

Records by right-handed players: Gordie Howe was right-handed as is Ovi so any time Ovi breaks a Howe record he takes the right-handed crown as well. However Gretzky is left-handed.

Goal scored in wins: Ovi has scored 574 wins second in NHL history behind Wayne Gretzky (635). The Caps will have to improve mightily the next few seasons for Ovi to get this record. Total goaltenders scored against: Ovi has scored on 165 different goaltenders the third highest total by a player in NHL history behind Jagr (178) and Patrick Marleau (177). This record is possible. Game-opening goals: 135 goals by Ovechkin tied with Jaromir Jagr (135). Ovi should get this record easily.

Sorting through more data there are certainly far more records within reach for Ovi most of which will fly under the radar due to the criteria (most goals by a left wing on the road on a Tuesday for instance). That’s ok though as long as he passes Gretzky for most goals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0Z3VhbS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9saWZlc3R5bGUvbm9ib2R5LXdhbnRlZC10by1hZG9wdC10aGUtZG9nLXdpdGgtb25lLWVhci0tLXVudGlsLWhlLXN0YXJ0ZWQtcGFpbnRpbmcvYXJ0aWNsZV9iMWZmYjNmZS03MmFkLTExZWQtYjEwMS0xM2RkZDVlY2E5YjYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nobody wanted to adopt the dog with one ear - until he started painting,Nobody wanted to adopt the dog with one ear - until he started painting,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNqb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3BodXQwMzY5NzAz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Susan ""Sue"" J.

Documents disclosed by Bloomberg on Dec. 3 show that Genesis Digital raised $1.15 billion from Alameda in less than nine months.

The capital infusion was made before the crypto prices downturn between August 2021 and April of this year. Genesis Digital is the major United States-based Bitcoin mining company and it’s not related to Genesis Capital the trading company with $175 million worth of funds locked away in an FTX trading account.

Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried recently recognized participating in Alameda’s venture decisions including the investment in Genesis Digital despite initially denying it to regulators. Based on the documents the capital deployment was made by Alameda in four different moments: $100 million in August 2021 $550 million in January $250 million in February and $250 million in April 2022.

Last year Genesis Digital raised a total of $556 million through two separate funding rounds to fuel its aggressive growth plans. Some of the funds sought the purchase of 20000 Bitcoin miners from Canaan a new data center in Texas and the expansion of its United States and Northern European operations.

The mining sector has seen its margins of profit being squeezed by rising energy costs and the bear market. The latest Q3 mining report from Hashrate Index highlighted several factors that have led to a significantly lower hash price and higher cost to produce 1 Bitcoin (BTC). The revenue earned by Bitcoin miners fell to two-year lows of $11.67 million due to poor market performance and a heavier computational demand.

The recent FTX crisis is expected to make the crypto winter even longer as investors’ confidence eroded. A Coinbase report shows that stablecoin dominance reached a new high of 18% indicating that the liquidity crisis might extend at least until the end of 2023.

Genesis Digital Assets did not immediately respond to Cointelegraphs' requests for comments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2ItMjEtcmFpZGVyLXdvcmxkcy1maXJzdC02dGgtZ2VuLXdhcnBsYW5lLXVudmVpbGVkLWNhbi1wZW5ldHJhdGUv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vYi0yMS1yYWlkZXItd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LTZ0aC1nZW4td2FycGxhbmUtdW52ZWlsZWQtY2FuLXBlbmV0cmF0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,B-21 Raider: World’s First 6th-Gen Warplane Unveiled! Can Penetrate ‘Toughest Defenses Anywhere In the World’,"The B-21 ‘Raider’ demonstrates that the US stealth technology has genuinely taken a massive leap forward. Unveiled at Palmdale in California in the early morning on December 3 the B-21 Raider with its 9600 km range and roughly 10-ton payload is the only hope of being able to fight China and stay out of its missiles’ ranges.

The indication of the unparalleled American lead in stealth aviation is the frontal view of the plane – albeit it was the only angle revealed.

The thin air intakes are the single biggest indicator of the engine and materials technology employed in the plane. Having large intakes increases the chances of radar bouncing off the aircraft as it has more surface to reflect from.

The B-21 Raider has been known to be developed as a subsonic aircraft and not meant for the tight maneuvers of a fighter. Its unveiling and eventual deployment would be the first credible tool with the US against its massive range of logistical technological and doctrinal weaknesses before China in the Western Pacific.

The color scheme was white and did not have the peculiar stealth pattern of sharp edges and serrations seen on the B-2. Whether this was not the final paint scheme is not known.

But it can be safely assumed that Northrop has worked on moving from the expensive radar coating paint and materials whose wearing off often keeps a lot of B-2s in the hangar.

Why the US Needs the B-21 Against China

China’s thousands of DF-16 DF-17 DF-21 DF-21D and DF-26 missiles have every major US base in range and will be the first ones to be taken out in case of a full-scale war. With Kadena in Japan and Guam’ bombed out’ the US can only watch helplessly as China surrounds and seizes Taiwan.

If the US intervenes the Chinese can comfortably keep fighting from the home turf and keep shooting down any American naval and air assets while taking some acceptable and anticipated level of material and personnel losses.

If the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) missiles fail the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) and the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) have the numbers and technology to prevent US intervention while the rest of its military seizes Taiwan.

This therefore makes the B-21 strategic stealth bomber including the B-52s the B-1 Lancer and the B-2 Spirit its leading edge in the war in the western Pacific.

There have been calls to make around 150-200 planes and that stage is still a long way. Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden laid out the standard “robust ground testing and first flight” stages.

Possibly taking at least two years it will see massive tweaking and modifications to finalize the series production model.

But Northrop claims that too has been taken care of with the “digital twin” approach where an exact digital replica has been created to envision and study the impact of various technical tweaks. Combined with its “open architecture” design the upgrade process has been claimed to be faster and as effective.

The plane would cost $203 billion to develop operate and purchase 100 aircraft over 30 years according to estimates provided to Bloomberg by the US Air Force (USAF). The estimated per unit cost meanwhile remains under the $550 million target. To make a difference it all depends upon how fast Northrop churns out the series production and with what changes.

What Do We Know So Far?

Two days before Northrop Grumman unveiled the B-21 ‘Raider’ it revealed it to be a deep penetration intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance (ISR)-centric bombing and electronic attack platform.

Describing it as a sixth-generation aircraft the company has abandoned the ‘block’ approach for future upgrades. The “digital twin” and “digital engineering” industrial manufacturing processes bring their own cost-saving benefits.

The plane has been expected to break through and evade Chinese radars air defense systems and release its payload of missiles and bombs on sensitive ground targets before flying back.

Judged to be more advanced than China’s and Russia’s under-development H-20 and PAK-DA stealth bombers there is considerable consternation in Beijing and Russia over the Raider’s capabilities.

Generation 6 – An Undefined Concept?

In a statement reported by Air and Space Forces Magazine the company said that the Raider “has been designed as the lead component of a larger family of systems that will deliver intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance electronic attack and multi-domain networking capabilities.”

This means getting battlefield information and sending them to friendly forces is a primary role along with bombing and missiles with both possibly being performed simultaneously.

Therefore ISR and electronic warfare (EW) is a new role for a dedicated strategic stealth bomber possibly setting the stage for the definition and configuration of Generation 6 aircraft which has yet to be articulated.

Military aviation experts have long been divided over what Gen. 6 technologies and capabilities in combat aircraft might entail. Some leading analysts like Alexander Yermakov of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) dismissed the category as an “artificial” concept created by aviation historians and “marketing executives.”

More autonomy with a higher proportion of artificial intelligence (AI); engines that are an evolution of jet propulsion; sleeker bodies possibly without vertical stabilizers (tails) for greater stealth; even more powerful radars and; the ability to fire directed energy weapons (DEW). These are some of the features experts have reached a broad consensus on.

Given the evolution of US military aviation technology and the troubled state of its Gen. 5 fighters like the F-22 and F-35 it is unlikely the Raider will be a radical departure from Gen. 5 to Gen. 6. It may help coherently direct the development of Gen. 6 technologies possibly serving as an unintended technology demonstrator.

During its subsequent decades in service as it sees upgrades and possibly sees military operations against peer adversaries Russia and China aviation technologists air power theorists pilots and military planners will have a clearer idea of the next evolutionary stage.

It is pertinent to remember that the United States developed Gen. 5 stealth fighters in the 30-year unipolar era where it had no economic technological or military rivals.

The contribution of Russia and China – nearly caught up and capable of dealing a severe blow to the US military – to the debate on the future of combat aviation would be significant and cannot be ignored.

Northrop Grumman Reveals

Northrop says the B-21 will rely on “external support platforms or systems.” Whether these are escort aircraft bomber-launched vehicles satellites or other technology is unclear.

Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall recently announced shelving the plan to develop dedicated autonomous long-range collaborative combat aircraft (CCA or ‘wingmen’) for the B-21.

These were meant to escort the B-21 deep into enemy territory. But the bomber would still launch decoys jamming vehicles or ISR drones.

The plane has been designed in a modular open architecture framework for “rapid upgradeability” dumping the “block upgrades” approach. “The B-21 uses agile software development advanced manufacturing techniques and digital engineering tools to help mitigate production risk.” Whether this means 3D printing processes is unclear but cannot be ruled out.

The Raider “will provide the Air Force with long range high survivability and mission payload flexibility. The B-21 will penetrate the toughest defenses for precision strikes worldwide.”

Calling the B-21 the “backbone of the future for US airpower” Northrop Grumman said the B-21 has “advanced integration of data sensors and weapons” capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear payloads and “a broad mix of stand-off and direct attack munitions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL3R2L3VzdHYvYTQyMTQyNjYxL3RoZS1ib3lzLWdlbi12LWZpcnN0LXRyYWlsZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Boys spin-off Gen V releases first dramatic trailer,"The Boys college spin-off series Gen V has released its first dramatic trailer and it looks just as thrilling and gruesome as the original.

Enthusiastic parade-goers lined Whitewater’s Main Street Friday as some 26 parade entries of various shapes and sizes participated in the Generac-sponsored Lighted Holiday Parade.

The event was organized by Downtown Whitewater Inc. a volunteer-driven nonprofit organization formed to promote Whitewater’s history and traditions according to its website.

Attendees and participants were greeting with moderate temperatures and a warming station was made available outside of the Discover Whitewater office on Main Street complete with s’mores and hot cocoa.

Other activities Friday included an opportunity to meet “Santa and Mrs. Claus” both of whom were made available for picture-taking inside First Citizens State Bank. The couple also rode albeit in separate Whitewater EMS vehicles in the parade. Placing each member of the Christmas couple in a separate vehicle allowed for an individualized presence Mrs. Claus said.

A list of parade entries includes: Badgerland Offroad Whitewater Girl Scout Troop 7639 Fort Atkinson Credit Union Productive Living Systems Whitewater Grocery Company Ferradermis Generac Carting K-9s Walworth County Chapter of the Ice Age Trail Republican Party of Walworth County Hispanic Outreach Coalition CHC Christian Horse Lovers PremierBank University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Royal Purple News Lima 4-H City of Whitewater Parks and Recreation Department Visiting Angels Whitewater Scout Troop BaristaCats Cafe The Boat House of Whitewater Whitewater Charge Club Visiting Angels LAS Whitewater High School band Avant Cycle Cafe Johns Disposal Service and the Walworth County Fairest of the Fair.

A cookie-decorating and chili dinner event was held at the Living Word Fellowship Church also on Main Street after the parade.

Despite a massive effort at voter suppression by the United Auto Workers bureaucracy in the union’s presidential election socialist candidate Will Lehman received the votes of 4777 workers according to an unofficial final tally posted by a court-appointed monitor Friday evening.

Only 103495 votes were cast by the union’s 1.1 million active and retired members. The 9 percent turnout shows that the outcome of the election is illegitimate and any leadership which may emerge from it will not have a shred of credibility in the eyes of the membership as a whole.

Incumbent UAW President Ray Curry and longtime bureaucrat Shawn Fain each received under 40 percent of the vote winning less than 40000 votes though Curry won several hundred more than Fain. The two main candidates of the bureaucracy failed to win the support of 4 percent of the total membership. According to the rules the two top vote getters proceed to a run-off if no candidate wins over 50 percent of the vote. No run-off can be legitimate if the two candidates failed to receive close to a combined 10 percent of the vote in the first round.

It is evident that the vast majority of UAW members were unaware that an election was taking place or did not even receive a ballot. The UAW apparatus and its entrenched leadership which had opposed direct elections in a referendum last year took only the most minimal efforts to inform workers about them hoping to suppress turnout as much as possible and confine the process to their favored candidates.

“This election was a travesty” Lehman told the WSWS.

“Appoximately nine out of 10 UAW members who are eligible to cast a ballot did not vote. That’s not because they don’t care it’s because they didn’t know an election was happening. While there was voter suppression across the board it is now clear that the UAW conspired to prevent almost the entire UAW academic worker membership on the West Coast from voting at all even though 48000 UAW members are engaged in a courageous strike against the University of California system. There is no innocent explanation for this. This vindicates my campaign’s decision to sue the UAW and the Monitor two weeks ago to extend the deadline and notify the membership. The judge’s decision denying my request has been proven totally illegitimate.”

Indeed some UAW locals with thousands of members saw turnout of 1 percent or less while numerous other locals saw turnout of less than 10 percent.

According to the UAW Monitor UAW Local 4123 with over 11000 members at the California State University System returned just 29 ballots—a turnout of just 0.26 percent. Lehman won 24 percent of the votes in this local.

UAW Local 4121 with approximately 9000 members at the University of Washington submitted just 74 ballots a turnout of 0.8 percent. Lehman won 23 percent of the votes cast in this local.

UAW Local 5810 was sent 6000 ballots to post-docs and academic researchers at the University of California system where workers are currently on strike. The local reportedly returned just 328 ballots a turnout of 5.5 percent. Lehman won 13 percent of votes cast in this local.

UAW Local 2865—also on strike—was sent 30138 ballots but only 921 votes were cast. Lehman won 15 percent of this vote. There is no explanation for why only 36000 ballots were sent to the 48000 striking UC workers.

The number of ballots tallied by the Monitor fell by nearly 30 percent by approximately 40000 votes compared to the national referendum last year in which workers voted to implement direct elections. Roughly 143000 members voted in the referendum.

Despite the UAW bureaucracy’s efforts to suppress the vote Lehman won significant support at a broad swath of workplaces including auto factories parts warehouses heavy and military equipment manufacturers and universities. Lehman a second-tier worker at Mack Trucks ran on an explicitly socialist and internationalist platform calling for the abolition of the corrupt pro-corporate UAW apparatus and the transfer of power to rank-and-file workers.

At Local 677 at Lehman’s Mack Trucks plant in Pennsylvania he received 151 votes 18.6 percent of the total.

Local 2069 the Volvo Trucks New River Valley plant in Virginia: 67 votes or 11.1 percent

Local 600 Ford Dearborn Truck: 111 votes 2.9 percent

Local 249 Ford Kansas City Assembly: 103 or 5.7 percent

Local 140 Stellantis Warren Truck: 85 votes or 8.4 percent.

Local 1268 Stellantis Belvidere Assembly in Illinois: 77 votes or 6.9 percent

Lehman also won important support from relatively smaller plants where workers have been engaged in struggle over the past year. At Locals 180 and 807 covering striking CNH workers in Racine Wisconsin and Burlington Iowa Lehman received 16 and 15 votes respectively approximately 11 percent of the votes cast at each. At auto parts maker Ventra in Evart Michigan—where workers rejected a UAW-endorsed concessions contract by 95 percent earlier this summer—Lehman received 11 votes or 14 percent of those counted.

As the WSWS previously reported Lehman attracted support from workers at military equipment makers. At the General Dynamics plant in Lima Ohio which manufactures the M1A1 tank for the US military Lehman received 8.2 percent of the vote. At AK Steel in Butler Pennsylvania which makes military helicopters Lehman received 12.4 percent and at the GE Aviation plant outside of Cincinnati Ohio he received 8.8 percent.

Among UAW members at the universities Lehman also received considerable support. At the New School in New York City—where Lehman recently visited the picket lines of striking adjunct faculty—he received 63 votes or 14.4 percent of those cast at a local which also covers part-time faculty at New York University. At University of Massachusetts Amherst he received 23 votes (13.5 percent) as well as 23 votes at Harvard (7.6 percent).

It is apparent that the rank and file in many locals learned that an election was taking place not from union officials but from emails and plant-gate leafleting conducted by Lehman’s campaign. The UAW bureaucracy’s efforts to keep workers uninformed coincided with a virtual blackout in the national press as well as those publications presenting themselves as “left” such as Jacobin magazine.

In recent weeks Lehman filed a lawsuit in US District Court requesting that the UAW voting deadlines be extended by 30 days and that real measures be taken to inform all workers that the elections were taking place. The suit included dozens of statements from rank-and-file workers that they had not received a ballot despite requesting one multiple times from the Monitor.

The UAW bureaucracy and the UAW Monitor as well as the Biden administration’s Department of Labor all opposed the suit arguing that Lehman did not have “standing” to pursue the case. The federal judge sided with the UAW and the Monitor and dismissed the suit despite acknowledging that Lehman had raised serious concerns about the manner in which the UAW was conducting the election.

The low turnout reflects both the efforts by the apparatus to suppress the vote and the deep alienation of rank-and-file workers from the bureaucracy which has imposed brutal attacks on wages and benefits on behalf of the corporations over the past 40 years.

The immense hostility of workers to the UAW apparatus found expression in the fact that the two candidates most heavily promoted as favorites by the media Curry and Fain both long-time members of the bureaucracy received only approximately 39000 votes each a combined total of roughly 8 percent of the total membership eligible to vote.

The vote by several thousand workers across the US for Lehman on the other hand explodes all the reactionary myths that the American working class is irredeemably hostile to socialism. At workplaces from Detroit to rural Iowa and Virginia to Kentucky Tennessee and Ohio workers voted for an avowed socialist and internationalist supporting his call to end the dictatorship of the bureaucracy and place power in the hands of workers on the shop floor.

The campaign by Lehman has taken place amid—and consciously articulated—a growing rebellion in the working class. Facing skyrocketing living costs and unbearable working conditions more and more workers around the world are being radicalized and looking for a way to fight back. This is seen in the US in the ongoing strikes by tens of thousands of academic workers and the courageous struggle by more than 100000 rail workers against the combined forces of the corporations and the capitalist state.

At a growing number of plants and workplaces workers have begun to form rank-and-file committees including the GM Flint Assembly Plant Ford Chicago Assembly Stellantis Detroit Assembly – Mack in the rail industry and most recently at the University of California. This burgeoning movement for the rights and interests of the working class must now be carried forward and vastly expanded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS9ob3dhcmQtbW9vcmUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzgyODk1NDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Howard Moore Obituary (1950 - 2022) - Fort Worth TX - Star-Telegram,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dfw/name/howard-moore-obituary?id=38289541 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS9ob3dhcmQtbW9vcmUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzgyODk1NDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMDMvaXMtZi0xNi1yZXRpcmVtZW50LWNvbWluZy1pbi0yMDI1LXdhc250LXRoZS1mLTE2eGwtYmV0dGVyLWNob2ljZS_SAWpodHRwczovL2J1bGdhcmlhbm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzAzL2lzLWYtMTYtcmV0aXJlbWVudC1jb21pbmctaW4tMjAyNS13YXNudC10aGUtZi0xNnhsLWJldHRlci1jaG9pY2Uv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is F-16 retirement coming in 2025?

In short: The UV laser excites indole(H 2 O) from the electronic ground state S 0 (1) to the electronically excited ππ* state (2). The system then interconverts to the optically dark πσ* state which is accompanied by nuclear and electronic rearrangements into (3). Subsequently interconversion takes place to the vibrationally hot S 0 state (4). This vibrationally-hot electronic-ground-state indole(H 2 O) dissociates into separate vibrationally-excited indole and H 2 O molecules (5) most likely via so-called statistical unimolecular decay. Moreover vibronic-wavepacket dynamics occur in this system which were taken into account in the reaction model. In the following the different steps will be discussed in more detail.

Fig. 3: Schematic of the UV-induced photochemistry in indole(H 2 O). a The purple arrow indicates the UV pump-photon energy yielding the overall energy in the system after absorption of an UV photon indicated by the purple line which is conserved throughout the dynamics. The shaded purple area represents the corresponding bandwidth. Blue horizontal arrows depict the different steps in the observed photochemistry with corresponding timescales; see text for details. The red arrows indicate the absorption of NIR probe photons leading to ionisation. The black dashed lines labelled D eff represent the cationic states that need to be accessed to efficiently ionise from a particular initial state in indole(H 2 O); see text for details. The green arrows represent the dissociative ionisation process leading to the formation of indole+ and H 2 O. Dashed arrows indicate a significantly lower probability for a specific process to take place. The indole + H 2 O product channel contains a lot of vibrational energy. Note that the energies in this figure are not to scale.

Full size image

When the UV laser (purple arrow in Fig. 3a) excites indole(H 2 O) to the ππ* state the system can be ionised by the subsequent absorption of three NIR photons (left red arrows) through the electronic ground state D 0 of the cation which has a similar geometry as the ππ* state45 and an ionisation energy of E i =7.37 eV46. The vertical transition is indicated by the dashed horizontal line labelled D eff in Fig. 3a. This results in the fast initial increase in the indole(H 2 O)+ signal. Due to the excess energy above the ionisation potential fragmentation of indole(H 2 O)+ can occur44 leading to a small contribution to the fast increase in the indole+ signal see Supplementary Note 4.

The subsequent interconversion from the ππ* state to the πσ* state with τ 2 = 445 ± 71 fs is accompanied by nuclear rearrangement and electron transfer as shown by the results of ab initio calculations that are described in Methods. In the equilibrium geometry of the πσ* state depicted in Fig. 3c the H 2 O molecule tilts along the in-plane-bending coordinate of the cluster and the N-O distance decreases whilst the N-H distance increases with respect to the geometry in the S 0 state depicted in Fig. 3b. Moreover an electron is transferred from a π-orbital on the indole moiety to a σ*-orbital localised around the H 2 O molecule. This is depicted by the calculated isosurfaces of the orbital amplitudes plotted in the structures in Fig. 3b c.

In order to efficiently ionise the system from this geometrically different πσ* state with a different amount of vibrational energy (3) i.e. in a vertical transition it seems that a higher-energy cationic state needs to be accessed depicted by the dashed horizontal line labelled D eff in Fig. 3a. We suspect that this cationic state is above the binding energy of indole(H 2 O)+ of 0.6 eV47 resulting in more fragmentation of the cation and correspondingly more indole+ signal47. This process likely required four NIR photons see Supplementary Note 4 for more details. Overall this leads to a decrease in the indole(H 2 O)+ signal and a corresponding increase in the indole+ signal. This agrees with the fast increase in the indole+ signal being delayed with respect to the fast increase in the indole(H 2 O)+ signal.

We attribute the 1.67 ps oscillations overlayed on these electronic and nuclear dynamics to wavepacket dynamics for instance due to indole ring breathing modes or C–H-stretch vibrations which modified the transition strengths in the system see Supplementary Note 5. We expect that these dynamics occurred due to the coherent excitation of vibrational states with an energy difference of 20 cm−1 within the bandwidth of the pump laser depicted by the shaded purple area in Fig. 3a and that they manifest themselves as a modification of the vertical-ionisation probability which lead to the observation of these oscillations.

Subsequently the indole(H 2 O) complexes in the πσ* state interconvert within τ 3 = 13 ± 2 ps to the S 0 state through nonadiabatic coupling as was described before48. We expect that this interconversion leads to vibrationally-excited indole(H 2 O) clusters in the electronic ground state which were ionised less likely due to the increased E i for a vertical transition—depicted by the dashed horizontal line D eff state in Fig. 3a – and which results in indole(H 2 O)+ ions that subsequently dissociate leading to indole+ signal. This would explain the slow decrease in the indole(H 2 O)+ signal and the slow increase in the indole+ signal.

We believe that the vibrationally-hot indole(H 2 O) subsequently dissociates on a timescale of τ 4 = 96 ± 10 ps into separate neutral indole and H 2 O molecules containing significant vibrational energy. Both products could be ionised which explains the increasing indole+ and H 2 O+ signals. At least four NIR photons are needed to reach the ionisation energy for the vibrationally-hot indole whereas a minimum of 14 NIR photons is needed for the ionisation of ground-state H 2 O.

An alternative pathway for the formation of H 2 O molecules would be direct dissociation in the πσ* state. However our measured TKER distributions Fig. 2 match Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions for delays >65 ps which strongly indicates that the H 2 O molecules are formed in a statistical unimolecular-decay process in the S 0 state instead of a direct dissociation process in the πσ* state see Methods. Direct dissociation from the ππ* state is in principle possible but also because of the short sub-picosecond lifetime of this state irrelevant.

The mean of the TKER distributions changes as a function of the delay see Fig. 2. This time evolution is explained by considering the ion-dipole interaction: When the H 2 O molecule is ionised and the separate indole and H 2 O+ molecules are still relatively close they will repel each other due to the repulsion of the H 2 O+ charge and the indole dipole leading to an increase in the kinetic energy. For longer delays the increased distance between the two moieties results in a correspondingly lower kinetic energy. The width of the TKER distribution is governed by the wavepacket evolution along the ion-dipole interaction potential and decreases for longer delays. We used a classical ion-dipole interaction model to describe the evolution of the TKER; details are provided in Methods. This yielded the dashed blue line in Fig. 2 which is in very good agreement with our experimental results indicating that the two moieties on average slowly move apart with a speed v ≈ 12 m/s. This is another confirmation for the statistical unimolecular-decay process in the S 0 state.

In order to shed light on the possible net hydrogen-transfer process taking place in the πσ* state of indole(H 2 O)29 we investigated the H 3 O+ signal. However we did not find any delay-dependent effect in the H 3 O+ signal coming from neutral dissociation of indole(H 2 O). This indicates that although the N–H bond is stretched in the πσ* state the electron transfer is not followed by proton transfer to H 2 O for dissociation. We conclude that after UV excitation at 4.61 eV the indole(H 2 O) aggregate either survives or dissociates into the individual indole and H 2 O molecules which themselves stay intact and slowly move away from each other.

Our pump-probe experiments on pure indole(H 2 O) samples in combination with our reaction model based on a five-level system provide new insight into the ultrafast processes occurring in this prototypical solvated-biomolecule system especially regarding the combined electronic and nuclear dissociation dynamics and its product channels. The time constant τ 2 = 445 ± 71 fs that we assigned to the interconversion from the ππ* to the πσ* state and accompanied nuclear rearrangement and electron transfer is within the broad range τ 2 = 150. . . 500 fs previously tentatively attributed to dynamics on the πσ* surface39. We note that τ 2 in the present study is on the same order as the instrument response function (IRF). We could not resolve the fastest time constant of ~ 50 fs31 or 20. . .100 fs39 observed before since it is shorter than the IRF. This time constant was previously assigned to internal conversion from the ππ* to the πσ* state31 or from the 1L a to the 1L b state39 which are both ππ* states. Regarding the time constant τ 3 = 13 ± 2 ps our interpretation is consistent with previous tentative assignments of a 14 ps decay constant to interconversion from the πσ* state to the S 0 state31. While previous work was not able to distinguish products from different cluster sizes our well-defined-reactant study fully supports this finding. Furthermore the τ 4 = 96 ± 10 ps time constant we obtained for the bond breaking and formation of H 2 O is comparable to the ones found for the production of (NH 3 ) n−1 NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) resulting from dissociation of indole(NH 3 ) n clusters with n ≤ 243.

In conclusion we demonstrated that our experimental approach using species-selected samples to perform pump-probe studies of ultrafast chemical dynamics provides unprecedented details on intermediates and reaction products and thus the chemical reaction dynamics. Creating a high-purity sample of the prototypical solvated biomolecule indole(H 2 O) enabled us to investigate its UV-induced dissociation dynamics in intimate detail well beyond previous experimental studies. We observed an initial delay in the appearance of indole+ ions which we ascribed to the ionisation of indole(H 2 O) from the ππ* and πσ* states resulting in different cationic states of indole(H 2 O) with distinct fragmentation probabilities. Moreover we could follow the long-time relaxation dynamics in the reaction products which revealed clear evidence for an incomplete hydrogen-transfer process and thus indicates that the indole chromophore is protected by the attached water against UV-induced radiation damage. This is opposite to earlier theoretical predictions29 but fully in line with previous experiments31.

While in previous experiments the H 2 O+ product signal was completely obscured by the unavoidable large amount of H 2 O in the molecular beam our purified samples allowed us for the first time to experimentally determine the time constant of the hydrogen-bond-breaking process to τ 4 = 96 ± 10 ps. Moreover based on the kinetic-energy distributions of the H 2 O products we conclude that this biochemically important process49 occurs via statistical unimolecular decay in the electronic ground state. As ultrafast excited-electronic-state deactivation after the absorption of UV photons could be essential for the photostability of proteins50 our results demonstrate how such mitigation of UV-induced radiation damage through solvent interactions works.

Overall these results demonstrate that our experimental approach combining the deflector velocity-map imaging and pump-probe ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy enables the observation of complete chemical-reactivity pathways in chemical reactions of complex molecular systems. The investigation of a bimolecular half-collision reaction allowed for the precise triggering of the dynamics and presents a promising approach for more complex chemical systems.

Our approach can directly be combined with shorter i.e. few-femtosecond or attosecond laser pulses and with tunable wavelengths to follow the energy-dependent ultrafast electronic and chemical processes in complex reaction systems. This could be further aided by coincidence measurements1651. On the other hand high-energy UV photons could be used in order to ionise the complex and its fragments with a single photon. Moreover diffractive imaging of the nuclear dynamics42425 would provide complementary detailed information on the actual atomic structural dynamics. For instance photoelectron-momentum-imaging and laser-induced-electron-diffraction experiments would be a direct extension of the current experiments and initial experiments are ongoing5253. These approaches should reveal the complete reaction pathway of the nuclear and electronic dynamics that occur in these reactions.

The developments follow an email sent by Twitter on Thursday to advertising agencies offering advertisers incentives to increase their spending on the platform an effort to jump-start its business after Elon Musk's takeover prompted many companies to pull back.

Twitter billed the offer as the ""biggest advertiser incentive ever on Twitter"" according to the email reviewed by Reuters. U.S. advertisers who book $500000 in incremental spending will qualify to have their spending matched with a ""100% value add"" up to a $1 million cap the email said.

On Saturday a Platformer News reporter tweeted that Amazon is planning to resume advertising on Twitter at about $100 million a year pending some security tweaks to the company's ads platform.

However a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Amazon had never stopped advertising on Twitter.

Separately during a Twitter Spaces conversation Musk announced that Apple is the largest advertiser on Twitter and has ""fully resumed"" advertising on the platform according to a Bloomberg report.

Musk's first month as Twitter's owner has included a slashing of staff including employees who work on content moderation and incidents of spammers impersonating major public companies which has spooked the advertising industry.

Many companies from General Mills Inc to luxury automaker Audi of America stopped or paused advertising on Twitter since the acquisition and Musk said in November that the company had seen a ""massive"" drop in revenue.

Apple and Twitter did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment on the matter.

General Motors has rolled out a new simulator that allows people who have dreamed about what it's like driving on the surface of the Moon to experience exactly that. For many the Apollo missions launched a unique excitement about what space has to offer humanity. In total humans have reached the Moon six times and 12 different people have set foot on its surface (via History).

With a renewed interest in reaching the Moon there has been much buzz in the air about what this new set of missions might look like. The Artemis I has now lifted off and plans for future lunar exploration are very much back in focus and on track. NASA reports that in the next few years a person of color and a woman will be among those putting human footprints on the Moon once again.

PopSci reports that when the Artemis missions eventually place humans on the Moon much of the transportation will be done with autonomous driving technology.

Online shopping accelerated greatly during Covid-19 lockdowns; and it has irreversibly changed the habits of consumers who are devouring new payment methods like never before. This ravenous appetite for new payment experiences requires that banks be agile enough to offer or facilitate innovations such as payments-as-a-service (PaaS) embedded finance digital wallets buy now/pay later cryptocurrencies and emerging central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Moreover this trend doesn’t stop at the consumer or retail level. Corporate supply chains are likewise seeing a rush of innovative next-generation payment methods. In combination with nontraditional competitors a race toward real-time and exponential technologies—including advanced analytics machine learning hybrid cloud extreme automation and intelligent workflows—this is driving changes to banking business models.

To give an idea of the scale of payment options available Bank of America recently expanded its CashPro Payment API (application programming interface) to allow customers to access more than 350 payment types in 38 markets globally. The explosion of different cashless payment types and the arrival of so many new nontraditional participants—both fintech and “techfin” (e.g. Google Amazon and Apple)—have upped the disintermediation stakes but also created opportunities for innovation and cooperation.

“Nobody is doing anything 100% on their own right now” explains Carl Slabicki co-head of Global Payments BNY Mellon Treasury Services. As more payment options emerge he predicts “it will become a bit of a fragmented mess and the banks that will succeed are the ones that can really stitch it all together.” The trick will be to manage all that complexity yet still deliver a safe and secure payment experience.

“Banks are realizing that payments are foundational” insists Mike Kresse division executive B2B (business-to-business) and money movement at FIS “which is why they need to be resilient robust and able to be upgraded without the need for major heart surgery.”

With change being the only certainty a cloud-based infrastructure provides financial institutions the agility required to meet customer expectations regulations and any technological shifts that might come along in the future without requiring rebuilds of core architecture.

“There has been a huge acceleration of cloud-based digital payments over the past 10 years and I think it will increase over the next five years” states Rachel Hunt vice president of strategy and growth at Volante Technologies—a global provider of cloud payments and financial messaging. “While everyone talks about low cost and delivery in the cloud the key thing for me is innovation.” In addition to customer demands she notes there is a rapidly changing landscape. “We must incorporate new standards adapt to new regulations and think about new ways to pay” she says.

The fact that it’s expensive takes too long [and] liquidity is … is a real call to arms.” — Dave Sissens RTGS.global

Evolving from monolithic to flexible hybrid-cloud architectures can according to Shanker Ramamurthy global managing partner Banking and Financial Markets at IBM Consulting help banks unlock business value and the benefit of new technologies.

Messaging Modernization





Although cloud services can mitigate much of the friction caused by the proliferation of payment networks a lack of interoperability between networks and countries is still a roadblock. “When it comes to interlinking existing payment systems a lot of work is being done to align different rule sets and regulatory environments—and the size of this task should not be underestimated” says Isabel Schmidt co-head of Global Payments BNY Mellon. “But it is not just about changes to the payment rails themselves. We must also consider how to effectively manage and optimize liquidity. As more payment systems develop it is going to be more important to have a centralized view of your liquidity so that you can efficiently respond to payment requirements.”

Swift’s upcoming general rollout of the global standard for payments messaging ISO 20022 will create a common language for payments data across the globe. “With ISO 20022 you can validate upfront that you have all the information. You need to pass that payment all the way straight through which creates a better client experience; and you can process the payment-risk management processes within the bank” BNY Mellon’s Schmidt adds.

Standardization via ISO 20022 is fortunately inevitable says Andy Schmidt vice president and global industry lead for banking at IT services company CGI: “The reality is that ISO 20022 is a common payment language; and if we are going to do cross-border real-time payments we have to speak a common language.”

Swift has agreed to delay ISO 20022 migration until March 2023 to ease implementation; but for many meeting the mandate will be a first step. “Everyone needs to go through a [ISO 20022] maturity model” says Hunt. “First you need to be able to accept and send the ISO 20022 messages; however ISO 20022 touches every single system in the bank so you critically need to create an ISO canonical—and start benefiting from the value of ISO 20022 which is the enriched data—and that’s a strategic direction.”

Volante provides a range of ISO 20022 native offerings to help financial institutions meet the deadlines without changing legacy systems. “Neobanks have no tech legacy” explains Hunt. “For a bank who has grown organically over the past hundred years migration is going to be harder.”

Greater harmonization and enriched structured payments data will enable transaction banks to share strategic knowledge with customers; and while Slabicki says the low-hanging fruit is in leveraging data for risk and fraud detection it could also allow banks to provide value-added insights to corporate clients based on specific payment and velocity trends. “It becomes a question of the customer—not our customer but our customer’s customer—and building suitable use cases” suggests Kresse. “A lot of our existing clients don’t have an operational data store where they can go in and index and search through specific types of payments as it’s very hard to get from multiple systems. But the types of analytics that we’re making available come from a single payments area where they can drive analytics on specific customer segments and payment histories.”

Taking on the Competition

Embedded finance and platform banking are major growth areas where banks can provide their customers with a richer and broader set of capabilities. IBM’s Ramamurthy singles out DBS Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) for broadening the ecosystem. “They are not waiting for a customer to come to them” he says. “They are extending the banking value chain further upstream or downstream depending on how you think about it to make the bank the destination site.” DBS created marketplaces to sell cars holidays and properties—enabling the bank to offer adjacent services beyond mortgages for example including insurance and renovation loans. “By providing those kinds of capabilities by the time you get to wanting a mortgage the bank becomes a natural place where the mortgage originates from.”

He notes that regulators open banking APIs and standardization efforts are all helping to level the playing field by taking away some of financial institutions’ natural advantages. “It’s a combination of these reasons forcing banks to rethink their models and adopt an ecosystem platform-based approach” says Ramamurthy. “It’s not about just automating existing processes it’s about rethinking them end to end and digital transformation. Because paving the cow path is going to get you only so far—it’s just going to make your complex processes more automated.”

As banks create value along an ecosystem some of it sticks to the bank. A mobile app from SBI called YONO which stands for “you only need one” is a mobile app for tens of millions of customers that offers more than banking. “The SBI is able to provide its customers with better value when they for example book hotels or make e-commerce purchases in Flipkart or Amazon. The customer can get superior value from the e-commerce end merchant by going through YONO” he explains. “The only requirement is you must use an SBI product when transacting in the other e-commerce websites. It’s really taking the fight to the competition and effectively commoditizing it by taking some of the profit margin from the e-commerce websites and passing it on to their customers and taking a slice in terms of deeper customer relationships.”

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has made India the largest real-time payments (RTP) market in number of transactions (48.6 billion in 2021) and the Reserve Bank of India released its Payments Vision 2025 in June 2022 to future-proof payments on the subcontinent. “Vision 2025 is going to take India to the next level of payment transactions” states Rajashekara V. Maiya vice president and global head of business consulting at Infosys Finacle. “With UPI transactions today we process almost 6 billion transactions per month—now we are looking at around a minimum 50% [compound annual growth rate] every year.”

Unsurprisingly India’s success at promoting RTP is being copied by its neighbors and beyond. “This is now being adopted in many more countries surrounding Asia and we know that it’s going to be replicated elsewhere” Maiya says. “Australia is now looking at how to implement RTP and there are conversations happening in Canada.”

Nonetheless each hurdle surmounted leads to a new one. “The next one we’ve got to solve is cross-border instantaneous payments” suggests Philip Panaino global head of Cash at Standard Chartered. “That’s the next holy grail after many countries have developed domestic instantaneous fast payment schemes. But perfecting instant payments cross-border between parties where you have to convert currencies at speed where someone’s asleep and someone is awake is complex and exciting.”

One potential solution for cross-border RTP is using blockchain with either CBDCs or other digital assets. Baton Systems is a fintech specializing in post-trade processing using distributed ledger technology (DLT) and CEO Arjun Jayaram insists cross-border payments are nothing but a foreign exchange transaction plus two local transactions. “Money is not just currencies it’s currencies and securities and anything that’s of value.” Baton has built a platform that allows any bank or other financial institution to essentially have a node of the network that connects to bank accounts and all the places where a firm has its assets and it’s able to move those assets between parties. “It’s a DLT base but it is not tokenizing money—it’s not moving real assets to the real world—so you actually have access to your currencies and your securities at the end of it” Jayaram says adding “This process normally takes 24 to 48 hours. We are able to settle within three minutes on a payment process.”

Dave Sissens CEO of RTGS.global a global network that offers real-time liquidity and settlement for commercial banks financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and central banks says the underlying liquidity movements in wholesale banking are still running on legacy rails. “It can often take days to get large values from one country to another. Cross-border transactions go through multiple hands and money moves in one direction whilst messages move in another—so it’s pretty broken.”

He says the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments is a real boost to dealing with that friction: “The fact that it’s expensive takes too long liquidity is opaque and people enter into transactions in the hope that they’ll get to the other side is a real call to arms to change the way cross-border settlement works.” RTGS.global is a new FMI: a global payment system that lets clients move wholesale money in one currency to another supported by central bank money. “It’s a 24-hour liquidity ‘fabric’ backed by real money—not crypto not stablecoins—which can be moved instantly” he says.

It’s not just fintechs that are looking to find DLT-based payment solutions. Card companies facing disintermediation from digital payment models have made several strategic moves over the last several years to tokenize accounts. When Visa launched B2B Connect in 2019—to make high-value corporate payments using DLT to underpin its network—it soon realized there was a $120 trillion B2B payments opportunity. “When you talk to corporates about cross-border payments they talk about the lack of visibility a lack of transparency and a lack of predictability when the funds will be arriving” states Ben Ellis senior vice president and global head of Visa B2B Connect. “It felt like there’s a better way and that’s what we were looking to do with B2B connect as a multilateral network.”

Statista predicts digital payments will reach $8.49 trillion in 2022 with a 12.31% annual growth rate through 2027—resulting in a total of $15.17 trillion by then. With such a large payments pie on the table both banks and newcomers are finding innovative ways to carve out a share while satisfying the demands of customers who are now used to buying whatever they want whenever they want in any way they choose.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9uLWNvbW1lcmNlLzIwMjIvd2luYy1zaW5rcy1pbnRvLWJhbmtydXB0Y3ktYXMtdGFzdGUtZm9yLXdpbmUtc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ucy1zb3Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winc Sinks Into Bankruptcy as Taste for Wine Subscriptions Sours,"You might have thought that an online wine club would be impervious to consumers’ belt-tightening.

News came last week that Winc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company had gone public a bit more than a year ago.

Last November the company’s initial public offering (IPO) raised $22 million with shares at $13 right out of the gate. At this writing upon filing with the court for bankruptcy shares were trading for about 20 cents.

The bankruptcy filing itself runs a few hundred pages and shows $50.3 million of assets and $36.4 million of liabilities with Meta listed as a top creditor with a trade line of more than $724000.

Bloomberg reported that the company is seeking a buyer for its assets.

Now it must be noted that Chapter 11 is no liquidation – rather the firm can keep operating as it restructures or finds a buyer or pays its creditors. But the company’s latest quarterly report shows the pressures in place. Wholesale case volume was up over 7% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year period “primarily due to a one-time sale of select inventory below cost” as the company continued to expand its retail footprint. The company took note of a challenging macro environment and we note that the fact that after Meta one of the top creditors is FedEx owed about $568000 — which indicates the operating costs of a direct-to-consumer model that needs to get the goods to the consumers’ doorsteps.

Indeed looking through the company’s 10-Q we see that loss from operations year to date (into the September quarter) stood at $12 million widening from $10 million a year ago while revenues declined to $51.9 million from $53.6 million last year.

We might call Winc one of the latest casualties of the connected economy where the data-driven model offered (and yes since it’s Chapter 11 still offers) personalized recommendations based on questionnaires and home delivery.

But now the great reopening is fully in force and there’s at least some return to the wine shops and the in-person tasting and the liquor stores in general. Back in September we found that alcoholic beverage subscriptions were relatively resilient. But now there’s a wholesale pivot to cutting back on all manner of nonessential expenses and the average retail subscription is down 40% from peaks seen last year. Thirty-four percent of consumers canceled subscriptions due to a desire to reduce expenses. And as we found too 43% percent of existing retail subscribers are uncertain about renewing their plans.

The fruit of the vine may lift one’s spirits — but it didn’t lift Winc investors’ fortunes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9pdGFseXMtbWVsb25pLW1heS13YXRlci1kb3duLWNhc2gtcGF5bWVudHMtcGxhbi1hZnRlci1ldS10YWxrcy0yMDIyLTEyLTA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Italy's Meloni may water down cash payments plan after EU talks,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italys-meloni-may-water-down-cash-payments-plan-after-eu-talks-2022-12-04/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9pdGFseXMtbWVsb25pLW1heS13YXRlci1kb3duLWNhc2gtcGF5bWVudHMtcGxhbi1hZnRlci1ldS10YWxrcy0yMDIyLTEyLTA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpc3VhbGNhcGl0YWxpc3QuY29tL21hcHBlZC1nbG9iYWwtZW5lcmd5LXByaWNlcy1ieS1jb3VudHJ5LWluLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mapped: Global Energy Prices by Country in 2022,"Mapped: Global Energy Prices by Country in 2022

For some countries energy prices hit historic levels in 2022.

Gasoline electricity and natural gas prices skyrocketed as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ruptured global energy supply chains. Households and businesses are facing higher energy bills amid extreme price volatility. Uncertainty surrounding the war looms large and winter heating costs are projected to soar.

Given the global consequences of the energy crisis the above infographic shows the price of energy for households by country with data from GlobalPetrolPrices.com.

At an average $11.10 per gallon households in Hong Kong pay the highest for gasoline in the world—more than double the global average. Both high gas taxes and steep land costs are primary factors behind high gas prices.

Like Hong Kong the Central African Republic has high gas costs at $8.60 per gallon. As a net importer of gasoline the country has faced increased price pressures since the war in Ukraine.

Households in Iceland Norway and Denmark face the highest gasoline costs in Europe. Overall Europe has seen inflation hit 10% in September driven by the energy crisis.

2. Global Energy Prices: Electricity

Extreme volatility is also being seen in electricity prices.

The majority of the highest household electricity prices are in Europe where Denmark Germany and Belgium’s prices are about double that of France and Greece. For perspective electricity prices in many countries in Europe are more than twice or three times the global average of $0.14 per kilowatt-hour.

Over the first quarter of 2022 household electricity prices in the European Union jumped 32% compared to the year before.

In the U.S. consumer electricity prices have increased nearly 16% annually compared to September last year the highest increase in over four decades fueling higher inflation.

However households are more sheltered from the impact of Russian supply disruptions due to the U.S. being a net exporter of energy.

3. Global Energy Prices: Natural Gas

Eight of the 10 highest natural gas prices globally fall in Europe with the Netherlands at the top. Overall European natural gas prices have spiked sixfold in a year since the invasion of Ukraine.

The good news is that the fall season has been relatively warm which has helped European natural gas demand drop 22% in October compared to last year. This helps reduce the risk of gas shortages transpiring later in the winter.

Outside of Europe Brazil has the fourth highest natural gas prices globally despite producing about half of supply domestically. High costs of cooking gas have been especially challenging for low-income families which became a key political issue in the run-up to the presidential election in October.

Meanwhile Singapore has the highest natural gas prices in Asia as the majority is imported via tankers or pipelines leaving the country vulnerable to price shocks.

Increasing Competition

By December all seaborne crude oil shipments from Russia to Europe will come to a halt likely pushing up gasoline prices into the winter and 2023.

Concerningly analysis from the EIA shows that European natural gas storage capacities could sink to 20% by February if Russia completely shuts off its supply and demand is not reduced.

As Europe seeks out alternatives to Russian energy higher demand could increase global competition for fuel sources driving up prices for energy in the coming months ahead.

Still there is some room for optimism: the World Bank projects energy prices will decline 11% in 2023 after the 60% rise seen after the war in Ukraine in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9jYXJlZXJzL2N1c3RvbWVyLXNlcnZpY2UvMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9ob3ctbXVjaC1kb2VzLWRvb3JkYXNoLXBheS84MDYzNjU3MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How much does DoorDash pay?

In the fourth quarter of the business year DoorDash and Uber Eats both made impressive progress. DoorDash recorded all-time high order numbers and Uber Eats turned a profit for the first time according to Protocol — but which one company is better to work for?

Whether you’re a self-starter looking for ways to supplement your income or a customer wondering about your delivery worker’s wages here’s the information you’re after.

How much does DoorDash pay?

Dashers make a base pay between $2 and $10 per delivery depending on factors such as duration distance and desirability of the order according to DoorDash. The company claims its drivers make approximately $25 per hour of work including 100% of tips from customers.

Ridester reports drivers can expect to make between $10 and $25 per hour. Ridester emphasizes though that DoorDash drivers are responsible for their own vehicle expenses such as gas and maintenance so Dashers do not pocket all of their earnings and tips.

The company also offers promotions which allow drivers to earn more money including Peak Pay Guaranteed Earnings and Challenge Bonuses.

How do DoorDash drivers get paid?

Dashers can choose to receive their pay a number of ways according to the company. Options include a weekly direct deposit at no charge a Fast Pay option which charges a $1.99 fee per daily withdrawal and a DasherDirect prepaid debit card which provides instant deposits with no fee after every delivery.

According to DoorDash drivers can also opt into receiving cash on delivery orders.

How much does Uber Eats pay?

Uber Eats drivers as of the summer of 2022 make an average of $9.37 per trip and $15.84 per hour according to Gridwise. Like many rideshare drivers Uber Eats drivers are also responsible for their own vehicle expenses.

How much to tip for DoorDash and Uber Eats

DoorDash and Uber Eats workers should always be tipped. The standard in the restaurant industry is 15 to 20% according to Shopfood. But Ridester says a minimum tip amount between $4 and $6 should be the norm on all orders; even a very cheap delivery may require the same driving or biking distance as a more expensive meal.

If your delivery driver has to endure inclement weather that should also boost their tip. Ridester suggests rideshare drivers working in adverse weather conditions should be rewarded for their willingness to work when others are staying inside.

As a giant American flag unfurled spanning the entire outfield at Globe Life Field the Texas Rangers and Colorado Rockies lined the bases placing their caps over their hearts as the Opening Day crowd rose to its feet for the National Anthem. Globe Life’s marvel of a roof was open to view blue skies overhead. This was the scene as the Rangers kicked off their 50th season in Arlington — the team’s third at the new $1.2 billion Globe Life Field (the second there with fans in the stands).

Rangers players will wear a special patch on their uniforms to commemorate the 50th anniversary throughout this season. But it’s not about what’s old as much as what’s new at what’s still Major League Baseball’s newest ballpark.

You may have heard about some of the new wild concession offerings including the alligator corn dogs and the brisket-filled egg rolls. But what may be even more important for certain game goers is the introduction of 12 new Mothers’ Rooms meant to make game day a walk in the park for moms.

This season Globe Life Field is partnering with Hello Bello the family care brand co-founded by wife and husband actors Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard. The company manufactures and distributes more than 100 different family products including diapers wipes toiletries and even cleaning supplies.

“Parenting can feel like an endless pickle between third base and home so these clean and relaxing spaces will give parents a chance to breathe while having access to complimentary Hello Bello essentials including diapers wipes hand sanitizer and hand soap” a release notes.

Each of the eight fan-accessible rooms is themed after Hello Bello’s vibrant and creatively named diaper designs including Alphabet Soup Watery Melons Wildcats and Sleepy Sloths. Four additional rooms have been designated to serve the players’ families and those who work in the team’s executive offices.

Meaningful Mothers’ Room

These new Mothers’ Room provide seating in relaxed privacy for calm feedings away from the roar of the crowd as well as sanitary changing stations and an assortment of Hello Bello diapers. Plus convenient hand washing stations.

The partnership comes along with Hello Bello’s larger investment in Texas. The company opened a diaper factory in Waco last October. That 312000 square-foot facility made major headlines. It was brought to life by Waco design mega stars Chip and Joanna Gaines’ Magnolia design team which assisted in the general design staging and visual merchandising of the space.

Hello Bello is unique for another reason as well. It’s the only independent diaper company in the United States to manufacture its own products from design to delivery. Who knew?

Globe Life Field has also installed two special self-sanitizing Pluie changing stations in the high traffic fan-accessible Mothers’ Rooms that are located by Sections 209 and 104. Founded by two mothers Pluie touts itself as the world’s first and only self-sanitizing diaper changing table for public restrooms powered by a patented UV-C light system adding even more peace of mind.

After deGrom sent shockwaves through the baseball world on Friday by signing a five-year $185 million contract with the Rangers the hard work starts now for the Mets as they look to rebuild their rotation and rebound after losing a franchise cornerstone. And according to Heyman they are just one of many teams in on Taillon.

Interestingly Heyman notes that the Rangers are also interested in Taillon despite just committing multiple years and major bucks to deGrom with the market for Taillon thought to be huge. Heyman also states that the righty is in line to receive an “extremely good deal” in this current market.

Taillon who was the second overall pick in the 2010 MLB Draft had a solid campaign in 2022 with the Yankees posting a 3.91 ERA in 32 starts across 177 1/3 innings. He struckout 151 and walked just 32 establishing himself as a key piece in a Yankees rotation that was dominant for large parts of the 2022 season.

The 31-year-old has struggled with injuries throughout his career but he boasts a career 3.84 ERA in 143 career starts. Taillon is projected to land a three-year deal worth around $44 million in free agency per Spotrac.com and he should be a solid middle-of-the-rotation pitcher for a legit contender.

Heyman also notes that the Baltimore Orioles are focussed on pitching this winter and are in on free agent starter Carlos Rodón who the Mets have spoken with as they look to reshape their rotation heading into 2023. With deGrom now in Texas and Chris Bassitt and Taijuan Walker also both free agents that leaves just Max Scherzer and Carlos Carrasco as the only certainties in the rotation for the 2023 season.

Finally with the Winter Meetings set to get underway on Sunday Hot Stove season is starting to heat up and Heyman reports that the Yankees have kicked the tires on free agent outfielder Brandon Nimmo. It doesn’t appear clear at first if the leadoff hitter would be a fit in pinstripes unless Aaron Judge signs elsewhere in free agency while the Mets Blue Jays Giants and the Rays remain in on the 29-year-old. It remains to be seen whether or not Nimmo will join deGrom in signing elsewhere this winter or will indeed return to Queens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzA0L2xpZmVzdHlsZS9teS1neW0tY3J1c2gtaXMtaGF1bnRpbmctbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My gym crush is haunting me,"Q. I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for more than four years. I started going to the gym by myself because my boyfriend used to work a lot.

Over a year I developed a huge crush on one guy at the gym — and I believe he had a crush on me. But we never talked or even said hello to each other. I kept guessing his name but never had the guts to approach him. I always blushed when he was around and he had a shy smile. Then I had to leave that gym for six months because of my work.

Recently I joined again but this time with my boyfriend. I thought I would never see my gym crush again but suddenly he was there — and he saw my boyfriend and I working out together. My gym crush looked sad and I don’t know why it’s bothering me. I love my boyfriend and he is perfect. I should be focusing on that right? I don’t want to lose him but when I left the gym I kept thinking about my gym crush.

If my gym crush had a crush on me he would try to find me on social media right? I don’t like feeling this guilt. When I see my crush I feel like I am losing feelings for my boyfriend.

Is it normal to have these feelings sometime? Or is this completely wrong? Please help. Thank you.

WORKING IT OUT

A. It’s OK to have crushes on people. It happens even if you’re in a wonderful exclusive relationship with a partner.

It’s pretty easy to develop crushes on fictional people and to some extent that’s what your gym crush is. You don’t know if he’s kind mean extroverted or shy. You don’t even know his name. You like the way he looks (and his facial expressions) but everything else about him is an invention. He’s perfect because you can make him anything you want. It’s not a real connection until you get to know him.

Also I would guess that his facial expressions correspond to yours. If you saw him after a long time and seemed surprised or upset he might have been mirroring that. Maybe what you saw him show was ... confusion.

My question for you: Does your crush on this man suggest that you might want to be single? Do you wish you were in a place where flirting and connecting on social media could be OK? If you want to be on your own seeing what else is out there that’s not about the gym crush. He’s just a catalyst.

Maybe this crush is upsetting you because you don’t know how to categorize it. Think about what he symbolizes and make decisions accordingly.

READERS RESPOND:

So to recap: You don’t know this guy’s name. He doesn’t know yours. You’ve never spoken to him. You think your boyfriend is perfect yet you think this guy should be searching for you on social media and you’re constantly thinking of him? ... You should break up with your boyfriend.

Having crushes is not a big deal. But you do need to figure out why you have created this fantasy world where a man you see in the gym but have never spoken with possesses feelings that exactly mirror your own.

“... he would try to find me on social media right?” How about focus on people who actually speak to you!

42GIANTS





Having a long-lasting crush on a complete stranger whose name you don’t even know who you didn’t find on social media (why should it just be him?) means you are not quite satisfied with your relationship with your boyfriend. I would examine that. Maybe he’s perfect but you are not quite ready to settle down (also no one is perfect so if you think that examine that thought as well).

Anchored at 533 Main Street the two-phase development is referred to simply as The Crossings and will comprise around 200000 square feet of retail and commercial space 820 mixed-income apartments public outdoor space a parking garage for 1200 vehicles and additional surface-level parking spaces.

The developers leading the project include Triangle Equities and Incline Capital along with primary investment partners Goldman Sachs and Basis Investment Group. According to the team The Crossings is scheduled to commence construction this November with completion anticipated by the end of 2024. When complete the complex will be the largest-ever development to debut in East Orange.

“Since acquiring the first site in the assemblage our vision for this project has been to create a development that will not only provide quality fresh foods restaurants retail amenities and mixed-income housing to the City of Easts Orange but also create a transformative economic and community development project” said Triangle Equities director of capital markets Josh Weingarten. “Upon completion The Crossings will provide a new focal point for the City of East Orange and catalyze additional investment and economic growth in the City by ensuring that social equity goals are interwoven with the development plan.”

The complex financial package includes funding from nearly a dozen public and private supporters.

Completion of the retail component and necessary infrastructure to support the sprawling development will be financed with a $17 million loan from the Reinvestment Fund in partnership with the Low-Income Investment Fund and BlueHub Capital $15 million of New Markets Tax Credit equity invested by PNC Bank $10.5 million of financing from the NJ Infrastructure Bank and $1.65 million Series 2022A Redevelopment Area Bond. An additional $24.6 million in direct equity will be provided by the Urban Investment Group within Goldman Sachs Asset Management Basis Investment Group Triangle Equities and Incline Capital.

To date more than 85 percent of available retail space is pre-leased including a new ShopRite supermarket that will anchor the complex.

Funding for the residential portion of the project will largely be provided by PNC Bank. This includes a $63.8 million construction a $24.35 million bridge loan a $14.6 million LIHTC bridge loan and $17.6 million of LIHTC invested equity all provided by the institution. Support from the City of East Orange includes a $2 million loan and $24.35 million in Redevelopment Area Bonds.

Goldman Sachs Basis Investment Group Triangle Equities and Incline Capital have committed $46 million in direct equity for the residential component. The latter also benefits from $20 million in Low Income Tax Credits awarded by the NJ Housing & Finance Agency. Fannie Mae through PNC as DUS Lender committed to provide $88.2 million of mortgage-backed securities at the end of the construction through lease-up.

The project also received $52 million in New Markets Tax Credit allocation from eight community development enterprises including PNC Bank DV Community Investment Urban Action Community Development Enterprise Community Partners New Jersey Community Capital Local Initiatives Support Corporation Mid-City Community CDE and the Reinvestment Fund one of the largest new markets tax credit closings in the program history.

“The Crossings at Brick Church Station is a terrific example of the progress that can be achieved when public and private resources come together to strengthen the economic vitality of our communities” said Enrico Della Corna PNC regional president of New Jersey. “PNC as a national main street bank is committed to delivering our expertise and capabilities—from real estate finance to public finance to tax credit solutions—that help advance economic equality and enable all to move forward financially.”

However this confluence of events offers only one inflection point for understanding the history of African American mobility enclosure and residential segregation in the city of Hartford in the 20th century.

African Americans’ northward drift in the capital city began a full century before the Bellevue Square project. This chronology suggests a far more complex picture of residential segregation and the need to consider the longer arc of African American mobility and housing struggles alongside more familiar histories of redlining and residential segregation in the 20th century.

The deep legacies of slavery and its visions of policing and containing free people of color in certain areas inform an understanding of how both de facto and de jure segregation chiseled residential segregation into American urban communities like Hartford. Nineteenth-century practices of de facto discrimination also played a role in predisposing African Americans to housing insecurity and calcifying deep pockets of generational precarity.

Commonplace too in the 19th century were everyday forms of discrimination in addition to more organized forms of racialized terror. For example members of the Talcott Street Congregational Church Hartford’s first African American church chafing at social norms that justified discrimination in sacred spaces created their own religious society. Their contributions to the antislavery cause led to race riots and attacks on local African American homes in 1835 according to The Hartford Courant’s June 15 coverage. African Americans turned to familial and communal resources to confront these challenges as Barbara Beeching has shown in Hopes and Expectations: The Origins of the Black Middle Class in Hartford (SUNY Press 2017). Yet long into the 20th century ingrained patterns of racial exclusion and overt and covert threats of violence continued to shape visions of their erasure and containment in certain areas.

The yellow line shows the three locations of the Metropolitan A.M.E Zion Church and the blue line shows the three locations of Faith Congregational Church. The churches followed as shown by the green line the northward drift of the African American population in Hartford beginning in the mid-19th century. By 1940 the population had settled in what would become Bellevue Square before expanding west across Keney Park. Hartford Bound hartfordbound.com

The shifting boundaries of the city of Hartford delimited the spatial logics of these visions and practices. Hartford’s early African American neighborhoods developed in three clearly identifiable clusters in the city. In the older residential sections near the Connecticut River an initial cluster grew between the 1830s and 1860s. Many residences could be found on Front Commerce and Ferry streets prime thoroughfares for the riverine traffic. Close to place of work riverine and rail proximity were considered advantages long before the attendant environmental hazards and vulnerability to flooding were fully understood.

A second cluster with its center near the Mill (or Park) River—a tributary of the Connecticut River—also developed between the 1830s and 1860s. It stretched from downtown into the southern reaches of the city. Here people lived on streets like Cooper Lane and Bliss and Sheldon streets. A part of this community was displaced by the building of Bushnell Park during this period. A third cluster grew at Cemetery Lane (now Mather Street) in the proximity of Spring Grove Cemetery the only cluster remaining after the 1960s. The siting of two of Hartford’s earliest African American churches the Talcott Street Congregational Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in the clusters near downtown was a sign of how African American communities built their social and religious institutions in proximity to their residential locus.

The location of some of these neighborhood clusters duplicated vulnerabilities found in other American cities. Across the United States in the 19th century African Americans lived close to flood-prone poorly drained swampy or sloped areas near municipal wastes environmental nuisances and cemeteries. Whether their communities formed a block blocks or streets certain areas would become known as the Black part of town. Even when not explicitly set off as a “negro quarter” or a “Black bottom” African American enclaves like these became more discernible as race and space became more intertwined.

Despite the poor quality and limited supply of housing Hartford’s promise of prosperity was a beacon for African Americans near and far. The community that migrants joined hovered under 1800 people in 1910 a number that reflected a particular contradiction. While many people came still many others left creating patterns of anemic growth and transience.

Some who sought opportunities in Hartford including Catherine Murray from Fairfax Virginia had experienced enough of plantation life to set their sights elsewhere. Murray and 49 others from the same region of Virginia left for the usual New York gateway before trying secondary destinations. In doing so Murray was participating in a long tradition of mobility and migration that had brought African Americans to other shores. Her “elsewhere” was Hartford according to a profile by an unnamed Hartford Courant reporter on November 19 1914. Despite a life of economic precarity Murray remained a lifelong resident of Hartford raising her daughter and her granddaughter in the city.

Other African American migrants tried their luck alongside the native-born population. As city directories document they worked as shoemakers bootblacks laundresses porters waiters laborers cooks janitors and barbers. Some of the lucky ones had more singular business endeavors. Peter Lane for example went into pharmacy followed by his sister-in-law Anna Louise James of the famed Petry family.

Augustus Washington the successful daguerreotypist like Lane spent part of his life in New Jersey before coming to Hartford to open a studio in 1846. Renowned pianist and Kentucky native Raymond Lawson relocated to Hartford after graduating from Fisk University according to a profile of Hartford’s African Americans that appeared in the May 1902 edition of The Colored American Magazine “Hartford CT: Sketches of Some of Her Prominent Citizens.” Grant Williams the author of this profile was also one of these highly mobile people willing to plant his freedom dreams in as many places as possible.

Grant Williams described himself as “a general agent for high class Negro Literature” in an ad he placed in Geer’s Hartford City Directory in 1895. He made his sojourn to Hartford in the 1890s. Alongside the barber shop he operated out of 209 Pearl Street in downtown Hartford Williams was a correspondent for prominent African American publications such as the New York Age and the Philadelphia Tribune (where he would later become city editor). He lived above his barbershop before finding alternate accommodations. Williams also set his sights on gaining political and social prominence in both local and national African American affairs.

Labor shortages during World War I and direct recruitment for work in Connecticut’s boutique shade tobacco industry quickened the pace of African American migration and movement into the North End. From a low of 1745 in 1910 the city’s African American population grew to 4567 in 1920 and had reached 7090 by 1940. By this time African American orientation to downtown had become more pronounced as was the experience of serial displacement. Flooding and 19th-century iterations of urban renewal for the Bushnell Park and Gold Street redevelopment project displaced members of a community already facing limited housing supplies.

Hartford city planners developed plans for removing African Americans or when this could not be accomplished containing them. Writing in 1948 as part of a series of six articles that appeared in The Hartford Courant Reverend Robert Moody of Shiloh Baptist Church explored the challenges Africans Americans faced in Northern cities like Hartford in the era of the Great Migration. African American migrants had he declared in the third installment published on September 21 “substituted for the shacks of their former land the slums of our cities whether they were the sardined unsanitary tenements of Harlem or the rat-infested enclosure of our own city.” In the fifth article appearing on September 23 Moody described a home purchased at night to avoid white backlash. Still the homebuyer he reported had stones thrown in his window and faced fear mongering about his “11 children” when he in fact only had one child who was away at college.

The North End became then a contemporary bellwether for residential and racial segregation because the mobility of African Americans was treated as a form of contagion a rot to be prevented or contained. The 19th century had generated segregation that was meaningful at the level of streets and sometimes just a few blocks. Pockets of this kind remain in Hartford. Twentieth-century strategies around containment converged in housing and transportation policies. Racially restrictive covenants urban renewal public housing and the building of the interstate highway system collectively reshaped where African Americans could live in Hartford and other American cities pushing African Americans further into the North End.

In the last five years renewed attention to the legal and physical infrastructure of residential segregation has raised public consciousness about how and why America’s cities including Hartford became and remain deeply segregated. Scholarship on the subject spans academic and popular writing old and new media platforms and a range of interactive projects that take advantage of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

New scholarship revisits the origins of institutions like the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and later the Veterans Administration (VA) which helped to shape an infrastructure of mortgage access underwriting and homebuilding that accommodated discriminatory practices. It documents how real estate agents lied about the availability of units for rent or sale and steered clients into or away from particular neighborhoods. Agents stoked fears of racial invasion or contagion with the explicit support of industry publications like the Annals of Real Estate Practice published by the National Association of Real Estate Boards.

Developers accommodated racial preferences in their blueprints sometimes as a condition of their financing and insurance arrangements. Banks sometimes denied credit and mortgages while insurance companies coded maps to delimit where people could purchase homes and how their homes would be valued. Public housing experiments like Bellevue Square initially welcomed as a way to address the shortfalls in housing supply charted a middle ground by zoning units according to race and income.

Each American city produced its own vernacular forms of racial and residential segregation. What remained consistent however was the cast of characters and institutions that carved out the policies procedures and visions that informed where people could live. The collusion was systemic encompassing the federal state and municipal governments courts banks developers employers real estate agents potential neighbors and housing authorities.

Where people live can appear to be demographic accidents and individual choices that bear little relation to public policy or history. What the recent scholarship demonstrates therefore are the explicit and systemic connections between zoning land use policies urban planning and residential segregation. Long after the passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968 sought to eliminate these practices the introduction of new mechanisms for the expansion of homeownership opportunities created new vulnerabilities as underscored in Katherine O’Regan’s 2018 review of the 50th anniversary of this key legislation in Housing Policy Debate.

New mortgage underwriting and insurance terms incorporated communities of color on predatory terms according to Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor. Moreover the association between race property values and neighborhood character persisted as a shorthand way to maintain or justify racial segregation in every aspect of the housing market.

The prominence of the new scholarship serves as a form of a historical recognition if not a reckoning. This accounting matters just as much for cities like Chicago or Los Angeles which originated particularly vile housing policies as for the cities that followed suit in domesticating these practices. The suite of digital mapping projects like Mapping Inequality and the Urban Transition Project invite the public not only to explore its maps but also to download and make use of the underlying data that support the sites’ narratives.

My new digital humanities project in collaboration with James Kolb Hartford Bound (hartfordbound.com) makes a similar gesture with the goal of leveraging public and digital humanities methodologies to explore residential and racial segregation here. The project shows how Hartford’s built environment became a primer on the intertwining of race and space in both the 19th and 20th centuries. From the design of the interstate system that cut off the commercial business district from the African American community and its Home Owners Loan Corporation maps to the location of public housing projects and railroads the website maps how Hartford bears the imprint of 20th-century residential segregation. The site also maps how the AME Zion and Talcott Street (now Faith Congregational) churches relocated from downtown to the North End mirroring the movement of the African American population. In mapping African American mobility the site shows that the Bellevue Square project’s location in the immediate vicinity of the historic Cemetery Lane cluster was no mere coincidence. Hartford’s 20th–century history of segregation its 19th-century antecedents and its contemporary iterations help to explain how the North End of Hartford became a predominantly African American community.

Under sunny skies but with temperatures of only about 40 degrees and a brisk breeze mittens were the perfect accessory for many of the 1600-plus participants in the Hartford Marathon Foundation’s annual Blue Back Mitten Run held Sunday morning in West Hartford.

This year’s race swag was a pair of bright green and blue fleece-lined mittens which many runners and walkers eagerly donned before the race began. The mittens were a perfect complement to the already-festive outfits that many participants wore. Santas elves and other holiday-related characters as well as runners in “ugly” sweaters took to the streets of West Hartford for the 5K run as well as a half-mile and mile kids race.

Santa greeted runners with high-fives at the finish line in Blue Back Square and holiday cookies awaited as a post-race treat.

Chris Angelo 27 of West Hartford broke the tape in 15:32 just 11 seconds shy of the Mitten Run record of 15:21 set by Tommy O’Gorman last year on a slightly different course. Angelo who had won the 5K Mitten Run race in 2018 and 2019 was 20 seconds faster this year than he was in 2021.

Mario Vazquez 44 of Farmington finished second in 15:57 followed by Max Aronow 25 a West Hartford native who now lives in Bloomfield finishing third in 16:33.

Among the women Katie Overstrum 24 of Wallingford was first in 19:02 the 17th runner overall to finish the race. She was the third-place finisher last year. Linda Spooner 48 of Sturbridge MA was the second female finisher in 19:12 and Shannon Quirk 26 of West Hartford was third in 20:16.

West Hartford Mayor Shari Cantor who intended to run the race at a leisurely pace was second in her age group finishing in 25:11.

Several hundred children ages 2-11 participated in the HMF FitKids race and were given the opportunity to run distances of ½ mile or one mile. Some particularly the youngest were also accompanied by their parents during the event.

The Mitten Run also supported West Hartford’s Town That Cares Fund and bins full of new mittens gloves scarves and hats were collected as donations for needy residents.

Enjoy!







































Apparently the first wave of voyagers from the Transformers Legacy Evolution line have been found in Hong King but we await confirmation. We do have in hand images of them though (no boxes shown) that were posted on the HobbyMiser Facebook page . They show off Tarn's excellent articulation through a myriad of poses.Enjoy!

These pictures made me realize that the new Leo Prime toy may be missing a piece of detail found only on the original toy mold and on the MP but on no other preexisting Lio Convoy toy mold: His backside rocket boosters. Posted by Sabrblade on December 4th 2022 @ 8:39pm CST

If im not mistaken he has ""rocket boosters"" or little nubs with blast effect compatibility. Either that or the guns can go back there.

I was on the fence about Tarn but these are good shots. He seems simple yet fun much like Jhiaxus. I wonder if he'll be just as hollow. Regardless I have him on preorder. Posted by Rodimus Prime on December 4th 2022 @ 10:34pm CST

I REALLY hope this is real. I passed on the crankcase remold it's not a super great color scheme but bits so obscure and if it does well maybe it will signal for more RB characters. Posted by Flashwave on December 4th 2022 @ 11:01pm CST

Many have said it but I would do anything for a CHUG Rescue Bot. Would love a WFC retool of Mirage into a Morbot. THIS is exactly what Legacy should be.

Because it's the closest thing to the CW figure from BotCon.









Emerje It's weird that the medic figure has more guns than the figure it's made from that's literally called a Triggercon. I wonder if those guns are actually his? It would make more sense for him to come with the same blue axe as Skids and Burn Out like the original figure than orange versions of Elita 1's guns. I suppose their gang molded with Minerva's lightbar but they could have just as easily used the ER Prowl lightbar that we've seen used on its own several times. I mean I'll take extra weapons as long as it doesn't effect the price.Because it's the closest thing to the CW figure from BotCon.Emerje Posted by Emerje on December 5th 2022 @ 1:23am CST

Just so long as the Prime Force drones are sold separately. Otherwise getting all of that in a leader class for Energon Optimus would be more than a little disappointing. It would be better selling them separately than it would be to sell the whole thing as a commander too so as to not waste the spot on something that could easily be sold separately. Not that everyone would enjoy that either.



I really hope Big ConvoyStampy Magmatron and Galvatron are being considered. Just a few of the ones I want most from BW II and Neo.



For Morbot though I use Netflix Decepticon Mirage for that. It's far from perfect but I didn't really know what else to do with Decepticon Mirage and the colors reminded me of MOrbot a bit. A while back I repainted a PotP Jazz as Quickshadow based on her ""Rescan"" toy. I never even watched Rescue Bots either and I want Generations versions of them.

You make a good point about the Drones being sold separately. Could be a Deluxe class with 4 Core Limbs sort of like the original plans for the upcoming Volcanicus. Posted by Stormshot_Prime on December 5th 2022 @ 1:46am CST

I saw this on TFW yesterday so many off the wall comments and it felt like mine were just completely ignored...Oh well anyway... It was interesting to see that some fans liked the idea many others were like ""Why RB in Generations? I never watched that preschool show...""



Oddly enough while there were Medix toys in the RB toyline the character himself never appeared on the show. I did watch all of RB because it was age appropriate for my kids at the time. I never watched RB Academy (outside of a couple of clips on Youtube). It appears a Medix character actually appeared on RBA (the nephew of Ratchet) but if its supposed to be the same character who knows. The Legacy pics bear a striking resemblance to the Botcon 2016 customization class figure more than anything else:







I'm so glad I own this as all of the variations of this Ratchet Custom build class toy; Medix is arguably the hardest to create/obtain especially pushing on 6+ years since the convention. At any rate if Legacy is supposed to represent all TF Fiction why not Rescue Bots as well?





ZeroWolf wrote: Interesting a possible exclusive for the likes of Velocitron?



Possibly or Selects or Buzzworthy. Being a Medic lots of fans including myself assumed it might be the Walgreens exclusive for 2023. I really hope not though. Usually those aren't revealed until a few months into the new year and I'm really hoping 2022 Minerva is the last year of Walgreens exclusives seeing as they make it a real pain to obtain and show little concern for exclusives since their toy rep left.

Rescue Bots was age-appropriate for my son when it came out. At Comic-Con he asked multiple Hasbro designers like Evan Brooks about seeing Rescue Bots in a Generations-style. I showed him this Legacy design and he's so excited.



But realizing because of the medical tie-in this might be a Walgreens exclusive hurts my soul. lol.

I had a list during Prime Wars --



Heatwave via CW Hot Spot

Blades via CW Alpha Bravo

Chase via CW Dead End

Boulder via CW Rook

Morbot via CW Dragstrip

Salvage via CW Hot Spot or CW Long Haul

Blurr via Breakdown

Quickshadow via Breakdown

Servo via TR Ravage



Makes me wonder if any recent figures have had Rescue Bots characters as alternate head sculpts. Rescue Bots was age-appropriate for my son when it came out.

I love the idea of the Legacy line living upto the title. Not just modernising older figures but producing unreleased ones. Especially those so close to the finished product as Marauder.

I could imagine more Generations Rescuebots not being far off. Maybe as part of an Amazon subline



Heatwave from Legacy Bulkhead

Chase from Earthrise Runamuck

Boulder from Kingdom Warpath (HEAVY retool)



Blades is a bit of a pickle. His helicopter mode isn't similar to any that we've gotten recently. Maybe they'll release an updated Cybertron Universe Evac soon and call a recolor of that close enough. Posted by Dr. Caelus on December 5th 2022 @ 4:06pm CST

I got Dead End Inferno Starscream and Transmetal 2 Megatron today and all four are great. Starscream is much better than the Thrilling 30 version Dead End looks nice next to the other Stunticons and I'm happy to have Inferno and Megatron seeing as I never had the originals when I was little.

He won't need to if these are out in Hong Kong he can just get it from Hasbro Asia like In Demand Toys does normally (this was why they were Shipping TF Selects Abominus before Takara themselves.) Its also why first sightings come from Singapore or the surrounding regions.

Legacy Wave 3 really did not need to go this hard on the Wave 3 beasts but they did and we have 2 positively spectacular figures. Inferno is trying really hard to unseat Jhiaxus as my favorite voyager and Megatron is trying really hard to unseat Metroplex and Jhiaxus as my favorite figure of the line.

I definitely think Inferno is superior to Jhiaxus. And that's not a slight against Jhiaxus but high praise for Inferno. For me best voyager so far since either ER Optimus or Megatron or maybe Kingdom Blaster. And yes I know Optimus was sold as a leader but the base figure is a voyager.

Both stores looks like they got at least 2 cases each of the Deluxe Beast Assortment from earlier this year. I guess we know what they will be clearing out in January . Went to 2 different Walmarts today. I am now all but convinced that because of Velocitron & the Legacy Beast Assortment they opted not to order any Legacy Deluxe Wave 2.Both stores looks like they got at least 2 cases each of the Deluxe Beast Assortment from earlier this year.

I don't believe stores choose which WAVE to order as much as they say ""hey distro we're running low on product X"" so the distribution center sends them more product x which may be wave 1 because they over-ordered it and it hasn't moved as much or wave 2 is buried under residual wave 1 (first in first out after all) or distro never got wave 2 in themselves because they never needed more inventory after the initial push. Now the legacy beasts and velocitron are almost certainly a factor in the lack of need to order more because they take of space both on the shelf and in storage but it's not ""we have enough wave 1 so we don't need wave 2"" as much as ""we have enough transformers we don't need more.""

TlDr; No regrets paying full price. He's worth it. I transformed Legacy Dragon Megatron without instructions and he was pretty fun to figure out. The bot is bad-ass with a clever use of the dragon claws that become the ribcage. As a dragon he does have a very different shape than the bot but he's still pretty much upright. So I consider him to have two bot modes rater than a bot and beast mode. He's also quite imposing and feels solid in hand like T-Rex Megatron.TlDr; No regrets paying full price. He's worth it.

Hasbro has been making lots if holiday themed figures in other kinds like Star Wars. These medix colours probably made him jump to conclusions rather than thinking of medix since many fans even of the rescue bots show wouldn't know of that particular reference.

We all know Hasbro has more than one head planned for each release so could the alternate head be G1 Skyquake. Remember that the G1 mold has plenty of redeco potential such as Machine Wars Starscream and King Atlas. And we know this mold will also be used for leader class Prime Universe Dreadwing coming out later in 2023. With the redeco potential for both a more faithful Prime Skyquake and a more faithful G1 Skyquake would you have preferred two seperate molds? Or are you content with this one mold potentially servicing any of your Skyquake needs? Let us know!



Here are the image courtesy of



Leader class Skyquake is really cool. I will say though that I may have mistransformed or missed some things here. It is clearly pre-tooled for an eventual G1/2 Skyquake and possibly even some other figures. I ran into several odd features like the tabs on the top-rear of the alt-mode which seem to have no real function on this figure. The jet cockpit is also able to rotate 180° seemingly for no purpose as it does not appear to actually contribute to the conversion. I am very interested to see the future uses of this mold and feel like it is a great CHUG version of the original Prime character







































































































This is rather interesting. While the three Legacy Prime Universe figures we had so far were a G1-ified version of the Transformers Prime characters they weren't a mix of their Prime selves and any other version of themselves (ie. Arcee wasn't a mix of Prime Arcee and G1 Arcee) but Skyquake is a whole different kind of beast. While the toy is still Prime Universe Skyquake you can see from the images below that both the robot mode and the alt mode are a combo of his Prime self and his G1 self. In bot mode it's mainly the chest area but his alt mode is far more reminiscent of the G1 toy than the original Prime jet with only the cockpit area and colour being more ""Prime"". The rest is all G1 like the rows of vents at the centre and the jet engines integrated into the wings. It is cool to see that this toy bucks the trend of leader class bots being voyager sized with him standing much taller than your standard voyagers.We all know Hasbro has more than one head planned for each release so could the alternate head be G1 Skyquake.

I can already tell this is a figure I'm going to want all five (better be five) versions of. I hope there's some wiggle room for replaceable parts I'd rather G1 Skyquake Starscream and King Atlas have heads more like their original figures and different shoulder pads. Diehard Prime fans are probably going to hate this interpretation especially the default head but I was never a fan of the original Prime head design so I'm fine with this.

I REALLY like this. Even with the obvious pretooled elements and the boxer less angled sculpt this still feels like Prime Skyquake like they have learned from their mis-steps with Bulkhead Arcee and Knockout.

(MARIO GERSHOM REYES/Rafu Shimpo)

By GWEN MURANAKA MICHAEL HIRANO CULROSS and J.K. YAMAMOTO Rafu Staff Writers

Hershey Miyamura the Nisei soldier whose remarkable bravery during the Korean War earned him the Medal of Honor passed away on Nov. 29 in Phoenix Ariz. He was 97.

Miyamura was characteristically humble about his actions near Taejon-Ni Korea but his exploits made him a revered figure especially among Japanese Americans and also in his hometown of Gallup N.M. His life as a veteran was characterized by his generosity in sharing his story and philosophy of living.

In 2014 Nisei Week honored Miyamura as its grand marshal. Speaking to The Rafu he said “I’m just hoping that our new generation will not forget what the veterans did for our country to help preserve our way of life. And hopefully they will carry on the traditions and legacy that the 100th 442nd and MIS left.”

On April 24 1951 as Chinese soldiers threatened to overrun their position Miyamura then a machine-gun squad leader with Company H engaged in close hand-to-hand combat killing approximately 10 of the enemy before returning to administer first aid to the wounded and directing their evacuation.

When another assault hit the line he manned his machine gun until his ammunition was expended and ordered the squad to withdraw while he stayed behind bayoneting his way through infiltrating enemy soldiers to a second gun emplacement and assisting in its operation.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower presented Hershey Miyamura with the Medal of Honor on the White House grounds on Oct. 27 1953 for his actions near Taejon-Ni Korea during the Korean War.

He ordered his men to fall back while covering their movement and killed more than 50 of the enemy before his ammunition was depleted and he was severely wounded but was still seen continuing to fight an overwhelming number of enemy soldiers before being captured.

Miyamura was a prisoner of war for 28 months and received the Medal of Honor from President Dwight Eisenhower after his release in 1953. He returned to Gallup after he was discharged from the Army and worked as an automobile mechanic and service station owner as he and wife Terry raised their three kids. He was the second-to-last living Korean War recipient of the Medal of Honor.

In March Miyamura traveled to Arlington Texas to participate in the groundbreaking for the Medal of Honor Museum.

In a statement the museum said “The NMOHMF is grateful to have had Hershey and his family present at our groundbreaking ceremony in March of this year where he stood to join 15 other recipients in uniting the soil from all 50 states and to break ground on what will soon be a physical embodiment of his humble yet remarkable life and legacy displayed through the Medal of Honor.

“With this great loss to the Medal of Honor community there are now only 64 living recipients of our nation’s highest award for valor in combat. Now more than ever their stories must be preserved and shared for all generations to come.”

In New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham ordered all flags to be lowered to half-staff from Dec. 8 to 10 in Miyamura’s honor.

“I’m saddened to hear of the passing of Hiroshi ‘Hershey’ Miyamura a son of Gallup N.M. and the second-to-last living Korean War Medal of Honor recipient” said Grisham. “We are deeply grateful to him for his incredible service to our state and country – my prayers are with his loved ones.”

He was especially revered in his hometown where the local high school a bridge and a public park bear his name.

Gallup Mayor Louie Bonaguid ordered all flags to be lowered to half-mast saying “Hershey Miyamura was a lifelong resident of Gallup who gave selflessly to his community and country. It is a privilege to honor one of our own in this way and on behalf of the city I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the Miyamura family.”

His enthusiasm for speaking with young people was unwavering; he welcomed impromptu chats in his home with neighborhood kids and even an L.A.-based foreign exchange student group that traveled through the area each spring.

“It’s mainly for the younger generation to help them remember to try to preserve those memories and try to uphold the higher points of life” Miyamura said in 2014. “I don’t claim to be a speaker but I just feel that it’s so important that our young ones know what our fellow veterans have done for us. We enjoy the freedoms we do today because of what they did the sacrifices they made. We should not ever forget it.”

As news of Miyamura’s passing spread the loss was felt keenly in the Japanese American community. Organizers said he will be remembered during Saturday’s Korean War veterans panel to be held in Irvine.

Miyamura and his wife would come to Southern California to attend veterans’ events often carpooling with best friend Joe Annello who would drive from Colorado to Gallup.

Miyamura was captured alongside Annello who was gravely wounded. The Nisei carried Annello as they marched until the Chinese soldiers forced Miyamura at gunpoint to leave Annello on the side of the road to die. The story of the two friends was chronicled in “Forged in Fire” written by the late judge and Vietnam veteran Vincent Okamoto.

Noting that Miyamura also served in World War II 100th Infantry Battalion Veterans (Club 100) said in a statement “Thank you to 100th daughter T.K. Highbridge for letting us know the sad news of the passing of Hiroshi ‘Hershey’ Miyamura 100th veteran and Medal of Honor awardee for his service in the Korean Conflict. If you had the privilege of meeting Hershey he was such a sweetheart so kind and humble. Rest in power Hershey. We love you.”

Ken Hayashi president of the Veterans Memorial Court Alliance in Los Angeles said “He was a patriot who believed in our country and in doing his duty. He was also the most gracious person I ever met. He never said no to requests for photos autographs or just to say hello. He is so well known and beloved in Gallup that he can never eat an uninterrupted meal in a restaurant.

“I first met him when he was one of the honored guests at the dedication of our JA Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1995. I was very fortunate to get to know him and his family in the years after that. He was a true American hero but a JA community treasure who always made an effort to accept invitations to JA community and veterans’ events. He will be dearly missed.”

Carl Miyagishima adjutant Sadao Munemori Post 321 said “He was my hero when I was a kid and eventually a friend. Hershey was humble and straightforward. At our first meeting in Gallup in 2002 he showed me the site of his former gas station and his father’s diner on Third Street. He said that at meetings of Medal of Honor recipients he felt closest to a Vietnam War Air Force pilot who was also captured as a prisoner of war.”

Go For Broke National Education Center President Mitchell Maki said “A gentle soul a hearty laugh and a heart of courage … Today we say goodbye to Hiroshi ‘Hershey’ Miyamura. He was a WWII veteran a Medal of Honor recipient from the Korean War and a true American. Today we say goodbye to a hero an inspiration and most of all a friend.

“Okage sama de … Because of you I am. Thank you Hershey for all you have given to all of America.”

Miyamura is predeceased by his wife Terry. He is survived by three children Mike (Marianne) Pat (Jill) and Kelly Hildahl (Clay); four grandchildren Megan Maj. Marisa (Maj.

Guyanese government officials and executives from New York-based Hess signed off on the agreement late Friday under the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation program (REDD).



This is the second such major deal the country has negotiated in the past decade. Back in 2009 Norway had signed off on a deal to provide $250 million in funding to help ensure the country’s 18 million hectares of forest will remain intact.



Government says it will pursue efforts to secure additional partners in the carbon credit market as the country works to ensure minimal harvesting of its forest resources in a country the size of Britain or the U.S. state of Idaho with less than 1 million inhabitants.



“Guyana is one of the most heavily forested countries in the world. We admire the efforts that Guyana has undertaken for years to protect the country’s forest and the government’s constant efforts to combat climate change and provide a strong model for other countries other businesses and other governments” said John Hess Chief Executive of Hess Corporation at the signing ceremony.



Meanwhile Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo said about 30% of the $750 million will be set aside for developments in Indigenous Amerindian communities. There are nine such tribes in Guyana accounting for about 10% of the population.



""I want to thank Hess Corporation for this agreement. It is clearly transformative and moves us closer to the objectives that we were working on” Jagdeo said.



Hess is a major 35% partner with ExxonMobil and CNOOC of China working in Guyana’s lucrative offshore oil and gas sector in the wake of a major 2015 discovery near the border with Suriname.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9oZXNzLXRvLWJ1eS11czc1MG0taW4tZ3V5YW5hcy1jYXJib24tY3JlZGl0cy1vdmVyLTEwLXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hess to buy US$750m in Guyana’s carbon credits over 10 years,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9oZXNzLXRvLWJ1eS11czc1MG0taW4tZ3V5YW5hcy1jYXJib24tY3JlZGl0cy1vdmVyLTEwLXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C48ED4CE50>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Vice President Dr Bharrat Jagdeo made the disclosure at the historic signing ceremony held at the Baridi Benab State House on Friday.

He said this is in keeping with a commitment that 15 per cent of the proceeds from any sale of forest carbon will go to Amerindian communities in both forested and non-forested areas.

The VP explained that Guyana will be receiving $187 million as payment for what is termed the ‘legacy period’ (2016-2020). For the period 2021 to 2025 a payment of $250 million is expected; and for 2025 to 2030 $350 million under the agreement.

The communities will also decide how these funds will be disbursed and expended.

“It is truly transformative and it moves us closer to two objectives that we were working on for 15 years where the world will value more forest carbon and we’ll move closer to a compliance market even now with this major deal we hope that the voluntary market the prices would go up in the voluntary market were hovering at some abysmally low levels and this one major deal will have global resonance and make a major change” Dr Jagdeo said.

In addition to the 15 per cent the Amerindians will also be direct beneficiaries of all aspects of the Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) 2030 notably from renewable energy and climate adaptation and mitigation projects.

From consultations with residents the government will deliver support through a new phase of the Amerindian Development Fund (ADF); support for participation in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) and ART-TREES; as well as the completion of the land titling programme.

The REDD+ is a framework created by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) to guide activities in the forest sector that reduces emissions from deforestation and forest degradation as well as the sustainable management of forests and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries.

The Architecture for REDD+ Transactions (ART) issued the world’s first TREES credits to Guyana on Thursday.

This also marks a milestone as the first time a country has been issued carbon credits specifically designed for the voluntary and compliance carbon markets for successfully preventing forest loss and degradation — a process known as jurisdictional REDD+.

Following the completion of an independent validation and verification process and approval by the ART Board of Directors ART has issued 33.47 million TREES credits to Guyana for the five-year period from 2016 to 2020. These serialised credits listed on ART’s public registry are available to buyers on the global carbon market.

Chairman of the National Toshaos’ Council (NTC) Derrick John who was also part of Guyana’s delegation to the recently concluded COP27 has welcomed this landmark achievement.

The NTC in a press release following the announcement by ART said the milestone will further support the development of sustainable livelihoods and the protection of forests within Amerindian communities.

“As the national body which represents all elected Indigenous Villages Leaders in Guyana the NTC is pleased that Guyana is pioneering efforts on climate finance that will bring direct benefits to Indigenous peoples in advancing climate resilience and sustainable livelihood opportunities” the NTC stated.

Guyana’s completion of the ART process paves the way for other governments that are looking to receive carbon market finance for success in protecting and restoring forests.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmd5LzIwMjIvMTIvMDMvbm8tc2VsZmlzaC1wbGFuLWphZ2Rlby1zYXlzLWd1eWFuYS1wdW1waW5nLW9pbC1zZWxsaW5nLWNhcmJvbi1jcmVkaXRzLXRvLXByb3RlY3QtYWdhaW5zdC1jbGltYXRlLWNyaXNpcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'No selfish plan' – Jagdeo says Guyana pumping oil selling carbon credits to protect against climate crisis,"Vice President Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo argues that Guyana is not selfishly pursuing its economic interests but it is doing what it has to so that it can be protected against the ongoing climate crisis.

“We have to secure our funding to meet global commitments but to secure this country.

“… Developing the oil and gas sector can allow us to get the revenues to fund the billions of dollars of adaptation needs that we have to meet” the Vice President said while speaking at the State House in Georgetown on Friday.

Guyana hopes to show the world that it can sustainably manage an oil and gas industry while continuing to protect its pristine rainforests that provide life-saving services to the world.

By pursuing this dual agenda the country hopes to earn enough money to strengthen its sea defences improve electricity supply develop other infrastructure and advance social services for its people.

The Vice President does not believe that this is impossible nor does he believe that a prolific oil and gas production will erase Guyana’s environmental credentials.

He says even if there are 10 oilships operating offshore Guyana will still remain a carbon negative country; that is it will store more harmful carbon dioxide than is released into the atmosphere by oil and gas production.

Further he reiterated Guyana’s commitments to global plans. Among those he said is the removal of subsidies from fossil fuel production.

The Former President also called out developed nations for failing to provide adequate funding to smaller developing countries like Guyana- leaving those small countries with no other choice but to fend for themselves.

He reminded the gathering that rich countries promised to provide the entire US$100 billion in funding to developing nations. This target was set at the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference.

Of the amount that was provided he said funds were disbursed as loans and not as grants. So Dr. Jagdeo believes the multilateral process of engagement is simply not working.

“We have no choice but to adapt now and the funds are not going to come through the multilateral process” he lamented.

He also bemoaned that rich countries continue to pump and burn oil and gas to meet their needs- in direct contravention to global low carbon efforts.

The Vice President said “If they want us to move faster to decarbonise the world they should tame their energy demand or alternatively put more money into renewable energy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uZ3kvMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9nb3Z0cy1zdGV3YXJkc2hpcC13aWxsLWhlbHAtZ3V5YW5hLWFkYXB0LXRvLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLW9pbC1jaGFtYmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Govt's stewardship will help Guyana adapt to climate change- Oil Chamber,"See below full statement from GOGEC:

President of the Guyana Oil and Gas Energy Chamber (GOGEG) Manniram Prashad commends the Government of Guyana for yet another historic agreement signed with Hess for the purchase of 2.5 million credits per year for US$750 million from Guyana.

Despite Guyana is projected to ramp up oil production to approximately 1 million barrels per day by the end of the decade Guyana will still enjoy a net negative position in terms of carbon emission.

The Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDs) 2030 sets out the vision for a low carbon economy through low-carbon energy employment and development opportunities and investment in adapting to the impacts of climate change.

The average annual weather-related disaster losses in the last five to ten years in “low” and “lower-middle” income countries have reached US$1.3 billion and US$6.8 billion respectively. Climate impacts undermine resilience and the capacity to recover and absorb losses from these events especially that of poorer countries and their citizens by reducing their agricultural productivity weakening water and food security increasing the incidence of diseases and threatening the existing infrastructure economic productivity and value chains. More focus needs to be placed on the more vulnerable groups who are the victims suffering the most from the wrath of such catastrophes. This should not only be limited to sustainable development work to lift people out of poverty by economic empowerment through education but countries also must divert investment into building climate resilient infrastructure.

In a broader framework to move towards climate resilience countries would need to design disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies. The objective in so doing is to build climate resilient economies while simultaneously developing creative financing solutions over the long term to be able to adequately respond to the financial and economic damages whenever such risks occur in member states.

Guyana’s expanded LCDs framework and this innovative carbon credit model is demonstrative of the Government’s stewardship in successfully leading in these respects."

A suspect is still being sought in the now deadly attack.

The disturbing incident which occurred on Oct. 18 at a Home Depot in Hillsborough North Carolina was caught on the store's surveillance footage.

In the footage the octogenarian employee can be seen approaching the masked suspect as he leaves through the store's garden area with a shopping cart filled with three pressure washers. The suspect can be seen using his right arm to push away the employee sending him to the ground while continuing to push the cart.

The employee was Gary Rasor who had worked with the company for more than nine years a Home Depot spokesperson confirmed. He celebrated his 83rd birthday days after the assault in the hospital.

""We are heartbroken by the loss of our associate Gary"" Margaret Smith a spokesperson for Home Depot said in a statement to ABC News. ""He was an amazing friend husband father and grandfather always willing to help anyone.""

""Hillsborough associates just celebrated his 83rd birthday with him"" the statement continued. ""Right now our top concern is supporting his family and our associates during this difficult time.""

Rasor was an Army veteran who throughout his life worked in various industries including insurance construction and fencing before moving to Durham and working at the Hillsborough Home Depot according to an obituary.

What we know: Firefighters from four Johnson County departments responded to a fire early Sunday morning at a Home Depot store in Shawnee.

At about 12:30 a.m. Shawnee Police dispatchers began receiving calls from people driving by the store on Shawnee Mission Parkway reporting flames from the store located at 15501 West 67th Street.

The store sits south of Shawnee Mission Parkway between Maurer Road and Lackman Road.

What happened: Arriving police and firefighters reported fire visible from the east side of the building near the outdoor garden area.

Police at the scene told the Post that no one was inside the building overnight.

What they’re saying: Shawnee Fire Deputy Chief Corey Sands says the fire was contained to storage racks in the garden center that also houses kerosene.

“The fire sprinkler system in the garden center activated as designed and kept the fire in check until crews arrived to fully extinguish the fire” Sands said. “The fire was declared out in about 25 minutes after first arrival.”

Sands says only the sprinklers in the outdoor garden center activated and the system inside the building did not need to start.

Damage report: A significant amount of smoke did make it inside the building enough that Sands says they called in the Lenexa Fire Department for a special giant fan that helps with ventilation.

“The cause of the fire is still under investigation and fire investigators are working closely with Home Depot” Sands said. “The store remains closed while they clean up.”

Sands says a damage estimate may be available later Sunday.

No firefighters were injured.

A final thing: A Home Depot corporate spokesperson said the Shawnee store would be closed until further notice as the company cleans up and repairs damages.

The investigators urged Medicare officials to strengthen oversight of these private insurance plans which provide benefits to 28 million older Americans and called for increased enforcement against plans with a pattern of inappropriate denials.

Advantage plans have become an increasingly popular option among older Americans offering privatized versions of Medicare that are frequently less expensive and provide a wider array of benefits than the traditional government-run program offers.

It’s your web and social media outreach. It’s your brand and logo. It’s your packaging and customer experience. And yet it’s even more.

“How many senses can I activate with my brand?” said Diego Hodge. “Buying is an emotional experience and you create emotion with your senses. Marketing is anything that activates the senses.”

Hodge the chief operating officer for FLOH Spirits and an investor in business and real estate was one of the panelists in the latest installment of “How To Grow Your Business” webinars presented by Huntington National Bank; this one focused on marketing for small businesses.

Established companies with large footprints are often able to staff specialists in social media e-commerce and graphic design. But that doesn’t mean such processes can’t be scaled down for small businesses. In fact it’s almost a requirement for small start-ups.

“We’re not Beyonce” said Jacquelyn Darby consultant and owner of The Darby Creative House. “We can’t put [product] out there and expect people to run to it.”

The good news is that there are easier ways to market than there were even a decade ago. Adam Armstrong a member of Huntington’s marketing team said that we live in “a golden age of tools.” Automated software can help design a logo. You can develop a web presence with a Squarespace or WordPress site and you can watch tutorials on YouTube.

“You have access to the same solutions as Huntington” he said.

And when you have a brand Darby said it’s crucial to make sure you have a consistent voice for it.

“Your brand voice is how you communicate on all platforms” she said. “It’s the copy of the website it’s how you communicate when someone comes into a store. It’s your advertising copy.”

The most important factor in developing a website is ease of use Darby said. Make sure your content answers any potential questions about your product. You can easily take your own photos with your phone against a white backdrop. And make it easy to purchase your product.

“We’ve all left our carts full because the payment system isn’t as intuitive as we thought it would be” Armstrong said.

Web-based transactions are also important because they provide data about your customer base – which in turn can be used to help retain customers.

“Ten to 20 years ago we didn’t have access to the data we have now” Hodge said. “It wasn’t a guessing game but it was far less exact than it is now.”

It’s important for a small business to know its customer base in order to form a business plan – and that can get lost in the shuffle compared to more immediate operational concerns Armstrong said. But it’s still important.

Even though you’re offering solutions Hodge said those solutions won’t turn into sales unless you’re offering them to the right people.

“I may have a restaurant” he said “but that doesn’t mean everyone who eats is my target. If I’m a personal trainer my competition might not be other personal trainers. It might be a couch and a remote control.”

And above else Hodge said understand you’re making a tough ask: You want someone to make a change.

“You have to understand you’re interrupting relationships” he said. “If I have a problem and I’m solving it I have a relationship with that solution whether it’s effective or ineffective. How do I effectively interrupt a relationship to have someone see what I have and give it a chance?”

TradeLens was a collaborative venture by both entities seeking to use blockchain to improve the supply chain industry. Founded in 2018 the project scored several wins by accumulating a number of high-profile clientele but four years on TradeLens appears to have run out of steam.

According to a statement by the TradeLens team the entire platform is scheduled to go offline before the end of the first quarter. However during the days leading to the close of operations customers have been assured that they will be “attended to without disruptions to their businesses.”

Rotem Hershko Head of Business Platforms at Maersk noted that TradeLens was founded on the vision to change the scope of global supply chain digitization by creating a transparent platform.

“Unfortunately while we successfully developed a viable platform the need for full global industry collaboration has not been achieved” said Hershko. “As a result TradeLens has not reached the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations as an independent business.”

Although the curtain has fallen on TradeLens both parties remain optimistic for the future saying that distributed ledgers will improve processes in the industry. Maersk stated that it will continue its quest to trigger innovation in a bid to “reduce trade friction.”

“We will leverage the work of TradeLens as a stepping stone to further push our digitization agenda and look forward to harnessing the energy and ability of our technology talent in new ways” said Hershko on behalf of Maersk.

Distributed ledgers are permeating every industry

Blockchain has made a foray into virtually every industry and proponents argue that the revolutionary features of transparency and decentralization are game changers. In gaming popular companies like Konami and Sega are looking to incorporate the technology in their upcoming titles to compete with new Web3 game developers.

Blockchain is being explored by central banks and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for its potential in cross-border payments while research labs believe that the tech could be key in securing energy grids from bad actors.

Meanwhile national governments are also increasingly relying on blockchain with India the Philippines and Thailand looking to increase adoption levels for the technology. Other uses of blockchain include its deployment in electioneering processes issuing digital identities and storing the educational records of individuals.

TheReportingProject.org

A typical weekday morning for Maddix Curliss begins at about 5 a.m. He arrives at Lincoln Electric Automation in Columbus by 6:30 – while most 19-year-olds are still sound asleep – for shifts as a service intern learning how to program robots. When he finishes work at 10 a.m. he heads back to his hometown of Newark in time for afternoon classes at Central Ohio Technical College.

Curliss’s ambition can be attributed at least in part to natural discipline and maturity. But perhaps it also can be attributed to the fact that he is working toward a clear goal: Get hired by Intel.

“It sounds like the perfect job opportunity” he said. “A lot of people in my field tend to jump around to different jobs. If I got into Intel I think that’d be my solid job that I’d want to stick with.”

When Curliss enrolled at COTC last fall he did not know that the world’s largest semiconductor company had plans to build facilities virtually in his backyard – 18 miles west of Newark near Johnstown. But word is out now for younger students interested in engineering and COTC is one of the many postsecondary institutions expected to benefit from Intel’s arrival in New Albany.

Intel’s coming to Licking County

On Jan. 21 Intel announced a $20 billion investment in building two plants - called fabs - in Licking County. Intel expects to hire 7000 construction workers and 3000 plant employees throughout the building process.

Speaking to a group of Ohio chief executive officers on May 12 Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger expressed hopes of ultimately investing $100 billion into building eight to 10 fabs in Licking County. He said the plan was contingent on whether Congress would pass the CHIPS Act a bill that would give the semiconductor industry $52.7 billion in aid. It passed and on Aug. 9 President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law.

If Intel follows through with its plan to build up to 10 facilities in New Albany it could hire 15000 workers. Cindi Harper Intel’s vice president of talent planning and acquisition estimated in June that two-thirds of the employees hired to work in the first two plants would come from the Midwest. If the same would be true for the additional plants Intel could provide jobs for 10000 Midwesterners plus thousands more for construction. The opportunities for young Ohioans are not lost on local school administrators.

COTC president: Intel’s arrival “welcomed”

Central Ohio Technical College founded in 1971 offers associate degrees in arts science applied business applied science and technical studies as well as an accelerated bachelor’s degree for diagnostic medical sonography. It has four campuses located in Coshocton Mount Vernon Newark and Reynoldsburg known as the Pataskala Campus.

John Berry took over as president of COTC in 2019. He and other school leaders anticipated significant economic development in the areas they serve prior to Intel’s announcement.

“That whole southwest Licking County corridor was already in major growth mode” he said.

Berry concedes however that no one could have seen a $20 billion semiconductor facilities investment coming.

“Is it welcomed? Absolutely” he said. “But is it an awful lot of work to catch up to knowing how to best serve? Yes that is a process as well.”

Prior to Intel’s Jan. 21 announcement Curliss planned to leverage COTC connections into internship opportunities then working hard enough as an intern to earn himself a full-time job. Now he envisions his professional career starting – and ending – with Intel. Proximity to home company prestige and the prospect of long-term stability draw him to the tech mammoth.

“As far as I can see Intel is going to be amazing for our community” Curliss said. “It’s going to give so many people jobs that weren’t here before.”

For Curliss and other aspiring engineers in Licking County Intel’s arrival is convenient and exciting.

“It’s crazy the timing that this all occurred” he said.

A relationship emerges

Intel met with representatives from Ohio’s 23 two-year colleges in May. At the meeting the schools shared their curricula and Intel shared what it will look for in future employees. This gave the two-year colleges the opportunity to make curricular adjustments that would better prepare students for engineering careers with Intel.

After the meeting Berry reported back to COTC with good news: The school’s existing curriculum was Intel-approved. COTC did not need to create an “absolutely new academic program line” for engineering students he said.

Curliss recalls hearing a similar message from Intel representatives who visited campus.

“It was kind of incidental” he said. “We work with microchips and different transistors and things like that and that all perfectly matches with what Intel needs.”

Since the May meeting COTC and Intel have established what Berry describes as a “standing connection.” He stays in regular contact with Emily Smith Intel Ohio’s public affairs director and Jim Evers Intel Ohio’s general manager. Communication comes with incentive on both sides: Just as Berry wants COTC students to have opportunities with Intel Intel needs to hire a lot of workers many of whom Smith says will come from two-year colleges.

“At our Ohio facility 70% of the 3000 Intel jobs will be manufacturing technicians which are truly the heart and soul of Intel” Smith wrote in an email. “Manufacturing technicians typically hold a two-year degree in a STEM discipline and handle regular preventive maintenance.”

For students such as Curliss lucrative earnings provide another incentive for joining Intel. The average annual salary for the 3000 incoming workers is expected to be $135000.

Spreading the word about a growing field

COTC is capitalizing on the opportunity to use its standing with Intel as a selling point to prospective students. It hosted open houses in Licking Knox and Coshocton counties where Berry saw “a couple hundred people” at each campus. Some students already have been sold on the idea of using COTC degrees as a gateway to Intel careers.

Enrollment in the school’s engineering programs has begun to grow already. Last fall there were 97 students enrolled in the school’s engineering programs. Now there are 117. The growth will almost surely continue. This fall COTC received 164 applications from students intending to study engineering compared to 98 last fall. These numbers include students in the College Credit Plus program which allows students to earn high school and college credit simultaneously and those who are both degree-seeking and non-degree-seeking.

Engineering courses at COTC include Electric Transmission and Distribution Linear Integrated Circuits Digital Electronics and Technology Integration Support. In these classes Curliss is learning how to solve real-world problems.

“In (Digital Electronics) we study how to utilize tools such as transistors and diodes in a circuit to create an electronic with a desired purpose” he said.

COTC is working to strengthen relationships with local high schools. This fall the school hosted four “Superintendent Summits” aimed at teaching high school officials more about College Credit Plus and how COTC can help students toward engineering careers. Cumulatively 32 school officials spanning 23 districts attended the summits and representatives from roughly 20 districts have asked for follow-up meetings.

COTC representatives encourage prospective students interested in Intel careers to consider pursuing the school’s electrical engineering degree or industrial electrician certification.

All throughout the country STEM fields look more enticing than ever for students examining future career paths. According to a Pew Research Center study conducted in 2018 STEM employment grew 79% from 1990 to that year while overall employment grew just 34%. The U.S. Department of Labor predicts STEM employment will grow another 8% from 2019 to 2029.

COTC is awaiting the results of what Berry described as a market analysis project that Intel is working on. He expects the project to detail salary information and the day-to-day functions of an Intel engineer. He looks forward to sharing the information with current and prospective COTC students.

Intel Research Fuels Moore’s Law and Paves the Way to a Trillion Transistors by 2030

At IEDM 2022 on the 75th anniversary of the transistor Intel targets new 10x density improvement in packaging technology and uses novel material just 3 atoms thick to advance transistor scaling.

What’s New: Today Intel unveiled research breakthroughs fueling its innovation pipeline for keeping Moore’s Law on track to a trillion transistors on a package in the next decade. At IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) 2022 Intel researchers showcased advancements in 3D packaging technology with a new 10x improvement in density; novel materials for 2D transistor scaling beyond RibbonFET including super-thin material just 3 atoms thick; new possibilities in energy efficiency and memory for higher-performing computing; and advancements for quantum computing.

“Seventy-five years since the invention of the transistor innovation driving Moore’s Law continues to address the world’s exponentially increasing demand for computing. At IEDM 2022 Intel is showcasing both the forward-thinking and concrete research advancements needed to break through current and future barriers deliver to this insatiable demand and keep Moore’s Law alive and well for years to come.” –Gary Patton Intel vice president and general manager of Components Research and Design Enablement

What’s Happening at IEDM: Commemorating the 75th anniversary of the transistor Dr. Ann Kelleher Intel executive vice president and general manager of Technology Development will lead a plenary session at IEDM. Kelleher will outline the paths forward for continued industry innovation – rallying the ecosystem around a systems-based strategy to address the world’s increasing demand for computing and more effectively innovate to advance at a Moore’s Law pace. The session “Celebrating 75 Years of the Transistor! A Look at the Evolution of Moore’s Law Innovation” takes place at 9:45 a.m. PST on Monday Dec. 5.

Why It Matters: Moore’s Law is vital to addressing the world’s insatiable computing needs as surging data consumption and the drive toward increased artificial intelligence (AI) brings about the greatest acceleration in demand ever.

Continuous innovation is the cornerstone of Moore’s Law. Many of the key innovation milestones for continued power performance and cost improvements over the past two decades – including strained silicon Hi-K metal gate and FinFET – in personal computers graphics processors and data centers started with Intel’s Components Research Group. Further research including RibbonFET gate-all-around (GAA) transistors PowerVia back side power delivery technology and packaging breakthroughs like EMIB and Foveros Direct are on the roadmap today.

At IEDM 2022 Intel’s Components Research Group showed its commitment to innovating across three key areas to continue Moore’s Law: new 3D hybrid bonding packaging technology to enable seamless integration of chiplets; super-thin 2D materials to fit more transistors onto a single chip; and new possibilities in energy efficiency and memory for higher-performing computing.

How We Do It: Components Research Group researchers have identified new materials and processes that blur the line between packaging and silicon. We reveal critical next steps on the journey to extending Moore’s Law to a trillion transistors on a package including advanced packaging that can achieve an additional 10x interconnect density leading to quasi-monolithic chips. Intel’s materials innovations have also identified practical design choices that can meet the requirements of transistor scaling using novel material just 3 atoms thick enabling the company to continue scaling beyond RibbonFET.

Intel introduces quasi-monolithic chips for next generation 3D packaging:

Intel’s latest hybrid bonding research presented at IEDM 2022 shows an additional 10 times improvement in density for power and performance over Intel’s IEDM 2021 research presentation.

Continued hybrid bonding scaling to a 3 um pitch achieves similar interconnect densities and bandwidths as those found on monolithic system-on-chip connections.

Intel looks to super-thin ‘2D’ materials to fit more transistors onto a single chip:

Intel demonstrated a gate-all-around stacked nanosheet structure using 2D channel material just 3 atoms thick while achieving near-ideal switching of transistors on a double-gate structure at room temperature with low leakage current. These are two key breakthroughs needed for stacking GAA transistors and moving beyond the fundamental limits of silicon.

Researchers also revealed the first comprehensive analysis of electrical contact topologies to 2D materials that could further pave the way for high-performing and scalable transistor channels.

Intel brings new possibilities in energy efficiency and memory for higher-performing computing:

To use chip area more effectively Intel redefines scaling by developing memory that can be placed vertically above transistors. In an industry first Intel demonstrates stacked ferroelectric capacitors that match the performance of conventional ferroelectric trench capacitors and can be used to build FeRAM on a logic die.

An industry-first device-level model captures mixed phases and defects for improved ferroelectric hafnia devices marking significant progress for Intel in supporting industry tools to develop novel memories and ferroelectric transistors.

Bringing the world one step closer to transitioning beyond 5G and solving the challenges of power efficiency Intel is building a viable path to 300 millimeter GaN-on-silicon wafers. Intel breakthroughs in this area demonstrate a 20 times gain over industry standard GaN and sets an industry record figure-of-merit for high performance power delivery.

Intel is making breakthroughs on super-energy-efficient technologies specifically transistors that don’t forget retaining data even when the power is off. Already Intel researchers have broken two of three barriers keeping the technology from being fully viable and operational at room temperature.

Intel continues to introduce new concepts in physics with breakthroughs in delivering better qubits for quantum computing:

NAAMA a London-based tattoo removal studio announced it would be offering the free removal in an Instagram post on November 15. In October West went on an antisemitic tirade on social media and donned a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt which triggered businesses like Adidas and Balenciaga to end their partnerships with the rapper and designer. The comments followed West’s yearslong public lurch toward the far right including praise for Donald Trump a longtime obsession with Hitler and calling slavery a “choice” in interviews.

The Kanye West tattoo removal initiative has received “global interest and a great response” said Briony Garbett NAAMA’s CEO in an email to CNN.

“It seems there are a few former fans with tattoo regret” he added.

So far three clients have already begun laser removal on their Kanye West tattoos and 10 more have booked consultation appointments. The process involves using intense pulses of light to break up the tattoo ink which is eventually cleared away by the immune system according to NAAMA’s website.

“When you have a tattoo inspired by someone you admire and they start making headlines for all the wrong reasons it’s not exactly something you want to wear on your sleeve that you are or were a fan” said Garbett. “With that in mind we wanted to come to the aid of those who are embarrassed about their Kanye West-inspired tattoos and are offering complimentary treatment for all UK fans that want them removed.”

One of the clients the studio is currently treating faced social media trolling because of her Kanye West-inspired tattoo according to Garbett.

The Kanye West initiative was born out of the studio’s existing “Second Chances” project which provides free laser tattoo removal for clients with gang tattoos hate symbols or other traumatic or triggering tattoos.

“We understand that tattoos can be triggering for some people and not everyone can afford to remove their tattoos” said Garbett.

The treatment would typically cost around £2000 or $2456 depending on the size of the tattoo and the number of treatments needed.

The OECD was put in charge of developing a plan that ended up consisting of 15 tangible actions that should significantly limit abusive corporate tax practices. Three years later the G20 adopted the plan officially and implementation began across the world in 2016 (Djankov 2021).

In the immediate aftermath of this landmark agreement leaks of questionable corporate tax practices flooded the ether (the Panama Papers Paradise Papers and many more). These bolstered public outrage and led to further political action across the world. In the US the Trump administration passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in late 2017 that almost halved the corporate tax rate in the US and cracked down on profits located in tax havens both actions intent on lowering the incentive to shift profits to tax havens. Meanwhile Margrethe Vestager – named “the tax lady” by Trump – started going after EU member states granting preferential tax deals to multinationals. Finally lowering profit shifting to tax havens became an explicit part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with SDG 16.4.1.

So did all of these plans work? Was profit shifting to tax havens curbed by these global efforts? In a new paper (Wier and Zucman 2022) we investigate this and find that it was not. The increase in artificial profit shifting to tax havens by corporations have been relentless since the 1980’s until today.

Quantitative estimates of global profit shifting

A body of evidence suggests that multinational companies shift profits to tax havens (e.g. Bolwijn et al. 2018 Clausing 2016 Crivelli et al. 2015 Tørsløv et al. 2022). Until now however we have not had a good sense of the dynamic of global profit shifting. Have corporations reduced the amounts they book in tax havens since 2015 or have they found ways to eschew the new regulations? A number of studies provide estimates of global profit shifting but they typically do so for just one reference year. Moreover because these studies rely on different raw sources and methodologies their estimates are not directly comparable making it hard to construct consistent time series by piecing different data points together.

This limits our ability to study the dynamics of profit shifting and to learn about the effects of the various policies implemented to curb it. This paper attempts to overcome this limitation by creating global profit shifting time series constructed following a common methodology. Our series allow us to characterize changes in the size of global corporate profits the fraction of these profits booked in relatively low-tax places and the cost of this shifting for governments of each country.

Our starting point is the estimates from Tørsløv et al. (2022) which are for 2015. Building on the same sources and applying the same methodology we first extend these estimates to cover the years 2015 to 2019 a period that includes the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) process and the US tax reform of 2017. We then construct pre-2015 series back to 1975 which allows us to capture the decades of financial and trade liberalisation that saw a dramatic rise in multinational profits. Due to the lack of some of the input data required to implement the full methodology of Tørsløv et al. (2022) these pre-2015 series are based on additional assumptions and have some margin of error. However the main quantitative patterns that emerge from these series are likely to be reliable.

Our main findings

Global corporate profits grew much faster than global income between 1975 and 2019. The share of profits in global income increased by a third over this period from about 15% to close to 20%. This increase is due both to the rise of the share of global output originating from corporations (as opposed to for example non-corporate businesses) and the rise of the capital share of corporate output. The fast growth of corporate profits means that if the effective global corporate income tax rate had stayed constant global corporate tax revenues (as a fraction of global income) should have increased by about one third since 1975. In reality corporate tax collection has stagnated relative to global income – that is the global effective corporate income tax rate has declined by about a third.

There has been a large rise in multinational profits defined as profits booked by corporations in a country other than their headquarters. The share of multinational profits in global profits has more than quadrupled since 1975 from about 4% to about 18%. This evolution reflects the rise of multinational firms a well-known development but for which a global quantification was lacking so far. The rise has been particularly pronounced since the beginning of the 21st century. This evolution may explain why the issue of how to tax multinational firms has become more salient in the first two decades of the 21st century. When foreign profits accounted for only about 5% of global profits (as was the case from the 1970s through to the late 1990s) the tax revenues implications of properly taxing these profits were relatively small. With the rise of multinational profits the revenue implications are significantly larger.

Figure 1 Corporate profits (% of income) and multinational profits (% of all profits)

There has been an upsurge in the fraction of multinational profits shifted to tax havens. By our estimates this fraction has increased from less than 2% in the 1970s to 37% in 2019. Because multinational profits themselves have been rising much faster than global profits the fraction of global profits (multinational and non-multinational) shifted to tax havens has risen from 0.1% to about 7%. Consistent with these findings we estimate that the corporate tax lost from global profit shifting has increased from less than 0.1% of corporate tax revenues in the 1970s to 10% in 2019. The tax loss is slightly higher than the fraction of profits shifted to tax havens globally because the marginal rate on shifted profits is higher than the average rate.

In 2019 – four years into the implementation of the BEPS process and two years after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – there was no discernible decline in global profit shifting or in profit shifting by US multinationals (which according to our estimates account for about half of global profit shifting) relative to 2015. Of course it is possible that absent BEPS and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act profit shifting would have kept increasing; we do not argue these initiatives had no effect. However their effect seems so far to have been insufficient to lead to a reduction in the global amount of profit shifted offshore. This finding suggests that there remains scope for additional policy initiatives to significantly reduce global profit shifting.

Sofia Danish Khan | New Delhi

By the time Sushant Gaur joined college he could play 10 musical instruments and he had become the drummer in the college band where the now popular singer Samar Puri was a lead vocalist.



But unlike Samar who turned into a professional musician Sushant put his creative skills in business and went on to disrupt the paper bag industry with his innovative sales and marketing strategies.

Delhi-based Sushant started Urja Packaging in 2012 with Rs 15 lakh at the age of 25. Today the company that became Adeera Packaging Pvt Ltd in 2019 has achieved an annual turnover of Rs 28 crore. The company has already touched Rs 37.5 crore this year and is expected to close at Rs 55 crore.“I was a creative student during school time. I was part of the school marching band and in those days learned to play many instruments including the bugle saxophone and congo” says Sushant remembering his childhood days.“Congo made the transition to drumming easier in college. My grandfather saw my interest in music and arranged a music teacher for me and my sister and I learned to play classical flute too.” Interestingly his sister Roli now runs a You Tube channel with about 80k subscribers where she talks about parenting and love.Hailing from Patparganj in Delhi Sushant completed his Class 12 from Delhi Public School Noida in 2004. He joined an engineering college but dropped out a year later since he didn’t find the course interesting.He then got enrolled in MBICEM a Delhi based media institute affiliated to Hissar University where he completed his Bachelors in Mass Communication (2005-2008).At MBICEM he was part of the college band where he met Samar Puri. “He taught me to play the drums. In the course of time I found I enjoyed business management of the band more than drumming” says Sushant.“I prepared for CAT and got into Lal Bahadur Institute of Management in Delhi where I did my MBA in marketing and finance.” After finishing his MBA in 2010 he joined his father who was having about four vehicle service centres in different parts of Delhi.It was a short-lived stint because he soon realised that he had to go to his dad for every small decision. “That’s when I decided I wanted to do something of my own. In 2012 I started Urja Packaging as a proprietorship firm” recounts Sushant.“I invested Rs 15 lakh in setting up machinery and dad guided me at every step. I learnt from him how business is done in India as it is very different from what we learn in B-School. Nobody told us that 75% of our time would be spent in chasing after payments and managing employees. And this became my training ground.”How he got into the paper bag manufacturing business is as interesting as the product itself. He had gone to the Ministry of Environment to seek permission to purchase technology for a renewable energy generator.There he came to know that the single-use plastic was going to be banned soon though the official announcement had not been made yet“With this insight in mind I shifted to paper bag manufacturing. According to research the global plastic market is at USD 250 billion while global paper bag market is USD 6 billion right now though it was at USD 3.5 billion when we started” says Sushant. He believes the paper bags have a great opportunity to replace single use plastic bags.Sushant started Urja Packaging with two machines and 10 employees. Their products are made with recycled paper and paper made from agro waste that is procured from third parties.“We use about 1000 tonnes of paper every month and saving an estimated 17000 trees per month” he says.Getting orders in the initial days of struggle was tough. “Initially I covered the Delhi NCR region myself in my Maruti 800 where I kept the material too; I was doing door to door sales. I showed the samples to the clients; when approved I would deliver the order myself. “The company achieved a turnover of Rs 15 lakh in the first year. They had to encounter plenty of challenges though.“I realized competitors were short-changing customers” he says. They would give lesser GSM paper while charging for a higher quality and would reduce the number of bags in bulk purchases or make the bags an inch or so shorter than the actual size cheating the buyers.Sushant came up with a brilliant idea to disrupt the market and started selling the paper bags by weight. “This took care of the malpractices. Our products were also cheaper (unlike handmade products) since they were machine made and were of better quality” he says.He introduced more innovations like providing generic branding on the bags that became a hit with customers. Since Delhi had many sweet shops with the names of Agarwal Sweets or Bikaner Sweets he printed these names on the bags. The strategy worked well and increased sales.They introduced more sizes and models of bags. “Till then there were only about five standard sizes in the market we introduced 55 different sizes and styles” says Sushant.“I learnt that value is in service. We directly reached the doorstep of buyers with daily deliveries. Since we supplied directly to end stores on-time delivery was important to ensure repeat customers. For this we worked on our logistics and ensured timely delivery.”As home delivery of products came to India with the likes of Grofers and Big Basket the need for paper bags increased. Soon they became exclusive suppliers for Apollo Pharmacy and Big Basket.They now have clients across 70 cities 30000 pin codes with major presence in Delhi Maharashtra and Karnataka.Around 2019-20 two of his friends Atulya Bhatia and Ashish Agarwal joined his business and they became a private limited company with a new name - Adeera Packaging Pvt Ltd.“Atulya owner of Cartonwala a paper bag trading company was our largest customer. Over the years we realized that we had a lot in common including our work ethos. He looks after operations now” says Sushant.“In 2020 Ashish Agarwal an IIFT (Indian Institute of Foreign Trade) graduate joined us as the third partner. He handles all the sales and is the driving force behind the company going international. We have scaled up business in seven countries.“Today we supply to KFC in USA and UK and Taco Bell in UK. 50% of our sales happen through exports now.” The company now has 350 employees located across five factories in Greater Noida and Delhi.In 2014 Sushant got married to Vaishali who is a dietician and runs her own online diet consultation company that has a huge client base in Europe and Australia.The couple has a two-year-old daughter Jigyasa and they love spending time with her.Sushant likes to unwind with his daughter and loves going for long drives with his wife which is almost every other day. The couple went to Dehradun for their last holiday.Sushant talks about the latest deal they have cracked which has a sentimental value for him.“Now we are also supplying to Khan Chacha a popular eatery in the posh market of Delhi where I have often eaten with my friends during my college days.” Sushant signs off knowing there is more to his journey and many more milestones to be achieved. - ©",,,,,,,,,

The parent company of TurboTax QuickBooks and Credit Karma announced that it planned to combine SeedFi’s Credit Builder technology with Credit Karma which has already been partnering with the San Francisco-based startup since last year in its efforts to help consumers improve their financial standing and credit scores.

“By combining SeedFi’s Credit Builder technology with Credit Karma’s long-standing relationships with credit bureaus and others in the credit ecosystem Intuit will be able to move with greater speed and scale to help Credit Karma members make financial progress” the company said in a news release last week.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed but Intuit said the existing Credit Builder program allows members to make regular bill payments of just $20 per month or $10 per paycheck and then report that info to the credit bureaus.

Although high inflation rising interest rates increasing layoffs and economic uncertainty have caused unprecedented belt-tightening and constrained household budgets Intuit said members of the Credit Builder program improved their financial health and increased their scores by an average of 21 points in as little as 30 to 45 days while also building up more than $10 million in savings.

“This acquisition will enable Credit Karma Money to continue to build on that momentum and help put more members on a path to financial security” the release said.

The company points to a recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) study that found that almost 75% of Americans with no emergency savings have credit scores under 660 a correlation that persists as time goes on.

And even Americans who do have emergency savings often don’t have enough LendingClub Financial Health Officer Anuj Nayar told PYMNTS in September.

For years $400 was the go-to figure for emergency savings but research by PYMNTS and LendingClub shows that most emergencies actually cost consumers $1400 on average.

Nayar said inflation has driven up the cost of all manner of expenses to the point where even buying a replacing a tire after a flat can easily run several hundred dollars while an emergency room visit can cost thousands.

It’s been well documented at this point that the paycheck-to-paycheck economy includes a majority of American consumers who have little if anything left over to save once they’ve paid the bills every month.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Mountain Iron-Buhl (MIB) football team pulled off the comeback of their careers Saturday morning besting Spring Grove 28-25 to claim the 9-Man state football championship and finish their season undefeated at U.S. Bank Stadium.

This marked MIB’s first state championship appearance since 1972 the first year of the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) state football tournament when the Rangers also won it all.

Spring Grove would strike first just over four minutes into the game to lead 7-0 from an Elijah Solum touchdown. Then just over a minute later the Lions recovered a fumble and on the next play Tysen Grinde scored a touchdown. MIB blocked the extra point attempt to trail just 13-0.

The Rangers would struggle with possession turning over the ball three times in the first quarter to trail 19-0 after also blocking a two-point conversion attempt.

Damian Tapio with under three minutes to go in the second quarter carried in an 11 yard touchdown to break MIB onto the board. Tapio then took in the two-point conversion to trail just 19-8. That’s when the momentum shifted. Six seconds before halftime Asher Zubich connected with Nik Jesch in the endzone for a 20 yard completion to trail 19-14.

Spring Grove scored the first touchdown of the second half after another MIB fumble however the Rangers would once again foil a conversion attempt to trail 25-14. In the fourth quarter Zubich would hit Riley Busch for a 63-yard touchdown to trail 25-20.

With 25 seconds to go in the game Tapio hauled in a 10 yard touchdown giving MIB their first lead of the game. They converted for two points to lead 28-25.

Zubich finished passing for 168 yards on 13 completions. Defensively MIB was led by Mason Clines recording four of the team’s 10 pass break-ups.

The Rangers held the Lions on the ensuing drive forcing an incompletion by Lions quarterback Elijah Solum and taking their first state championship since 1972 with a 28-25 win.

MIB ran for 210 yards led by quarterback Asher Zubich’s 136. Tapio rushed for 97 yards and both the Rangers’ scores on the ground.

Tapio said he only felt one thing when he crossed the goal line: “stress relief.”

“All my stress was gone out there” he said. “It’s just a great feeling scoring the game-winning touchdown in the state championship game.”

Any chance of a state championship was in serious doubt after a disastrous first quarter for MIB. Spring Grove took the opening kick and marched the ball 77 yards capped by a 5-yard scoring run by Solum.

Tapio fumbled on the Rangers’ opening drive and Solum made it 14-0 with a 43-yard touchdown pass on the next play.

A few minutes later MIB finally stopped the Lions but Gallus Colton muffed the punt and set Spring Grove up on the Rangers’ 20-yard line. Hunter Holland made it 19-0 on a 12-yard run two plays later.

Zubich threw an interception with three seconds left in the quarter but left Spring Grove deep in its own territory. The Rangers forced the Lions to punt again setting MIB up at the Spring Grove 41.

The Rangers spent almost all of the second quarter on Spring Grove’s side of the field. Tapio scored from 11 yards out to get MIB on the board and Zubich found Nik Jesch with time running out in the half to make the score 19-14.

The Lions had several chances to put the game away in the second and third quarter but just couldn’t make the plays.

“We lulled ourselves to sleep a little bit I feel like we took our foot off the gas pedal a little bit” Spring Grove’s Ty Cleven said. “We just didn’t get back to what we need to get back to.”

After Spring Grove’s first two scores the MIB defense stiffened and the Lions’ last two scoring drives consisted of 20 and 24 yards. Rangers coach Dan Zubich said it was more a matter of execution than making a change defensively.

“I don’t know if they were awake yet” coach Zubich said. “We were leaving one guy unblocked on offense in the first half. On defense it was the same thing they were in the wrong spots. If you’re in the right spots but sometimes at the beginning you’re too amped up even with a veteran crew like this one. Once we rectified that we were good to go.”

Spring Grove led 25-14 going into the fourth quarter but after MIB stopped the Lions on a fourth down Zubich found Riley Busch for a 63-yard score.

MIB was driving for a potential go-ahead score but Jaxon Strinomen picked off Zubich in the end zone.

“With that last one I thought that was going to be it” coach Zubich said. “But I told them ‘Get the ball back we will score.’”

With Spring Grove trying to milk the clock the Lions rushed Solum on five of six plays. Facing a third-and-10 Solum launched a pass that was picked off by MIB’s Micaden Clines — his second interception of the fourth quarter — setting up Tapio’s heroics.

Zubich said it definitely looked bad early but his team kept “fighting like hell” and kept themselves in the game.

“A lot of people don’t even get a chance to play this game and we took it as the chance of a lifetime” Zubich said. “We told ourselves before the game we told ourselves it was going to be rough there were going to be lots of downs — probably more downs than ups — but we turned it into an up. We had pride we had heart and we just kept fighting.”

With the first state title in 50 years the Rangers have reached a level they had only dreamed about just a few hours earlier.

“For us — speaking as a team — that team was our idol” Zubich said. “We looked back on them after every practice we mentioned their name that ‘72 team. That just shows that 50 years from now we’ll still be talked about.”

J.B. Hunt gives $55K back to classrooms

Supply chain solutions provider J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. announced Tuesday it has granted $55000 to 55 classrooms throughout the country during its annual Adopt-a-Class initiative.

Founded in 2013 the kindergarten through fifth grade classroom program enables drivers of J.B. Hunt to nominate their child or grandchild’s classroom with an essay submission to receive a $1000 donation to go toward school supplies and other classroom essentials. Teachers and parents often pay for classroom supplies with their own money throughout the school calendar year.

“Adopt-a-Class is one of my favorite programs we offer at J.B. Hunt because it enriches education for students all throughout the country specifically for the families of our drivers” said Craig Harper executive vice president and chief sustainability officer at J.B. Hunt. “Teachers work hard to ensure their students have the resources they need to be successful and it’s imperative we do our part in giving back to the communities we live in.”

(NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Check out our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady in line with previous estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$181 with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.

Following on from that line of thought we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St we have a full range of analyst estimates for Jack Henry & Associates going out to 2026 and you can see them free on our platform here..

The Texas Rangers will pay new starting pitcher Jacob deGrom $30 million in the first year of his five-year contract according to multiple reports on Friday.

The Rangers did not announce terms of the deal. But The Dallas Morning News The Athletic and MLB.com all had the terms via a source.

deGrom’s five-year deal includes a significant raise in the second and third years of the deal as deGrom will make $40 million in each season. From there the money takes its foot off the gas just a bit as the Rangers will pay him $38 million in 2026 and $37 million in 2027.

The average annual value of deGrom’s deal is $37 million which will be the luxury tax figure. With his $30 million salary in 2023 he will be paid slightly less than shortstop Corey Seager who will make $35.5 million next season.

deGrom’s salary will then overtake Seager’s in 2024 and he’ll be the highest-paid Rangers player for the remainder of his contract.

Those yearly figures bring the value of deGrom’s contract to $183 million.

The question is how much deGrom might make in the sixth year of the contract which is a conditional option. That figure wasn’t disclosed. But the conditional option year will take deGrom to age 40 assuming it’s triggered.

ESPN reported that the sixth year could take the contract to $222 million.

The Rangers announced the deal on Friday after deGrom passed his physical. At $37 million deGrom’s contract is the second-highest annual value of any starting pitcher’s salary behind only Max Scherzer who signed with the New York Mets last year and makes an average salary of $43 million.

deGrom had pitched for the Mets his entire career before his agreement with the Rangers on Friday.

deGrom joins three veteran Rangers starters under contract for 2023 — Martín Pérez Jon Gray and Jake Odorizzi.

It’s a reported $185MM guarantee and the deal also includes a full no-trade clause. The VC Sports Group client will make $30MM next season followed by successive $40MM salaries in 2024-25 $38MM in 2026 and $37MM in 2027.

The contract also contains a conditional option for the 2028 campaign with salaries dependent on the health of deGrom’s arm over the first four seasons. If the hurler undergoes Tommy John surgery or suffers any elbow or shoulder injury that leads to a 130-day injured list stint within a season or a full calendar year absence over multiple campaigns a club option would kick in. That’d be valued at $20MM but it’d jump to $30MM if deGrom posts a top-five Cy Young finish at any point during the deal or tallied a cumulative 625 innings over the next five seasons. It’d go to $37MM if he pitches 725-plus frames or secures three top-five Cy Young finishes.

If deGrom doesn’t suffer the kind of injury that’d trigger the conditional provision he could vest the 2028 option at $37MM by pitching 160+ innings in ’27 and securing a top-five Cy Young finish. In that case he’d only need to pass a postseason physical to max out the contract at $222MM over six seasons.

“We are thrilled that Jacob deGrom has decided to become a Texas Ranger” general manager Chris Young said in the press release. “Over a number of seasons Jacob has been a standout Major League pitcher and he gives us a dominant performer at the top of our rotation. One of our primary goals this off-season is to strengthen our starting pitching and we are adding one of the best.”

It’s the biggest move of the offseason to date and the latest massive free agent strike out of Arlington. The Rangers committed more than a half-billion dollars to the trio of Corey Seager Marcus Semien and Jon Gray last winter. That was designed to lay the foundation for a full-fledged return to contention in 2023. The Rangers didn’t see their desired steps forward from a win-loss perspective in 2022 largely because of a lackluster rotation behind Gray and Martín Pérez. Texas has suggested they were prepared to attack the top of the market to fortify the biggest weak point on the roster. They’ve done so with a shocking five-year deal for arguably the sport’s best pitcher.

deGrom is one of the most accomplished arms of his generation. While he fell to the ninth round of the 2010 draft and didn’t reach the majors until just shy of his 26th birthday in 2014 he immediately cemented himself as one of the game’s top pitchers. deGrom worked to a 2.69 ERA in his first 22 starts to secure the NL Rookie of the Year award and kick off a career as one of the league’s top hurlers.

The righty posted an ERA between 2.54 and 3.53 in each of the next three seasons twice receiving down-ballot Cy Young support. Already a borderline ace he took his game to new heights in 2018. deGrom twirled 217 innings with an MLB-best 1.70 ERA to secure his first Cy Young. The Mets inked him to a $120.5MM extension after that season. He followed up by repeating as the Senior Circuit’s best pitcher claiming a second Cy Young with a 2.43 mark over 204 innings. He had another dominant season in the abbreviated 2020 campaign and got off to one of the greatest first halves in history in ’21.

Through his first 15 starts that year the four-time All-Star posted a microscopic 1.08 ERA while striking out an incredible 45.1% of opposing hitters. He was nagged by some minor health issues throughout the first few months and that culminated in an injured list stint for forearm tightness right around the All-Star Break. While that wasn’t initially expected to lead to an extended absence deGrom would wind up missing the remainder of the season. That September New York president Sandy Alderson said deGrom had been dealing with a low-grade tear in his UCL an eyebrow-raising assertion considering the right-hander had undergone Tommy John surgery before making his MLB debut. The pitcher refuted that calling his ligament “perfectly fine.”

After a full offseason deGrom was expected to return in 2022. Late in Spring Training he felt some soreness during a between-starts throwing program. He was diagnosed with a stress reaction in his scapula and shut back down and the injury wound up costing him the first four months of this past season. By the time he returned to the mound in early August more than a full calendar year had gone by.

With that kind of layoff one might’ve expected deGrom to show some signs of rust. Instead he returned as his peak self immediately dominating opponents yet again. The Stetson product averaged an absurd 98.9 MPH on his fastball and 92.6 MPH on the cutter/slider that serves as his go-to secondary offering. He struck out 42.7% of opponents against a minuscule 3.3% walk percentage. Opposing hitters swung and missed at 21.1% of his total pitches; no other starting pitcher with 50+ innings had a swinging strike rate above 17%. He struck out eight over six innings during his lone playoff start against San Diego.

A three-homer outing in Atlanta to end his season kicked deGrom’s ERA up to 3.08 in his abbreviated season but there’s little doubt he’s still capable of performing at his top level if healthy. No pitcher on the planet is as dominant as deGrom on a per-start basis. He predictably opted out of the final $32.5MM on his deal with the Mets at the end of the season.

High-upside as this signing can be for the Rangers there’s certainly plenty of risk in this kind of commitment to a pitcher who lost significant chunks of the past two seasons with arm issues. He’s worked just 162 1/3 innings (including playoffs) since the start of 2021. While deGrom had no control of the prorated season in 2020 he’ll still be expected to shoulder a full rotation workload despite having tossed just 224 1/3 cumulative innings over the last three years.

deGrom turns 35 years old in June. There’s no indication he’s on the verge of any performance regression. Texas’ commitment runs through his age-39 campaign and there’s the potential for the deal to go sideways if his form tails off later into his 30’s. Now-former teammate Max Scherzer and fellow top free agent Justin Verlander have shown it’s not of the question for a pitcher to remain at peak form as he approaches 40. Neither Scherzer nor Verlander had dealt with the kind of injuries in their mid-30’s that have plagued deGrom though.

The $185MM guarantee significantly tops MLBTR’s three-year $135MM prediction at the start of the offseason. It’s the sixth-largest deal for a free agent pitcher in MLB history trailing those of Gerrit Cole ($324MM) Stephen Strasburg ($245MM) David Price ($217MM) Scherzer ($210MM with the Nationals) and Zack Greinke ($206.5MM). The deal contains a $37MM average annual value that ranks second among any deal in big league history. Only Scherzer’s three-year pact with the Mets — which came out to $43.333MM per season — is higher.

Next year’s $30MM salary will bring Texas’ projected 2023 payroll commitments to around $170MM. That’d be a franchise-record tally for the Rangers but there’s no indication the organization is planning to curtail spending any time soon. Owner Ray Davis and Young have each indicated there’s room for the club to be active on the open market and there’s still plenty of work to be done in turning their 68-win roster into a contender in a difficult AL West. Young and skipper Bruce Bochy are each headed into their first full season at the helm and they’ll expect to break a six-year playoff drought.

deGrom goes to the top of a rotation that brings back Gray and Pérez who accepted a qualifying offer. The Rangers acquired Jake Odorizzi from the Braves at the start of the offseason and Dane Dunning is a decent back-of-the-rotation arm. That’s a viable starting five but the team’s rotation depth is still lacking and they could add another arm from outside the organization. The infield and catcher are in strong shape. Adolis García is the only outfielder who’s guaranteed everyday reps leaving two spots that could be addressed and the team figures to add at least one reliever.

The contract contains a $37MM luxury tax hit. The average annual values of a team’s commitments are relevant for competitive balance tax purposes. Signing deGrom brings Texas around $192MM in estimated CBT figures per Roster Resource leaving them around $40MM shy of the lowest $233MM threshold.

The Mets will have to rapidly turn the page bidding farewell to one of the best pitchers in franchise history. New York has also seen Chris Bassitt Taijuan Walker and Trevor Williams hit free agency. They’re sure to add to a starting staff led by Scherzer and Carlos Carrasco. Free agency offers a pair of remaining aces in Verlander and Carlos Rodón and the big-spending Mets have previously been tied to both pitchers. Losing deGrom only figures to increase their urgency to bring in one of those two hurlers and they’ll need to retain or replace free agent center fielder Brandon Nimmo.

New York receives modest compensation for deGrom’s departure. The team made him a qualifying offer at the start of the offseason which he rejected. As a team that paid the luxury tax in 2022 New York receives the lowest compensation: a pick after the fourth round of next year’s amateur draft. The Rangers neither paid the luxury tax nor received revenue sharing this year. They’ll therefore surrender their second-highest pick in next year’s draft and forfeit $500K in international signing bonus space. Should they sign another qualified free agent this offseason — both Seager and Semien had turned down a QO last winter — they’d be stripped of their third-highest selection.

Jeff Passan of ESPN was first to report deGrom received a $185MM guarantee and that the deal contained a conditional sixth-year option that could push its value to $222MM. Levi Weaver of the Athletic reported the yearly salary terms. Ronald Blum of the Associated Press reported the details of the 2028 option.

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hwb3N0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvcGdhLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvd2h5LWR1c3Rpbi1qb2huc29uLXNheXMtbGl2LXBsYXllcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLXJld2FyZGVkLWluLXBnYS10b3VyLW1lcmdlci83MzYyOTg3NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Dustin Johnson says LIV players should be rewarded in PGA Tour merger,"Dustin Johnson has a completely different take on those who shunned the PGA Tour for LIV Golf and those who are being hailed as loyalists for remaining on the tour.

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

Johnson was placed on the 15-day injured list during the last road trip due to elbow inflammation.

Pierce Johnson is doing well Brian Snitker said. He was scheduled to throw a touch-and-feel off the bullpen mound today.



No update on Tyler Matzek. He’s been shut down from throwing for a brief period. — Justin Toscano (@JustinCToscano) May 10 2024

Brian Snitker had previously said that they didn’t think the situation with Johnson’s elbow was serious but they wanted to get ahead of it. Johnson has been a key piece of the Braves’ bullpen since he was acquired at the trade deadline last season. Johnson has appeared in 13 games and has a 3.00 ERA and a 2.83 FIP in 12 innings.

Per Toscano there was no update on Tyler Matzek who was also placed on the 15-day injured list with his own bout of elbow inflammation. Matzek has been shut down from throwing.

Matzek missed all of the 2022 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. There was initially talk of him beginning the season on the injured list but he showed enough during the spring to earn a spot on the Opening Day roster. Things haven’t gone well for Matzek though as he has allowed 11 runs in 10 innings across 11 appearances. He’s been hit particularly hard of late allowing six earned runs in his last three innings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tYWZpZ2h0aW5nLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM3MjMvZGVtZXRyaW91cy1qb2huc29uLXJldmVhbHMtaG93LW11Y2gtbW9uZXktaGVzLW1hZGUtZnJvbS1lYS11ZmMtZ2FtZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Demetrious Johnson reveals how much money he's made from EA UFC games,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tYWZpZ2h0aW5nLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM3MjMvZGVtZXRyaW91cy1qb2huc29uLXJldmVhbHMtaG93LW11Y2gtbW9uZXktaGVzLW1hZGUtZnJvbS1lYS11ZmMtZ2FtZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C48EB19D80>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

JPM,JPMorgan Chase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzAzL2JldHRlci1idXktanBtb3JnYW4tY2hhc2Utb3ItbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: JPMorgan Chase or Morgan Stanley?,"Which of these two investment banking giants should you add to your portfolio now?

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.64%) and Morgan Stanley (MS 0.17%) are two of the biggest investment banks in the world. But these financial services giants are also leaders in different markets and have titanium brands that are known the world over.

This bear market cycle has been a mixed bag for financial firms -- banks and wealth managers have done relatively well while investment banks and asset managers suffered. So how did these two financial behemoths performed and which of the two is the better buy today?

How they are different

While these two investment banking giants have major similarities there are some key differences between them.

JPMorgan Chase operates the country's largest consumer bank Chase. It has four major segments -- consumer and community banking; corporate and investment banking; commercial banking; and asset and wealth management.

The largest consumer banking generated $14.3 billion in revenue in the third quarter about 42.4% of the institution's total. Investment banking produced about 35.1% of revenue but in the prior-year quarter it was about 42%. Asset management represents about 13.4% of revenue while commercial banking accounts for 9%.

Morgan Stanley has a much smaller consumer banking arm but through its acquisition of E*Trade a few years ago it is one of the largest brokerage firms and wealth managers in the United States.

Morgan Stanley has three primary business lines: institutional securities which includes investment banking securities trading and corporate lending; wealth management which includes brokerage investment advisory and wealth management banking among other services; and investment management which includes managing retail funds institutional assets alternative investments and other products.

In the third quarter wealth management generated about 47% of revenue while institutional securities accounted for 45% -- but that was down from 51% in the prior-year period. Investment management accounted for about 9% of revenue.

So what does this all mean?

Which one is a better buy?

This market cycle features the type of conditions that JPMorgan Chase was built to withstand. That's evident in its ability to generate higher revenue -- its top line jumped 10% year over in the third quarter. While its investment banking revenue was down consumer banking and wealth management revenue was up. Earnings were lower year over year as the company had to set aside higher provisions for credit losses.

Morgan Stanley does not have quite the diversity of revenue as JPMorgan Chase which is less reliant on investment banking and has a much bigger consumer banking arm that has been buoyed by robust lending and higher interest rates. Revenue in the most recent quarter was down by about 11% year over year for Morgan Stanley. However Morgan Stanley has added ballast in growing its wealth management business which kept the firm pretty steady in rough seas.

So the edge there goes to JPMorgan Chase. It also wins in several other categories including valuation -- its 10.6 price-to-earnings ratio is lower than that of Morgan Stanley. JPMorgan Chase also has a strong balance sheet with $1.4 trillion in cash and $90 billion in operating cash flow and it's extremely efficient with a return on equity of 12.8% and an efficiency ratio of 59% -- which is down from the end of 2021.

While the next few quarters could be difficult I would consider both of these stocks good long-term buys. And both of them offer robust dividend payouts. But ultimately if I had to pick one it would be JPMorgan Chase which has more balanced revenue streams a fortress balance sheet a better valuation excellent efficiency and is built for the long haul.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFya2FuYWdhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9kZWMvMDMvZnJhdWQtb24tcGF5bWVudC1hcHAtemVsbGUtaXMtb24tdGhlLXJpc2UtaG93LWNhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fraud on payment app Zelle is on the rise. How can you stay safe?,"People are increasingly falling victim to fraud on the payment service Zelle lured by scammers impersonating bank officials via text message or phone call -- and in response to the prevalence of fraud some banks are responding with a plan to reimburse scammed customers.

Zelle allows users to send and receive money instantly and without a fee. But unlike other mobile payment services like Venmo and Cash App the platform is partially owned by banks.

Seven big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America partnered to form fintech company Early Warning Services to run Zelle. The app was created in 2017 to compete with other electronic-payment services.

But a report issued by Sen. Elizabeth Warren a Massachusetts Democrat in October found that the app ""facilitates fraudulent activity of many kinds"" and often does not repay swindled customers. Warren is a longtime critic of the banking industry and launched an investigation into Zelle in April.

""Big banks own and profit from Zelle but are failing to make their customers whole for both authorized and unauthorized fraudulent activity on the platform despite their claims that it is safe and that they have a 'zero liability' policy for fraud"" Warren's office wrote.

The report also found that customers are set to lose more than $255 million to scammers by the end of this year.

But schemes involving money and manipulation aren't new. Digital wallets like Zelle have simply introduced a new method for fraudsters said Monica Horton spokeswoman for the Better Business Bureau of North Central Texas.

She said digital payment scams are on the rise because the transaction is similar to handing someone cash.

""Scammers used to ask you to wire-transfer money because it wasn't traceable. Then they migrated over to sending you fake checks for you to take to the bank"" Horton said. ""Now they are using these payment platforms to steal your money.""

How does a Zelle scam work?

Zelle allows people to transfer money to anyone through their phone number or email address which may make it easier for bad actors to take advantage of users.

Scams on Zelle usually involve a text message that appears to be from a bank. These messages often ask victims whether to authorize a large payment from Zelle by texting back a ""yes"" or ""no.""

After the person responds to the fake message fraudsters will call the user under the guise of reversing the unauthorized transaction. Phone calls are spoofed to appear as though they're being made by the bank.

The scammer then asks for the victim's username and password to verify their identity and transfers money out of their account.

""Scammers have adapted all of the typical scams to use this new technology because they know if you send money to someone it's similar to handing someone cash"" Morton said.

Another popular scam employs urgency in order to encourage users to act fast and share their banking information. Some fraudsters have also posed as utility companies threatening to cancel the user's electricity's service. Zelle reports this often occurs during periods of peak energy usage.

Will you get your money back?

It's unlikely you will get your money back if you were scammed on Zelle.

Only unauthorized transfers are protected for customers according to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978. Otherwise it is difficult to recover money you've knowingly sent to someone which is considered an authorized transfer under the law.

The service also does not offer a protection program on authorized payments.

""Even if you were tricked or persuaded into authorizing a payment for a good or service someone said they were going to provide but they didn't fulfill it this would be considered a scam. Because you authorized the payment you may not be able to get your money back"" Zelle's website says.

It is more likely you will get your money back if you report an incident in which you weren't involved with the transaction including someone gaining access to your account without permission.

How to use digital wallets safely

There are some ways to protect yourself from being scammed by digital wallets according to the BBB and Zelle:

--Only send payments to people you know. ""Peer-to-peer payment services were designed for simply that"" Horton said. ""You're paying somebody back for lunch or reimbursing a friend for something.""

--Beware of scams that don't sound reasonable such as tickets sold at a steep discount. ""If an offer sounds too good to be true it probably is"" Zelle says on its website.

--Double check your recipient's contact information. Ask your friend to confirm their phone number or email as Zelle generally does not protect users sending money to the wrong person.

--Steer clear of fake texts and email addresses. Don't click on links from messages and never provide your personal banking information over the phone. The BBB writes that payment apps will only ask you for your password on their login page.

""The general advice for consumers is don't trust any unsolicited message regardless of the form it comes in. ... Scammers will use various tactics to get you to click on a link or call a number"" Horton said.

If you've lost money to a fraudster you can report it to the FBI's Internet Complaint Crime Center at ic3.gov. Zelle also recommends reporting it to your bank or credit union.

The BBB has a Scam Tracker portal at bbb.org/scamtracker where you can report a scam or look up existing ones.

“Ever since I could remember my mother and my grandmother talked about wanting to open their own restaurant. They loved cooking for church and community events. … Unfortunately my grandmother is gone now so she didn’t get to see this dream come to life. But my mother is still here and every day we are grateful that the doors opened for us” said Martin who co-founded Love is Key alongside her husband Cameron.

The Martins’ waffle concept restaurant Love is Key celebrated its grand opening in August on the first floor of the Wonder Shops and Flats development on 30th Street and Troost Avenue. Love is Key specializes in waffle sandwiches and cake waffles a family recipe passed down from Martin’s mother Tangela Winters and grandmother Daisy Henderson.

Startland News The waffle sandwiches and cake waffles at Love is Key come from Martin family recipes.

“We put a lot of thought into our menu” Martin noted. “From using my mother and grandmother’s recipes for the dishes and desserts to using local vendors and local food our food quality is phenomenal. We are very conscious about the seasoning we use and we even have our own in-house caramelized syrup that no one is using. It is our specialized ingredient.”

Humble beginnings

Love is Key originally began as a dessert catering company in 2018.

“My mother has been a nurse all her life but she got sick and stopped working” Martin recalled. “One day I came home and she had the entire counter lined up with caramel cake. I was like ‘Who’s going to eat all of this cake?’ and she said that they were orders. That’s when I knew we were going to turn this into a business.”

The Martins and her mother began booking weddings community events and grand openings she said. The business was steadily scaling when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

After a short hiatus a small pop-up space in the parking lot of Ruby Jeans Kitchen and Juicery catty-corner to Wonder Shops and Flats became available and Love is Key launched its pilot program in Fall 2020.

“For about a year we opened up Tuesday through Saturday to see if we could sustain a physical location” Martin said. “We broke even which is really unheard of for restaurants. Most restaurants don’t make a profit for three to five years so that gave us the confidence to go for it. We are believers in Christ and God so we prayed about this. And we’ve been blessed.”

When Martin got the call that a storefront right across from her pop-up shop opened up in the Wonder Shops and Flats — the former Soulcentricitea location — she immediately knew that she wanted to be a part of it she shared.

“We are all for economic development within our own community” Martin said. “Having more businesses in this area will create more jobs and lower crime. It also gives people an opportunity to work in their own community versus going outside.”

Love is Key has been a self-funded venture Martin said adding that she and her husband are in search of additional funds to keep the business growing.

“We’ve had incredible mentors like David and Samantha Park who really taught us about financial literacy and business” Martin said. “They helped us with budgeting so we could self-fund the entire launch. Self-funding the start was a hard journey. We dropped our expenses extremely low so we could save money — but we believe in entrepreneurship. We know it is the answer to resolve economic issues within our community.”

Startland News Tameisha and Cameron Martin were awarded a $15000 grant in November from the JPMorgan Chase Foundation in partnership with the Porter House KC.

‘A social worker at heart’

Before her journey with Love is Key Martin received a master’s degree in social work and worked as a licensed medical social worker. Although she is passionate about entrepreneurship she carries with her the lessons she learned as a social worker she shared.

“I use my people skills every day” Martin said. “When you’re in the service industry you’re going to have people from all walks of life come into your space. If they don’t feel welcome they won’t come back.”

The key to making others feel welcome: listening.

Startland News Martin has a master’s degree in social work and has worked as a licensed medical social worker.

“It’s about listening and understanding what the market wants and then providing that” she said. “I needed to listen to my clients to help them get back on track. With both (an entrepreneurial and social worker) mindset you need to be resilient. When things get hard you have to know how to persevere and get through it.”

“Cater with love” is one of Martin’s slogans she said noting that she partners with organizations that benefit underserved communities.

“I am still a social worker at heart; through Love is Key I can still help those populations that I was helping when I was a social worker” Martin said. “We’ve worked with the Ronald McDonald House and various school districts. We partner with Truman Employment Services that brings in employees who are having mental health issues or physical issues and are wanting to get put back into the workforce. We help get them adjusted.”

Love is Key is also partnering with Amethyst Place down the street to hire mothers who are struggling with substance abuse mental health or other disabilities.



Scaling deep

Making an impact within their community is crucial for Martin she said. Rather than focusing on expanding her business to multiple locations she is currently committed to scaling deep.

“We focus on scaling deep which means we want to make a social and economic impact in our own community” Martin said. “So we’re focusing on being a staple here in Kansas City so that we can continue to hire people in our own community and continue with the revitalization of this area. We love the urban core. We live in this area and it just makes sense to help be here.”

The Martins are working to get more foot traffic through the door as catering is still the bulk of their business Martin said pointing to more than 100 box lunches she was preparing for the next day.

Startland News “Cater with love” is one of Martin’s slogans. Her business partners with organizations that benefit underserved communities.

To scale deeper and get more of the community involved Martin enjoys partnering with other local businesses when possible. The coffee served at Love is Key is Black Drip Coffee — a Black-owned coffee company in Kansas City.

The name Love is Key is a direct reflection of Martin’s mother and grandmother she shared.

“They used to say that if you do things with love and with the right heart posture it’ll come back to you” Martin recalled. “I wanted to highlight that because whether it’s catering or cooking anything that we do we always want to operate in excellence.”

Love is Key is open 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.

The world’s largest gold exchange traded fund is to store some of its inventory outside London for the first time in a move aimed at facilitating further expansion.

The $52.5bn SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) has held all its bullion in HSBC’s London vaults since its inception as the first physically backed gold ETF in 2004.

However it is now adding a second custodian JPMorgan utilising the US bank’s vaults in Zurich and New York as well as in London. It is believed to be the first time a gold ETF has had multiple custodians.

“[GLD] was a market innovation in 2004 which put us in a position of being a market leader. It’s now almost 20 years old and we have found a new way to innovate with it” said Joe Cavatoni principal executive officer of World Gold Trust Services the sponsor of the fund.

GLD is a major player in the bullion market accounting for more than 25 per cent of all assets held by gold ETFs. At the peak of the gold rally in July 2020 when prices rocketed to record highs above $2000 a troy ounce the fund’s holdings topped 1200 tonnes making it a bigger owner than the central banks of either Japan or India.

It still holds more than 900 tonnes despite outflows from gold funds as the price has softened to $1800 per troy ounce. JPMorgan and HSBC are the world’s leading bullion banks.

Cavatoni said no client has asked for their assets to be moved out of London or away from HSBC and there were no issues with capacity at HSBC’s vault.

He said the decision to bring JPMorgan on board was not driven by financial considerations. There is no cost impact to investors with custody fees embedded in the 40 basis point annual management fee.

However Cavatoni said from a “risk management perspective we can see some benefits” from increasing the diversification of storage sites.

GLD’s bullion is insured by HSBC but the bank has a standard force majeure clause in place which means it is not responsible for loss caused by terrorist attacks wars or acts of God.

The decision to bring a second custodian on board “is not about something necessarily happening to the gold. The insurance that the industry holds at a vault level is based on what they feel is adequate to cover the likelihood of an event. It’s a factor but it’s not the driving factor” Cavatoni added.

“It gives us the ability to grow to talk to our clients and ensure that we do have in place some diversification away from just a single provider” he said.

“It’s about the fact that we have a vested interest from another vault and another custodian to service the largest gold ETF worldwide. We are excited about this innovation.”

HSBC said it was “pleased to continue acting as a custodian for the World Gold Council’s SPDR Gold Trust”.

JPMorgan alongside HSBC and several other banks already acts as an authorised participant for GLD creating and redeeming blocks of shares in exchange for gold bullion.

This creation and redemption process will continue to operate out of London but WGTS an arm of the World Gold Council will “have the opportunity if we choose to move some of the gold at our discretion” Cavatoni said.

This will not though involve physically trucking gold bars from one location to another he added. Instead the process will be based on book transfers of existing holdings of bullion meaning GLD will end up owning different gold bars.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL2FydGljbGVzL3RoaXMtbmV3LXBheW1lbnRzLXBsYXRmb3JtLW1pZ2h0LXRyYW5zZm9ybS1ob3ctcmVudC1pcy1wYWlkLWZvcmV2ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This New Payments Platform Might Transform How Rent Is Paid Forever,"You can pay for almost anything with digital payments these days except for one big exception that many of us pay every month: rent. While some landlords have modernized their rent payment options 78% still stick to paper checks and money orders according to JPMorgan.

That's why JPMorgan Chase is working on a rent management system called Story. It's currently available in more than 20 states and it has features that can benefit landlords and their tenants.

JPMorgan Chase's new rental payments platform

The main selling point of JPMorgan's Story platform is how it streamlines rent payments through its rent hub. Landlords can use this to send out automatic invoices and payment reminders to their tenants as well as accept online rent payments. Tenants can pay their rent using the following payment methods:

As far as costs are concerned the Story platform is free. Its rent management tool is free for 12 months and there are also no transaction fees for the first 12 months. After that Chase clients who meet minimum balance requirements will continue to have free ACH payments. The full fee structure hasn't been finalized yet.

Story also provides additional tools to help landlords. These include:

Tenant screening: Pull up tenant reports including their credit criminal and eviction history in minutes with TransUnion SmartMove.

Pull up tenant reports including their credit criminal and eviction history in minutes with TransUnion SmartMove. Market metrics: Get access to market data to make decisions about your properties.

Get access to market data to make decisions about your properties. Property calculator: Calculate a property's estimated value.

Calculate a property's estimated value. Affordability calculator: Check if a property qualifies for loan rate discounts through the Chase Affordable Housing Preservation program.

A better way to pay rent

Even though the traditional form of paying rent has stuck around this long it's inefficient and outdated. Any system that requires people to have paper checks on hand or purchase money orders every month clearly needs some work. It's not great for landlords either since they need to sort and deposit all those rent checks. For those with large portfolios that can become quite the time sink.

Digital rent payments are much more convenient for everybody involved. Tenants can pay their rent online in minutes with the payment methods they actually use regularly. Landlords can better keep track of payments from all their properties. They can receive those payments automatically without needing to manually deposit them.

It's also a helpful change for credit card rewards enthusiasts. Lots of credit cards have sign-up bonuses that require you to spend a certain amount. Those requirements can sometimes be difficult to reach. It's much easier to spend enough if you're able to pay rent normally one of the biggest monthly expenses using your credit card.

JPMorgan's Story platform isn't the only game in town. There are several companies that offer payment processing for landlords. However nobody has taken over the market yet. After all most landlords still get paid with checks and money orders. Story could be in a good position to take off in 2023 especially since it's being offered by one of the biggest banks in the world."

Dr Pepper drew scorn for its handling of a college tuition giveaway during halftime of the SEC championship game.

The brand announced one player as the winner based on an obscure rule after they tied twice.

The company eventually decided to give both contestants the $100000 prize money.

Louisiana State University wasn't the only one getting trampled halfway into its SEC championship against Georgia on Saturday — so was Dr Pepper after a controversial ending to its halftime college tuition giveaway contest.

The beverage company drew disdain from the crowd and on social media alike after the annual competition which involves contestants vying for $100000 by throwing footballs into large cans of soda devolved into a confusing tie-breaker.

After the two players — Reagan Whitaker of Baylor University and and Kayla Gibson of the University of St. Augustine — each scored 11 points in the first round they advanced to a second round but tied in that one too. Due to time constraints rather than continuing the face-off Whitaker was deemed the winner based on an obscure rule that counts points from a prior qualifying round.

The decision did not go over well. The crowd erupted into boos and a #JusticeForKayla movement quickly took over social media.

On Twitter several users voiced their frustration with the rule.

Others pointed out how ""depressing"" the contest is.

Dr Pepper appeared to take the outcry to heart. By the fourth quarter CBS reporter Jenny Dell announced the company decided to give both contestants $100000.

""Well you all saw the unprecedented double tie of the Dr Pepper halftime tuition giveaway"" Dell said. ""We 've just been told by Dr Pepper that they're going to award both finalists $100000. So both Kayla Gibson and Reagan Whitaker are taking home $100K. Congratulations ladies and great job by Dr Pepper there.""

Keurig Dr Pepper the brand's parent company has held the contest since 2008 and given away a total of $13 million in college tuition. According to the company this is the first time two finalists have tied twice in a row.

Andrew Springate Chief Marketing Officer for Keurig Dr Pepper said in a statement to Insider that while ""every year there are surprises and unexpected moments"" this year's game ""proved to be one of the most exciting yet with the double tie-breaker.""

The chain was big all over the country because they had everything you could imagine. Buying Christmas lights around the holidays always meant a stop a Frank's with my grandparents -- and it always had a funky smell. The whole company closed up shop in the early 2000s but has recently started an Internet store.

What was the go-kart Whirly Ball place in Flint Michigan?

Whirly Ball was the coolest place when it opened up in the 1990s off Corunna Road. It was almost like playing basketball mixed with hockey and lacrosse in a go kart. Oddly while it's not in the Flint area any longer... it's still around the Detroit Metro. Here's a video of people playing in Flint back in the day.

What happened to The Fair Department Store around Flint Michigan?

The Fair Department store was legendary. I remember going with my family to the Eastland Mall (now Courtland Center) location. It was located in the space JCPenney has now. After The Fair that space became Mervyn's. When Mervyn's went under JCP moved there.

What was the famous Flint-made red pop?

M&S Red Pop was made in Flint MI for a long time. Of course the company had other flavors too. As a kid it seemed better than Faygo -- and that's saying something. M&S stood for 'Mellow & Smooth.' In operation since the early 1900s it ceased operations in 1989. Here's the old plant in Flint MI

The power plant is in Cumberland City Tennessee 45 miles northwest of Nashville.

The current plant generates enough electricity to power 1.1 million homes each year.

TVA is planning to retire all five of its coal-fired plants by 2035.

The Tennessee Valley Authority has selected a combined cycle natural gas power plant to replace the Cumberland coal-fired plant in Cumberland City 45 miles northwest of Nashville. There will be a minimum 30-day period before TVA CEOJeff Lyash makes a final decision on whether to accept the recommendation.

The Cumberland Fossil Plant is TVA's largest coal-fired power plant. The plant generates enough energy to power 1.1 million homes each year. TVA intends to retire the one of the plant's units by 2026 and the second by the end of 2028 as part of its plan to phase out its remaining five coal-fired plants.

TVA evaluated whether to replace the plant with a combined cycle gas plant solar and battery technology a simple cycle gas plant or continuing to burn coal.

TVA's preferred alternative is a combined cycle gas plant that will generate about 1450 megawatts. The plant will require a new 32-mile gas pipeline that will be built from Dickson County to the plant in Stewart County by the Tennessee Gas Pipeline company nationally known as Kinder Morgan.

If Lyash chooses gas the plant's construction would begin in 2023 and should be operational by 2026.

Gas like coal is a fossil fuel and continues to contribute to climate change by releasing carbon dioxide emissions when the fuel is burned as well as methane emissions a more potent greenhouse gas that are released along the supply chain.

TVA's commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 – meaning the utility will release no more carbon dioxide into the environment than it removes – will depend on future technology such as carbon capture small modular nuclear reactors hydrogen fuel and increased investment in solar and battery technology especially if it continues on its path to replace coal plants with natural gas plants.

""Natural gas provides the flexibility needed to reliably integrate renewables. Battery storage technology doesn’t currently provide the output duration needed to support system needs when solar is unavailable. Natural gas is needed to produce power during early morning winter peaks or during overcast or rainy days” Jacinda Woodward senior vice president of TVA Power Operations said on TVA's web page for the Cumberland Environmental Review.

Fighting fossil fuel with fossil fuel: How natural gas is winning TVA's plan to end coal

TVA's push for gas over solar for Cumberland has been met with widespread criticism and questions not only from environmental groups but also from other federal agencies such as the Department of Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency when TVA first released its draft environmental impact statement.

As it continues to retire it's coal plants TVA is set to investigate whether the Kingston coal-fired plant will also be replaced by a natural gas plant. TVA is set to retire the Bull Run coal-fired plant by the end of 2023.

But this year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Clean Water Act presented something different.

The organization wrapped up its annual tradition by highlighting the 12 biggest pollution events in recent Georgia history which were successfully addressed thanks to the passage of the landmark environmental law.

Making a difference

Georgia Water Coalition is a consortium of more than 285 organizations businesses and faith-based groups working together to promote statewide water policy that ensures enough clean water for current and future generations.

""Throughout the state pollution from municipal industrial and agricultural activities pose an ongoing threat to our rivers lakes and wetlands"" said Joe Cook of the Georgia River Network. ""Water pollution continues to have adverse and disproportionate effects on communities of color and low-wealth communities.""

The court cases one of which reached as high as the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Upstate Forever and Savannah Riverkeeper v. Kinder Morgan enforced protections for the environment through stopping or renegotiating development increasing compliance and enforcement as well as addressing sewage sediment and other pollutant sources entering waterways.

For one participant the Clean Water Act was an impetus for lifelong work in conservation.

Inspiring conservation

""When we went to the (Georgia Environmental Protection Division) they said we were the only ones complaining"" according to Linda Smith.

In the 1990s she and her family had seen the beloved waters of the Canoochee River next to their home grow thick with algae and pollution due to runoff from the nearby Claxton Poultry chicken processing facility just upstream.

Complaints hadn't been well recorded by the agency Smith said so she and her sister Sylvia got to work documenting the extent of the pollution.

EPD investigations determined that the poultry plant had been spraying wastewater onto fields which was running into the river.

In 2000 the sisters filed a lawsuit against the company under the Clean Water Act. Part of the settlement was that Claxton Poultry funded for five years a Riverkeeper organization for the Canoochee River which today has evolved to become the Ogeechee Riverkeeper.

""What struck me most about all the cases that are included in the Dirty Dozen report this year is that in most of those cases citizens are the ones that file the complaints or file the lawsuits and get things corrected"" said Cook from Georgia River Network.

He said that citizens are also at the heart of spearheading the response to environmental contamination and should continue to play an important part.

More work to do

While the Clean Water Act has ushered in environmental wins throughout the state there are a slate of new challenges that still need to be addressed.

All of these sources of pollution are occurring amidst an unravelling of wetland protections since the Trump administration.

Rena Peck director of the Georgia River Network said that the Georgia Water Coalition is calling on the state Environmental Protection Division to reject permit applications in order to prevent a mining development on the Okefenokee Swamp.

While the area had previously received federal protections it is now only protected at the state level. They are also seeking legislatures to pass policies protecting North America's largest blackwater swamp permanently.

Sludge:Second round of public comments open for controversial soil amendment regulations

Another area where the redefining and shrinking of wetland protections has come up is with excessive dirt runoff similar to the case U. S. v. Wright Brothers Construction & GDOT. Savannah Riverkeeper Tonya Bonitatibus said her organization has been working on a similar issue near Lake Burton.

""Except this time there's a lot more questions about the streams that are coming in and whether those actually deserve regulation"" Bonitatibus said.

Bonitatibus said another challenge for water conservationists is the lack of regulation of soil amendments industrial waste put on land as an alternative to fertilizer.

Lastly the group also called upon the EPD to require Georgia Power to excavate coal ash — the leftover produced from burning coal — from its unlined ash ponds that are now polluting groundwater and to store in dry-lined ponds.

Looking toward the future the organizations said the Clean Water Act is still a powerful tool to correct pollution in the state. When it comes to fixing these issues Peck Bonitatibus and former longtime EPD employee Bert Langley said one of the largest barriers is EPD funding.

""The EPD has always had to do our best to prioritize the ones that get our biggest bang for the buck"" Langley said.

Watanabe sat down with HoopsHype in Brooklyn’s locker room to open up about his journey to get to this point and rapid rise to notoriety. He discussed the pressure of representing Japan with Rui Hachimura as the only two players from their country and changing the narrative surrounding Asian basketball stereotypes. The Japanese forward also explained how Kevin Durant helped him improve as a shooter his long-term future and more in our interview.

What does it mean to represent Japan with Rui Hachimura as the only two Japanese NBA players?

Patrick Smith-Getty Images

Yuta Watanabe: I think it’s really important for us to represent our country. When I was growing up and I said I wanted to be an NBA player people were like “Only one Japanese guy made it to the league so it’s almost impossible. You can’t do that.” I wanted to change those people’s perceptions. I wanted to change how they thought about themselves and the Japanese. I think more people started watching the NBA. I hope a lot of kids right now are starting to dream of being an NBA player.

If I told you that you’d lead the NBA three-point percentage what would you have said and how have you done it so far?

YW: It’s crazy. I’ve always known I could shoot but 57 percent? That’s impossible. I’m not expecting myself to keep up that number but I’m going to keep shooting with confidence. The reason I’m shooting well is because of KD (Kevin Durant) Ben (Simmons) and Kyrie (Irving). I’m playing with those greats. They get doubled all the time so I’m always open and my job is to make those wide-open shots.

What advice has Kevin Durant given you?

Steph Chambers-Getty Images

YW: He keeps telling me no matter what to keep shooting with confidence. Someone like him telling me to shoot means I better shoot. He gave me a lot of confidence. Every time I make shots he always reacts and is hyped and happy. That’s what keeps me going. I really appreciate his leadership.

On a non-guaranteed contract what has this season done to show that you’re an NBA player and belong here?

YW: Defensively I always thought I was fine in Toronto. There was a time I was getting minutes because of my defense but my offense was a problem. I was so inconsistent with my three-point shot. I knew if I could shoot the ball with confidence and consistency I knew I could get more minutes. That’s what I’ve been doing now. I’m shooting very well now but I can’t forget that I started playing minutes because of my defense energy work ethic and passion.

What’s been the toughest part of your NBA journey so far?

YW: I’ve been through a lot of tough spots. The last four years besides the little bit of time I was playing minutes I was always on the bench and not playing. I’ve been in the G League for the first two years. The first year in Toronto I was on a two-way and the next year I was partially guaranteed. I’ve been non-guaranteed and this year I’m still non-guaranteed. Even though I’m not playing minutes I’ve never taken it for granted. There are a lot of people out there who want to be in the league and it didn’t matter if I’m the 13th 14th or 15th man and I didn’t get minutes. I always went to the gym and worked on my game. When I don’t play I always stand up and cheer for my teammates. If my minutes started going down this season I’m not going to change that. I’m going to be there for my teammates. After the game I’ll just want to go to the gym and work on my game.

Did you ever doubt you’d get to this point given what you’ve gone through?

Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports

YW: Yeah I’m not going to lie. There was a time I thought I might not belong to this league. My family friends teammates and coaching staff always encouraged me to keep my head up. I wouldn’t be here without those people who I’ve met on my journey. I really appreciate everything they’ve done for me.

What’s been the best part of your career to this point?

YW: I’m definitely enjoying this moment right now. Before the injury I was out there playing a lot of minutes and playing in clutch time making shots. I’ve seen my teammates happy and I was making winning plays. I’ve been through tough situations but I know that it was necessary to be here. I’m glad I never gave up.

Have you thought about your future?

YW: I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future but even though my contract could get guaranteed one day or I get a multi-year contract the way I play isn’t going to change. I’ll always play with a high level of intensity and play hard. I always play like this might be my last day in the NBA. I don’t want to take it for granted. This isn’t going to last forever. Non-guaranteed or guaranteed the way I play won’t change.

What goals do you have for your career?

Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports

Watanabe: I don’t have individual goals but I’ve always wanted to win a championship. I know we have that chance here. I know we had a slow start but as you can see we’re getting so much better since the beginning. The chemistry is growing and we’re trusting each other while the communication is getting better. I know we have a chance here. I want to help the Nets win the championship.

The problem has grown to be quite common. While some consumers simply toss out a few complaints and call it a day others have resorted to more drastic legal measures to address their grievances.

Lawsuits against food and beverage companies have gone through the roof in recent years—peaking in 2021 with a total of over 300 class action lawsuits filed. Many of these cases hold a lot of legitimacy addressing issues such as harmful materials found in products untrue sustainability claims or false advertising. No you can't call a product ""100% Natural"" if it's chock full of preservatives and artificial sweeteners.

So yes many of these litigious claims prove to have validity. But there are always a select few that are rather gratuitous and in some cases downright bizarre. We all remember the woman who sued McDonald's for coffee that was ""too hot"" or when Kellogg's faced a lawsuit for its fruitless Froot Loops.

Here are some of the craziest lawsuits brought against food companies in 2022.

5 Grocery Store Trends You'll Start Seeing Everywhere in 2023

The Velveeta Shells & Cheese prep time

Time is certainly a valuable asset—but is a couple extra minutes worth $5 million? According to Florida consumer Amanda Ramirez the answer is yes. Ramirez filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Heinz in November claiming that the company's Velveeta Shells & Cheese takes longer than its advertised 3.5 minutes to make. The lawsuit makes the argument that this allotted time only covers the step of microwaving the product and other actions like opening the package and mixing together water and cheese sauce are not factored in.

In response a Kraft Heinz spokesperson told CNN ""We are aware of this frivolous lawsuit and will strongly defend against the allegations in the complaint.""

The Texas Pete Hot Sauce misnomer

You may recall a lawsuit revolving around Barilla pasta and its non-Italian origins. Well another very similar case popped up around the same time focused on the Texas Pete hot sauce brand.

Contrary to its name the hot sauce is not made in the Lone Star state. It is actually crafted in Winston-Salem N.C.—a fact which California resident Philip White was shocked to learn and which ultimately prompted the class action lawsuit. White says that despite the hot sauces' Texas-style images which include the white star from the state's flag and a cowboy ""there is surprisingly nothing Texas about them"" and he wouldn't have purchased the product if he had known its true origin.

While White appeared to be tricked by the brand's name and appearance the company's website does explain the inception of Texas Pete in detail and clearly states that its actual home is and always has been North Carolina. A quick peek at the product's back label also reveals it is from North Carolina.

The Blue Diamond (Non)Smokehouse Almonds

Accurate wording is everything when it comes to advertisements—a lesson that snack company Blue Diamond was faced with earlier this year. One customer Margo Clark of Chicago was outraged that the company's Smokehouse flavored almonds were in fact not produced in a smokehouse. According to Clark since the almonds are not made through the process of using actual smoke and instead simply include a ""natural hickory smoke flavor"" they are not worthy of the name.

The filing goes on to mention that the almonds' orange and red-colored container is misleading as it is ""evocative of the colors of fire."" And the complaint additionally argues that ""foods that are not made in a smokehouse should contain a prominent statement such as 'with added smoke flavor' 'smoke-flavored' or with 'natural smoke flavor.'"" This is certainly one consumer who is nuts about their nuts!

The catfishing burgers

We've all fallen victim to something (or someone) that looks better in a picture than it does in person. And burgers are no exception. In a lawsuit filed earlier this year New Yorker Justin Chimienti alleged that big burger chains McDonald's and Wendy's misrepresent their products—including popular burgers like The Baconator and the Big Mac—in advertisements.

The claim asserts that these companies photograph their products when the meat is not yet fully cooked making them look up to 15-20% larger than in real life—a tactic which is ""unfair and financially damaging"" according to the plaintiff.

This case followed closely after a similar one against Burger King putting all three of America's top burger chains in hot water this year.

Strawberry-Less Pop-Tarts

Multiple lawsuits have been filed in recent years against Kellogg's Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts and their disheartening lack of real strawberries. Consumers have taken issue with the the fact that the toaster pastries are mostly filled with other fruits—namely apples and pears—which they claim to be inferior to strawberries in terms of health benefits. Although if people are relying on Pop-Tarts for their health value there might be a larger problem here.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

One of these cases filed by Kelvin Brown from New York was officially dismissed in April this year laying the pop-tart fiasco to rest for now. ""No reasonable consumer would see the entire product label reading the words 'Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts' next to a picture of a toaster pastry coated in frosting and reasonably expect that fresh strawberries would be the sole ingredient in the Product"" U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter wrote in the case's ruling according to NPR.

Dunkin's Scalding Hot Coffee

It seems no chain is safe from hot coffee allegations. Alongside McDonald's Dunkin' has faced its fair share of lawsuits with a few taking place just this year.

One filing was from New Jersey couple Evan Arlington and Stephanie Arlington-Macias who say coffee spilled on Arlington's lap while in the drive-thru. The claim alleges that ""as a result thereof plaintiff Evan Arlington has been severely injured has suffered and in the future will suffer great pain and mental anguish."" The lawsuit goes on to say that Arlington's wife ""suffered a loss of her husband's aid comfort conjugal fellowship and consortium"" following the unfortunate event. Ouch!

According to Dan Cox an expert in this field plaintiffs rarely prevail in these types of spillage cases. ""Everyday coffee and tea drinkers consume millions of beverages without incident"" Cox told Insider. ""It only becomes an issue when it is used improperly i.e. spilled.""

Whole Foods' Deceptive Rice Boxes

This isn't the first time a consumer has complained about a disproportionate amount of product compared to packaging and it won't be the last. Chip companies such as Wise Foods have faced legal action for too much air in their chip bags Tootsie Roll Industries was once put under scrutiny for under-filling Junior Mints boxes and in 2022 Whole Foods was scrutinized for empty space in its Everyday 365 Rice Pilaf packaging.

The lawsuit from Leroy Jacobs claimed that the product's box was too big making it look like more rice was included than there was. The case has since been dismissed by U.S. District Judge Elaine E. Bucklo who ruled that ""a reasonable consumer expects the size of the box to bear only a loose relationship to the amount of cooked product its contents will yield.""

The ruling also mentions that accurate serving sizes and labeling did appear on the box and was therefore not misleading.",,,,,,,,,,,,

And although Kroger has several locations approved for that very activity they won’t be in operation on New Year’s Day or even shortly after that.

Downtown Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE: KR) the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets has applied for and received licenses to operate sports betting kiosks at 13 locations in Greater Cincinnati. Those are part of the 42 stores across Ohio where Kroger has received licenses.

Ohio law passed late last year allows legal sports betting to begin Jan. 1. But while many operators are champing at the bit to get started – Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati is launching at 12:01 a.m. that day as part of its New Year’s Eve celebration with Reds legend Pete Rose placing the first bet – Kroger will wait to get its sports betting started.

A Kroger spokesperson told Cincinnati Business Courier its sports betting kiosks likely won't be operational until at least this spring.

Here's how to make your own,"Fans of the much-loved Sanders fudge and caramel toppings haven't been able to find them recently because production was paused a few months ago. The company blames supply chain and production issues.

Shipments to grocery stores and retail outlets have ceased and a quick search on kroger.com shows that the toppings which are popular holiday gift items for Michiganders living in other states are unavailable. The company is looking for a new manufacturing facility. The products are available at the company’s retail locations in Clinton Township and Rochester.

For those who can't make the trip to the store we're here to help. While digging through the Free Press archives we came across a recipe for making the beloved fudge sauce. It's similar to many copycat recipes found on internet searches. The recipe credited to famed recipe detective Gloria Pitzer requires just four ingredients but its creator notes that it's important to use the brand-name products specified.

A second archived recipe we came across calls for adding a few drops of vanilla extract as an option. Both recipes note that the fudge freezes well.

Sanders Fudge Sauce

Makes: 1 quart / Prep time: 40 minutes / Total time: 1 hour plus cooling time

12 ounces Nestle milk chocolate chips

1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter

14 ounces Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk

1 3/4 cup light corn syrup

In the top of a double boiler filled with water set over medium-high heat melt the chocolate chips and butter. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk and corn syrup. This will take about 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook uncovered without stirring for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 15 to 20 minutes. Working in batches place 1 cup of the fudge in a blender on the highest speed for 1 minute. Makes 1 quart. The fudge will keep in the freezer for up to a year.

From the very first snap of the season Christian Academy of Louisville football has been on the hunt. With a high-powered offense and a stout defense CAL looked excellent throughout 14 straight victories. But on Saturday the Centurions finally caught what at one point seemed inconceivable.

CAL capped a perfect season (15-0) by steamrolling Bardstown 38-0 in the KHSAA Class 3A championship game at Kroger Field. The win gave CAL (15-0) its third state championship all-time (2016 2018 2022) and its first since transitioning to Class 3A.

""We told the guys there's not many teams across the state that can really come up short two years in a row and still have an opportunity for a third"" CAL coach Hunter Cantwell said. ""Our guys took advantage of it and came out and made sure what happened the last two years didn't happen again.""

CAL's seniors took this season personally after falling short of the championship two years in a row — maybe nobody more than running back/linebacker Gavin Copenhaver. The senior has been an iron man splitting time on both sides of the ball for CAL all season long. On Saturday the team captain put the team on his back.

""I'm very blessed to be a captain because my teammates see me as being able to lead a team"" Copenhaver said. ""It's a huge role for me and I stepped up.""

It took some time for CAL to get its workhorse going. Bardstown held Copenhaver to 50 yards on eight carries in the first half. After fumbling on the goal line to kick off the second quarter Copenhaver didn't touch the ball again for nearly six minutes.

But Copenhaver provided a kickstart on the first play of the second half with the Centurions holding onto a 14-point lead.

With one handoff right up the gut Copenhaver dashed for a 74-yard touchdown through the heart of Bardstown's defense. Unfortunately for the Tigers Copenhaver's legs were just getting warmed up.

The very next CAL drive Copenhaver took a simple pitch around the right side and raced up the sidelines for a 73-yard touchdown. Copenhaver looked like he was about to settle for a short-yardage gain before realizing his blockers cleared a wide-open hole for him to take advantage of.

""I got to lead the way for him and it was such a great feeling to see him running ahead"" CAL center Noah Hazelip said. ""That's when you know your hard work's paying off.""

Copenhaver's pair of touchdowns pushed CAL's lead to 28-0 and put the Tigers on the ropes. Despite doing more than enough offensively Copenhaver's job wasn't finished. After getting a quick sip of water it was back to defense.

""We have a very well-conditioned football team"" CAL defensive coordinator Pat Riley said. ""They know what they have to accomplish. If [Gavin] rattles one off he knows he's just going to run back on the field on defense and get that accomplished.""

CAL was the first team to shutout Bardstown since Central did so in 2018. After leading the Centurions in rushing and tackles this season Copenhaver will be one of CAL's biggest losses heading next season but he believes that CAL can defend its title.

""I think this is a big thing for us"" Copenhaver said. ""We've got a great coaching staff our receivers are still young We're getting some more players. I think this program can really go far.""

LRCX,Lam Research,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzAzL3doeS1hc21sLWFwcGxpZWQtbWF0ZXJpYWxzLWFuZC1sYW0tcmVzZWFyY2gtcmFsbGllL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why ASML Applied Materials and Lam Research Rallied in November,"It was a good month for semiconductor equipment stocks amid analyst days earnings releases and Warren Buffett buying into the sector.

What happened

Shares of semiconductor equipment stocks ASML Holdings (ASML 1.83%) Applied Materials (AMAT 1.65%) and Lam Research (LRCX 0.87%) rallied in November rising 17.4% 24.1% and 16.7% respectively.

There were several reasons for the across-the-board strength. First semiconductor stocks had already sold off hard this year through September as rising interest rates and recession fears caused a huge decline in semis after they recorded a very strong 2021.

But on Nov. 10 a lighter-than-expected inflation report lit a fire under virtually all beaten-down tech stocks as moderating inflation spurred hope the Fed may slow its interest rate hikes going forward.

In addition ASML held its 2022 Investor Day at which it raised its long-term growth outlook despite a soft market this year. Applied Materials then released its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report which also showed surprising strength despite a softening semi market. Lam Research had already released its third-quarter earnings in late October but rode ASML's and Applied Materials' coattails to above-market gains.

Oh and Warren Buffett also bought into the sector buying the stock of these companies' biggest foundry customer.

So what

At its November Investor Day ASML raised its 2025 outlook about 30% above the figures it had projected as recently as its 2021 Investor Day and guided for continued growth to 2030. The increased long-term guidance is especially reassuring since it appears the semiconductor industry is heading into a downcycle this year.

ASML cited a brighter outlook for artificial intelligence and edge computing data centers as well as the metaverse which just emerged as a big concept a year ago. Furthermore ASML highlighted technology sovereignty such as the passing of the CHIPS Act this past summer as potentially leading to a 10% incremental increase in foundry investments -- and therefore semiconductor machine purchases -- by 2030.

That long-term projection gave a jolt not only to ASML but also to Applied Materials and Lam Research whose etch and deposition machines must be used in conjunction with ASML's lithography machines to produce leading-edge chips.

Applied Materials then followed up ASML's optimism with a better-than-expected earnings report and forecast. There was a lot of hand-wringing coming into Applied's report as the memory industry had gone into a big downturn and new regulations regarding chip sales to China from the Biden administration announced in October had caused Applied to revise down its earnings projections last month.

However when Applied wound up reporting its adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share (EPS) actually came within its original guidance range and well above its October revisions at $2.03 up 5% year over year. And despite the China regulations kicking in for a full quarter Applied guided for $6.7 billion in revenue plus or minus $400 million and EPS between $1.75 and $2.11 for the January quarter -- about flat quarter over quarter.

Given all the headwinds in the semiconductor industry and Applied's history of conservative guidance the flat guidance was enough to satisfy fearful investors that had sold off the stock to bargain-level valuations in October.

Finally all semis likely got a jolt of confidence after Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a large stake in the world's largest foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. TSMC is a huge buyer of ASML Applied and Lam Research machines so a vote of confidence in TSMC is also a vote of confidence in these three companies by association.

Now what

Semiconductor stocks have been known to be cyclical and we seem to be entering some sort of downturn in the second half of 2022. However surprising strength from ASML Applied and even Lam last month could indicate that investment in semiconductor production may be a bit more consistent than the end sales of actual chips themselves.

The full effect of the chip downturn will likely be felt in the first half of next year so these three names are not out of the woods just yet. However if they can get through this downturn without too much of a hit to revenue and earnings there is the chance these three stocks may shed some of their cyclical reputation and garner a higher multiple coming out of this downcycle. Still that has yet to be proven out even after last month's strong numbers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy95dXRhLXdhdGFuYWJlLXRpbWUtdGhvdWdodC1taWdodC0xODAyNDMyODAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yuta Watanabe: 'There was a time I thought I might not belong to this league',"Brooklyn Nets forward Yuta Watanabe began training camp on the roster bubble and improbably became the league’s top three-point shooter at 57.1 percent and is shooting an elite 60.9 percent from the field overall to this point.

Watanabe sat down with HoopsHype in Brooklyn’s locker room to open up about his journey to get to this point and rapid rise to notoriety. He discussed the pressure of representing Japan with Rui Hachimura as the only two players from their country and changing the narrative surrounding Asian basketball stereotypes. The Japanese forward also explained how Kevin Durant helped him improve as a shooter his long-term future and more in our interview.

What does it mean to represent Japan with Rui Hachimura as the only two Japanese NBA players?

Patrick Smith-Getty Images

Yuta Watanabe: I think it’s really important for us to represent our country. When I was growing up and I said I wanted to be an NBA player people were like “Only one Japanese guy made it to the league so it’s almost impossible. You can’t do that.” I wanted to change those people’s perceptions. I wanted to change how they thought about themselves and the Japanese. I think more people started watching the NBA. I hope a lot of kids right now are starting to dream of being an NBA player.

If I told you that you’d lead the NBA three-point percentage what would you have said and how have you done it so far?

YW: It’s crazy. I’ve always known I could shoot but 57 percent? That’s impossible. I’m not expecting myself to keep up that number but I’m going to keep shooting with confidence. The reason I’m shooting well is because of KD (Kevin Durant) Ben (Simmons) and Kyrie (Irving). I’m playing with those greats. They get doubled all the time so I’m always open and my job is to make those wide-open shots.

What advice has Kevin Durant given you?

Steph Chambers-Getty Images

YW: He keeps telling me no matter what to keep shooting with confidence. Someone like him telling me to shoot means I better shoot. He gave me a lot of confidence. Every time I make shots he always reacts and is hyped and happy. That’s what keeps me going. I really appreciate his leadership.

On a non-guaranteed contract what has this season done to show that you’re an NBA player and belong here?

YW: Defensively I always thought I was fine in Toronto. There was a time I was getting minutes because of my defense but my offense was a problem. I was so inconsistent with my three-point shot. I knew if I could shoot the ball with confidence and consistency I knew I could get more minutes. That’s what I’ve been doing now. I’m shooting very well now but I can’t forget that I started playing minutes because of my defense energy work ethic and passion.

What’s been the toughest part of your NBA journey so far?

YW: I’ve been through a lot of tough spots. The last four years besides the little bit of time I was playing minutes I was always on the bench and not playing. I’ve been in the G League for the first two years. The first year in Toronto I was on a two-way and the next year I was partially guaranteed. I’ve been non-guaranteed and this year I’m still non-guaranteed. Even though I’m not playing minutes I’ve never taken it for granted. There are a lot of people out there who want to be in the league and it didn’t matter if I’m the 13th 14th or 15th man and I didn’t get minutes. I always went to the gym and worked on my game. When I don’t play I always stand up and cheer for my teammates. If my minutes started going down this season I’m not going to change that. I’m going to be there for my teammates. After the game I’ll just want to go to the gym and work on my game.

Did you ever doubt you’d get to this point given what you’ve gone through?

Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports

YW: Yeah I’m not going to lie. There was a time I thought I might not belong to this league. My family friends teammates and coaching staff always encouraged me to keep my head up. I wouldn’t be here without those people who I’ve met on my journey. I really appreciate everything they’ve done for me.

What’s been the best part of your career to this point?

YW: I’m definitely enjoying this moment right now. Before the injury I was out there playing a lot of minutes and playing in clutch time making shots. I’ve seen my teammates happy and I was making winning plays. I’ve been through tough situations but I know that it was necessary to be here. I’m glad I never gave up.

Have you thought about your future?

YW: I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future but even though my contract could get guaranteed one day or I get a multi-year contract the way I play isn’t going to change. I’ll always play with a high level of intensity and play hard. I always play like this might be my last day in the NBA. I don’t want to take it for granted. This isn’t going to last forever. Non-guaranteed or guaranteed the way I play won’t change.

What goals do you have for your career?

Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports

Watanabe: I don’t have individual goals but I’ve always wanted to win a championship. I know we have that chance here. I know we had a slow start but as you can see we’re getting so much better since the beginning. The chemistry is growing and we’re trusting each other while the communication is getting better. I know we have a chance here. I want to help the Nets win the championship.

Steven Cutler points to one of the seemingly countless artifacts from Las Vegas’ colorful past adorning the walls of his home office and starts telling a story.

His collection of 500000 pieces — his rough estimate — is a walking history of vintage Las Vegas.

There’s an ashtray from the old Moulin Rouge hotel a signed photo from Liberace and numerous classic casino chips from the Flamingo Caesars Palace Stardust and other casinos.

Cutler picks up a gaming chip from his collection — this one from the old California Club — and starts reminiscing.

“This is a $30000 chip; this is a great chip” Cutler said. “That’s not the California Hotel that you might be thinking of this is from the California Club which opened on Fremont Street in the 1950s. There are three known chips like this that exist in the world.”

Cutler said his “holy grail” of chips is a set from the old Sahara worth about $100000. The set contains chips of $20 $50 $100 $500 and $1000 denominations. It’s unique Cutler said because the sets were sequential and his is numbered “0001.”

Cutler once received an offer of $20000 for the set but said he “laughed it off.”

“There’s nothing else like this in the world” Cutler said. “I have crazy things things nobody should own. I have entertainer contracts paychecks china sets swizzle sticks … everything.”

Much of the collection is kept at a warehouse. A lot of pieces once made up the old Casino Legends Hall of Fame which was an attraction at the Tropicana that closed in 2005. Cutler also had small attractions at different times in Reno and Laughlin.

Cutler said he’s been in contact with officials at museums and resorts to host some of his items but stressed he’s not in the business of just donating his items.

“For 15 years I tried to reestablish the Casino Legends Hall of Fame” Cutler said. “Everybody told me that they loved it and that it was really cool but …”

Cutler’s voice trailed off as he contemplated whether there could be a future for a rebirthed hall of fame.

“If somebody was smart they’d buy everything that I own and just do it” Cutler said. “I’m not going to be around in a year or two. I’m dying. Everything I own is for sale to be very honest and blunt.”

Cutler went on to explain that he has cancer of the throat tongue and lymph nodes. At 71 he’s facing his own mortality.

“I just finished having six rounds of (chemotherapy) and 30 rounds of radiation” he said. “I’m not sure it did any good.”

As he continued to talk about his vintage items Cutler didn’t sound like a man close to his last days. Instead he had a twinkle in his eye and often a smile on his face as he displayed his fondness for a period in Las Vegas that he called “glamorous” and “authentic.”

The collection also includes dice from the old Apache Club inside the Apache Hotel original copies of Las Vegas Age newspapers from the 1930s numerous casino security badges and casino chips melted from the 1980 MGM Grand fire or recovered from Lake Tahoe.

Whenever a resort has a change in ownership or rebrand that requires a new design in the property’s gaming chips operators are legally required to post notice that existing chips would only hold any value for a certain amount oftime. The leftover chips are then destroyed. As is the case with items that become collectible only so many remain which render many of them valuable.

In September Cutler had some of his items at a casino collectibles show at the Gold Coast.

“Everything I’m selling is being deeply discounted” Cutler said.

Cutler’s hope is that most of his collection is bought up. He’d love for there to be a Casino Legends Hall of Fame 2.0.

“Mr. Cutler has a really impressive collection” said Michal Green a Las Vegas historian and UNLV professor who is on the Mob Museum’s board of directors. “He’s like a lot of people out there in that he has some stuff that should probably be in a museum. He and people like him I think need to make sure they talk to museums and people who can evaluate their items and preserve for others.”

Casino operators are primarily concerned with profit margins — and space inside a casino is quite valuable — but Green said he thinks it’s possible that “the right kind of casino operator” in Las Vegas could have use for some type of casino hall of fame attraction.

“It could work” Green said. “To have maybe a small space that could potentially attract people that could be a good thing for a casino operator. With the Mob Museum the city has supported that endeavor but the museum has helped them too. There are people who come to the museum then partake in what’s near it.”

As a historian Green said he believes artifacts should always be kept in the best possible environment so as to make sure the pieces will live on as long as possible. As far as having an eye for what’s collectible Cutler said there are few in his category when it comes to vintage casino pieces.

In fact when casino mogul Steve Wynn bought the Desert Inn a little over 20 years ago — it was eventually razed to make room for the Wynn and Encore properties — he called Cutler to come by and evaluate some old items.

“He wanted me to go through all this stuff and tell him what was valuable and what wasn’t” Cutler said. “A lot of stuff I knew wasn’t valuable so it just went into the trash. Anything else if there was a duplicate I was free to take one for the hall of fame.

Cutler’s all-time favorite Las Vegas entertainer is Liberace though he said Sammy Davis Jr. is a close second.

“Las Vegas has such a colorful history” Cutler said. “There’s nothing more sexy than vintage Vegas in the 1950s or the 1960s. It was so different back then. I also think about Frank Sinatra. There have been some horrible stories about him and he did some bad things but he was a great guy. He did a lot for this city which unfortunately people don’t talk about enough.”

And Cutler could talk for days about the Las Vegas of yesterday. He said one Sinatra story stands out.

“There was a lot of racism in this city back in the old days” Cutler said. “(Sinatra) told Jack Entratter who was entertainer director at the Sands back then that if they weren’t going to let Sammy Davis stay at the hotel he’d be done with them. They ended up changing that rule.”

As Cutler wound down his artifact tour and trip down memory lane he said he doesn’t want anyone to feel sorry for him.

“I had a great run” Cutler said. “I can’t complain but it is a shame that the hall of fame doesn’t exist anymore. I hope I get a call from someone who wants to do something with all this stuff.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Austin-based 3D home printing company Icon won a $57.2 million contract with NASA to develop technology to help build lunar infrastructure like roads landing pads and habitats according to a press release.

The contract runs through 2028 and expands upon other Icon partnerships with the federal government to develop the company’s Olympus construction system. To avoid importing building supplies from Earth Olympus is designed to use construction materials on the moon and Mars.

“In order to explore other worlds we need innovative new technologies to those environments and our exploration needs” Niki Werkheiser director of technology maturation in NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate said in a statement.

Icon’s other work with NASA includes Mars Dune Alpha a 1700-square-foot 3D-printed Martian habitat that will be employed in the space administration’s Crew Health and Performance Analog mission next year.

The construction technology startup raised $185 million in a funding round that closed in February bringing its total funding to $451 million. An anonymous source told TechCrunch at the time of the funding round the company was estimated to be worth $2 billion.

Icon debuted America’s first permitted 3D-printed home in 2018 just one year after the company was founded. Last October it announced a partnership with homebuilding giant Lennar to develop a community of 100 3D-printed homes in Austin. The first home in the project debuted in March featuring the 2000-square-foot “House Zero” and a 350-square-foot guest house which took just eight days to build with the firm’s Vulcan technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fans of Taylor Swift will file a lawsuit against Ticketmaster over its chaotic ticket rollout for her upcoming tour.

Deadline and TMZ reported on Saturday that more than 20 Swifties took legal action against Ticketmaster which is owned by Live Nation Entertainment. The lawsuit was obtained and shared by Deadline.

The lawsuit accused Ticketmaster of ""fraud price-fixing and antitrust violations."" The lawsuit also accused Ticketmaster of ""intentional deception"" that allowed scalpers and bots to snag the majority of tickets for ""The Eras"" tour.

""For years scalpers have been a problem in the secondary market. Ticketmaster has stated that it has taken steps to address the issue but in reality has taken steps to make additional profit from the scalped tickets"" the lawsuit reads.

The lawsuit alleged that Ticketmaster controls the primary ticket sales market and part if not all of the secondary market.

""Ticketmaster claimed that only those with codes would be able to join the presale but millions of buyers without codes were able to get tickets"" the lawsuit reads. ""Many of those without codes were scalpers and Ticketmaster benefited from scalped tickets as they must be resold on Ticketmaster who gets an additional fee.""

The lawsuit alleged that even if Ticketmaster hadn't intentionally colluded about the ticket sale they were unprepared for the demand. The plaintiffs have requested Ticketmaster face a fine of $2500 per violation.

Representatives for Ticketmaster did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

In November Swifties blasted Ticketmaster after encountering long lines and system outages while attempting to buy tickets for Swift's tour. Ticketmaster later canceled ticket sales citing ""extraordinarily high demands"" and ""insufficient remaining ticket inventory."" Ticketmaster said in a statement that Swift sold 2 million tickets at that time.

Swift called out Ticketmaster on her Instagram Stories following the online backlash saying the situation ""really pisses me off.""

""I'm not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them multiple times if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could"" Swift wrote. ""It really pisses me off that a lot of them feel like they went through several bear attacks to get them.""

Ticketmaster issued an official apology to Swift and her fans soon after.

However Ticketmaster is still dealing with the fallout. On November 30 a group of Swifties demanded that the Federal Trade Commission investigate Ticketmaster for ""predatory"" and ""misleading"" tactics.

Many fans complained of hours-long waits error messages and exorbitant resale prices while trying to purchase tickets on Nov. 15 for Swift's Eras tour.

Ticketmaster blamed its website's meltdown on overwhelming demand and postponed general sales for Swift's tour while it shores up its platform.

In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles a group of 26 Swift fans accuses Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation Entertainment of intentional misrepresentation fraud price fixing and antitrust violations among other unlawful practices over the bungled pre-sale. The lawsuit was first reported by TMZ.

The plaintiffs allege Ticketmaster ""intentionally and purposefully misled"" purchasers about the availability of tickets allowed scalpers and bots to buy tickets and ""was eager"" to allow resales that would bring in extra fees.

""Ticketmaster is a monopoly that is only interested in taking every dollar it can from a captive public"" the lawsuit says.

The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and ask that the company be fined $2500 US ($3367 Cdn) for each violation if it is found guilty.

CBC News has reached out to Ticketmaster and Live Nation for comment.

Calls to break up Ticketmaster's power

Ticketmaster has previously said it tried to limit demand for Swift's pre-sale while simultaneously preventing scalping by requiring fans to register for verification and only sending pre-sale codes to about 40 per cent of those ""verified"" accounts.

But a ""staggering number"" of bots — used by scalpers to quickly snap up tickets that can be resold at inflated prices — as well as fans without pre-sale codes overloaded its website the company said in an explanatory post last month.

In a statement on Instagram three days after the ticket fiasco Swift also blamed Ticketmaster writing: ""We asked them multiple times if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could.""

Music industry experts recently told CBC News that Swift and her team would have approved some of the measures that fans objected to including how many tickets were available for pre-sales and allowing tickets to be resold.

Ticketmaster is also facing scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and regulators as well as renewed calls to break it apart from Live Nation which it merged with in 2010.

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar who chairs a subcommittee on competition and consumer rights has promised a hearing ""to examine the lack of competition in the ticketing industry"" while the Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation the New York Times reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hbmdyeS10YXlsb3Itc3dpZnQtZmFucy1hcmUtc3VpbmctdGlja2V0bWFzdGVyLWFmdGVyLXRoZS1ib3RjaGVkLWVyYXMtdG91ci10aWNrZXQtbGF1bmNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Angry Taylor Swift fans are suing Ticketmaster after the botched Eras Tour ticket launch,"After an epic fail of a ticket rollout that drew a rebuke from Taylor Swift herself almost two dozen of the singer’s fans have decided to file a lawsuit against Ticketmaster following its handling of Swift’s The Eras tour presale.

More than 20 Swifties are suing Ticketmaster which is owned by Live Nation Entertainment for a variety of charges including “fraud price-fixing and antitrust violations.” Moreover the suit goes on to allege “intentional deception” on the part of the ticketing giant that allowed bots and scalpers to snatch up tickets that many of Swift’s fans waited hours to try and buy during the presale — only to face problems including the website not working properly sales not completing and much more.

Swifties sue Ticketmaster

For example “Ticketmaster claimed that only those with codes would be able to join the presale but millions of buyers without codes were able to get tickets” the lawsuit reads. “Many of those without codes were scalpers and Ticketmaster benefited from scalped tickets as they must be resold on Ticketmaster who gets an additional fee.”

What happened: As a reminder all of this stems from Ticketmaster’s launch last month of a Verified Fans presale for Swift’s forthcoming “Eras” tour — her first in years and for which demand was unsurprisingly off the charts.

Ticketmaster while noting in an apologetic statement that it did manage to sell 2 million tickets on the launch day nevertheless was not prepared for the overwhelming demand. Its systems struggled to keep up for example and frequently greeted customers with outages and long wait times. For unexplained reasons customers sometimes weren’t able to complete their sales at all.

‘Really pisses me off’

The debacle was another black eye for one of the most hated companies in the US and even drew condemnation not only from Swift — who seethed in a statement via her Instagram account that the situation “really pisses me off” — but also from New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and White House chief of staff Ron Klain.

AOC for example tweeted the following: “Daily reminder that Ticketmaster is a monopoly.” Moreover she continued its merger with event promoter Live Nation “never should have been approved … Break them up.”

In an interview with CNBC the CEO of Ticketmaster’s largest shareholder (Liberty Media’s Greg Maffei) seemed to blame believe it or not Taylor herself for all of this.

“Reality is it’s a function of the massive demand that Taylor Swift has” Maffei said. “The site was supposed to be opened up for 1.5 million verified Taylor Swift fans. We had 14 million people hit the site — including bots another story which are not supposed to be there. And despite all the challenges and the breakdowns we did sell over 2 million tickets that day. We could have filled 900 stadiums.”

Bottom line: I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Ticketmaster is a company of rapacious suit-wearing vampires who’ve systematically turned the live concert industry into a shady and universally despised cabal. Ticketmaster has one job to do. And yet the company keeps trotting out the same old tired excuse when it can’t perform that job satisfactorily — Too many people! We had no idea! So much demand!

Watch NASA's Artemis 1 Launch Abort System blast off into space (video),"Rage against the dying of the light in this new video.

NASA's Orion spacecraft cockpit shines in pink from the glow of its Launch Abort System (LAS) tower ripping away from the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and spacecraft stack. This all happened as planned during the epic launch of the Artemis 1 mission to the moon Nov. 16.

The movie-like moment which looks like a scene from ""Interstellar"" or ""Star Wars"" shows the LAS flying away from the cockpit within sight of a mannequin astronaut that is testing out radiation and other space hazards before humans climb on board.

Lockheed Martin which built the Orion spacecraft shared the cockpit view on Twitter on Friday (Dec. 1) anticipating what astronauts will see with their own eyes starting with Artemis 2's expected journey around the moon in 2024. Lunar landing mission Artemis 3 will follow as soon as 2025 with more Artemis program missions in the works.

The SLS Launch Abort System generates enough thrust to lift 26 elephants off the ground according to NASA statistics. That's more power than what is available to five F-22 jets.

NASA's version of 'The Force' is needed to pull astronauts away from the SLS rocket swiftly and safely in case of emergency. If the launch brings the crew to space without incident however the LAS tower tears away into space to reduce the mass of the capsule before its trip to the moon.

Epic video from throughout Artemis 1 has kept the public riding along with the spacecraft around the moon and towards Earth again bringing amazing live views of the lunar surface and our distant planet that left NASA engineers ""giddy"" with joy.

Orion is expected to splash down Dec. 11 after following in the footsteps of generations of missions featuring their own abort systems.

Most space systems with humans on board have been fitted with ejection seats or launch abort towers through crewed history with the exception of latter missions of the space shuttle that instead had mission abort options with the crew remaining inside the vehicle.

Perhaps the most dramatic use of a real-life abort using a launch escape tower was the Soviet Union's Soyuz T-10-1 launch on Sept. 26 1983. Russian space journalist Anatoly Zak says the system saved the lives of the launching crew as it pulled them away from an exploding rocket still on the launch pad.

The latest crewed abort on Oct. 11 2018 during Soyuz mission MS-10 to the International Space Station did not use the escape tower as that had been already jettisoned but the crew used an alternate abort mode to make it back to ground swiftly and safely. (You can listen in to the abort as it happened in the video above.)

Private space providers have their own escape systems on their rockets as was demonstrated during a dramatic Blue Origin uncrewed launch failure of the New Shepard system on Sept. 12 2022. The emergency escape system pulled the capsule safely away from the booster which was presumably destroyed during launch. Blue Origin is investigating the cause and plans to launch people to space again no earlier than 2023 after having conducted six crewed missions with no incident.

Berlin announced in March it would buy 35 of the warplanes made by Lockheed Martin to replace its ageing Tornado fleet in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

But the defense ministry has raised concerns about “delays and additional costs” in the nearly 10 billion euro ($10.5 billion) purchase according to a classified letter to parliament’s budget committee.

Risk factors range from upgrading work needed at air fields that will host the F-35s to security requirements and potential problems with approval for flight operations in Germany it said.

A defense ministry spokesman said there would “close cooperation” and “clarification” of issues with parliament.

There will be an emergency meeting Monday at the defense ministry which will be attended by budget committee members from the three parties in Germany’s ruling coalition parliamentary sources told AFP.

The committee is supposed to release the first tranche of funds for the project on December 14.

The document seen by AFP was prepared by the finance ministry for the committee and was based on assessments from the defense ministry.

According to the document it is doubtful whether the necessary upgrades to Buechel air base which will host the jets can be completed by 2026 when delivery is set to begin.

The current timeframe is “highly ambitious” it said. In addition the security requirements from the US side are complex which could lead to further delays and cost increases it said.

There is a also a danger that approvals for flight operations for the F-35s in Germany cannot be secured on time as necessary documents are not available it said.

This would mean that flights could only be operated with restrictions said the document.

It pointed to other factors that could lead to cost increases including inflation fluctuations in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro and rising production costs.

The cost of the jets is to come from a planned 100 billion euro investment in the armed forces unveiled following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in a bid to overhaul Germany’s underfunded military.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz said last week that he wants the contract for the F-35s considered the world’s most modern combat aircraft finalized by the end of this year."

At 32 Sam Lowes experienced the worst season of his career in 2022 scoring only 55 points while only being 19th in the championship at the time of counting. The fault was an injury contracted during a free session of his national Grand Prix at Silverstone injuring a shoulder which never really recovered. The Marc VDS driver was forced to withdraw from numerous races including the last two at Sepang and Valencia which he hoped would be positive tests to look forward to 2023 with serenity. This was not the case so he went to Jerez to test with the Superbikes…

It is a real commando operation carried out Sam Lowes by joining Jerez with a mechanic and a member of a Marc VDS team who remains faithful to him despite the challenges and the passage of time. The former Supersport World Champion has in a way returned to his first love by bringing with him an R6 and an R1. Of the Yamaha which allowed him to evaluate this dislocated shoulder which is causing him so much worry and pain.

On his expedition to Spain he declared on speedweek : "" it was nice to finally be able to ride a motorcycle again. I was unable to participate in the Sepang and Valencia races and even suffered from my shoulder injury during the previous rounds of the World Championship. In the meantime I have strengthened my shoulder muscles again. It was nice to finally be able to ride again without pain and have fun ».

Sam Lowes: “ I can now approach the winter break with a smile instead of uncertainty and lack of performance«

He adds : "" I did 72 or 73 laps. It was good now I can see the condition of my shoulder. I now know what work I still have to do in winter. I can now approach the winter break with a smile instead of uncertainty and lack of performance. The weather was a little against us on Thursday but we were able to do a lot of laps on Friday "". And he ends: “ I haven't done so many laps in a day in a long time. It was a really productive test. Now I can't wait to be in top shape again this winter ».

We will recall that Sam Lowes has been with Marc VDS since 2020 a structure for which he will ride for a fourth season in 2023 and the second with Tony Arbolino by his side. The Italian managed by Charles Pernat experienced another scenario in 2022 with three victories which allowed him to climb to a solid fourth place in the World Championship."

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFsY29sbS1hdy1jYW5jZWxlZC0xMDBtLW5lb20tY29udHJhY3QtaHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLWFidXNlLXNhdWRpLTIwMjQtNdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFsY29sbS1hdy1jYW5jZWxlZC0xMDBtLW5lb20tY29udHJhY3QtaHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLWFidXNlLXNhdWRpLTIwMjQtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CEO canceled $100M Neom contract after Saudis bulldozed villages,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.businessinsider.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /malcolm-aw-canceled-100m-neom-contract-human-rights-abuse-saudi-2024-5 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C48FF2E530>, 'Connection to www.businessinsider.com timed out.

Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from 20th Century Studios the first Apes release under the Disney empire is looking at $21M-$22M today (which includes previews) for a what is looking like a $52M-$55M opening at 4075 theaters. Tracking saw it around $50M.

Also the opening is in the vicinity of the first and third chapter of the previous millennium trilogy: 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M Friday $54.8M 3-day) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M Friday $56.2M 3-day). RT Audience sentiment is still at 82%.

The rest of the top five is as follows:

2.) Fall Guy (Uni) 4008 theaters Fri $3.6M 3-day $14.5M -48% Total $50.5M/Wk 2

3.) Challengers (AMZ) 2609 theaters Fri $1.55M 3-day $5M -34% Total $38.3M/Wk 3

4.) Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Fri $1M 3-day $3.4M -48% Total $12M/Wk 2

5.) Godzilla x Kong (WB/Leg) 2531 theaters Fri $700K 3-day $3M -34% Total $192.3M/Wk 7

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzEwL2dvcmRvbi1yYW1zYXlzLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtZW1waXJlLXRyaXBsZWQtbG9zc2VzLXRvLTM0bS1sYXN0LXllYXLSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8xMC9nb3Jkb24tcmFtc2F5cy1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWVtcGlyZS10cmlwbGVkLWxvc3Nlcy10by0zNG0tbGFzdC15ZWFy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant empire tripled losses to £3.4m last year,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.theguardian.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /business/article/2024/may/10/gordon-ramsays-restaurant-empire-tripled-losses-to-34m-last-year (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C48FF2D7E0>, 'Connection to www.theguardian.com timed out.

Located on the main road next to Mumbai’s Cotton Green railway station the hotel rooms are priced around ₹2000. He had booked this hotel through Oyo Hotels and Homes the India subsidiary of Oravel Stays Limited. Over the last many years this hospitality startup founded by Ritesh Agarwal has changed the way unbranded hotels are aggregated and marketed—life is far easier for couples and business travellers on a budget.

“What brings you here?"" the hotel manager asked the customer.

“A trade fair"".

“We will accept only cash"" the manager told the guest.

In fact all visitors to the hotel can see a notice pasted on the reception wall on two A4-sized papers. “Dear customer"" the notice sandwiched between a wall clock and a ‘No Smoking’ sign read. “We are not accepting any pre-paid bookings of Oyo due to non-payment of amounts by Oyo. We accept ‘only pay at hotel’"".

The hotel’s owner Vishamber Shewakramani had signed up with Oyo for a five-year lock-in contract with a minimum guarantee in 2019. This meant that the hotel could make a minimum revenue irrespective of occupancy. Oyo made such agreements with thousands of hotels. All went well till the pandemic struck—people stopped both business and leisure travel. The hospitality industry including hotels and restaurants went into a downward spiral. They faced high fixed costs but had no business for many months.

Oyo terminated the minimum guarantee contracts in 2020 invoking the force majeure clause—one that removes liability for unforeseeable catastrophes. But hundreds of hoteliers from across the country filed claims running over ₹220 crore against Oyo for breach of contract and unpaid dues.

Oravel Stays Ltd is now headed for an initial public offering (IPO). The company is therefore keen on cleaning up its act. It has been trying to settle disputes with hoteliers selectively through arbitration. For instance in July 2021 it arrived at an out-of-court settlement with Rakesh Yadav a hotelier who had filed a case against Oyo at the National Company Law Tribunal for ₹16 lakh in unpaid dues. According to one person familiar with the cases Oyo has settled cases with 50-60% of the hotel partners who filed claims.

Settling such disputes is an imperative for Oyo considering that industry bodies such as the Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) have been lobbying to stop Oyo from launching the IPO. Recently the federation wrote to the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) alleging that “Oyo is responsible for the systemic depredation of the budget segment hotel business"".

“Disagreements or litigations with patrons constitute less than 0.25% of our 170000 storefronts (hotels and homes) globally. A lot of these originated during the tumultuous covid period. We have been working hard to settle these through mediation arbitration etc. and have seen steady progress. In most such cases the patrons have started working with us again"" an Oyo spokesperson told Mint.

Hoteliers were offered different amounts as settlement two hoteliers said asking not to be named because of confidentiality agreements. One hotelier said he was offered 10% of the claim amount. A second hotelier said Oyo paid up to 40%. Oyo did not comment on the range that it has offered to hotels as settlement.

Indeed Oyo has settled with Shewakramani too. But now he has another grouse. He is upset with the way Oyo prices rooms—below a ‘floor price’ or the lower limit for a hotel room. This in short is Oyo’s next challenge to overcome.

Revenue vs price

Oyo frequently compares itself to Marriott International the multinational hospitality giant with 30 brands and over 8000 properties in 139 countries. And while Oyo brands itself as the ‘world’s leading chain of hotels and homes’ the startup is not strictly an operator. Oyo provides a platform to onboard partner hotels rebrand them drive sales and manage bookings and revenue. It also provides tech consumer support.

Post the covid fiasco Oyo shifted focus to revenue share arrangements instead of the minimum guarantee contract.

In May this year Shewakramani entered into a one-year marketing and operating consulting agreement contract with Oyo for Rajdoot Hotel. Under such contracts Oyo charges a commission—between 20% and 35%—for marketing the rooms. For hotels that are in prime locations and are easy to discover the commissions charged are usually less. The company’s artificial intelligence (AI) engine prices the rooms in a way that ensures volumes. Besides this commission Oyo also charges for other value-added services.

“They are able to push customers to us because they are giving away our rooms at any price"" Shewakramani complained.

While his hotel occupancy has increased because of the discounting the total amount of sales booked has not increased substantially. “This has hit our profitability as the increase in occupancy adds to the cost"" the hotelier said.

Other hoteliers too have similar complaints—they have little control over how they price their room inventory once they sign the marketing contract.

The Oyo spokesperson clarified that the company encourages hotels to look at the total revenue it is able to drive instead of just looking at the floor price. A hotel can attract a much larger customer pool through what is known as ‘dynamic pricing’. Often used in sectors such as aviation this strategy allows a company to quickly adjust fares in response to demand or market conditions.

“The agreement with hotels doesn’t have any ‘floor price’ commitment. Since we have a revenue sharing arrangement it’s in both the hotels’ and Oyo’s interest to charge the fair amount a customer feels justified to pay"" the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added that with every passing month more and more hoteliers are “reverting back to the higher total revenue mindset"".

But some hoteliers Mint spoke to weren’t sure just yet. “The whole agreement with Oyo must change. It is too one-sided. We will treat them (Oyo) as any other online travel aggregator sending traffic to us. They will be the same as a Booking.com or a Goibibo or a Makemytrip for us"" a hotelier who didn’t want to be identified said.

The cost imperative

Oyo meanwhile is cleaning up its books. It is finding ways to cut costs while improving margins.

On 3 December the company said it was terminating 600 employees in technology roles and hiring 250 in sales and for managing hotel relationships.

Oyo reported a gross profit margin of 41% in the first half of 2022-23 up from 9% in 2019-20 the company disclosed in a 28 November filing with Sebi. A significant portion of its fixed costs fell when it ended the minimum guarantee contracts. This is why Oyo reported higher margins over the last two years a person in the know who didn’t want to be identified said.

Overall Oyo’s losses narrowed to ₹747 crore in the first half of 2022-23 from ₹801 crore in the year-ago period. On a full year basis the company’s losses narrowed to ₹1940 crore in 2021-22 from ₹3945 crore the year before.

The expectation is that its employee stock ownership plan (esop) expenses will reduce over the next two years which will reduce its losses. Also one of the objectives of the IPO is to retire loans which will take care of the interest payments thus improving profitability.

According to the Oyo’s draft red herring prospectus filed on 1 October 2021 it earmarked ₹2441 crore for prepayment or repayment of “certain borrowings"". Another ₹2900 crore was earmarked for funding the company’s organic and inorganic growth initiatives.

A Fitch Ratings report in June assigned a B- rating (down from B) on Oyo’s $660 million senior secured term loan facility that was raised in 2021. It is due in 2026. The Fitch report states that it expects “Oyo will likely achieve meaningful EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) profit only in FY24"" compared to its previous expectation of 2022-23.

Revenues of the future

Oyo’s revenues more than halved between 2019-20 and 2021-22 underlining the impact of the pandemic on the hospitality industry (see chart). The first half of this year has been encouraging but the company has quite some distance to go before it can catch up with its pre-covid revenues of ₹13168 crore in 2019-20.

Where will its future revenues come from?

The hotels business in India still generates the bulk of its revenue and this is where Oyo wants to invest further and rope in new partners. Overseas it has identified Indonesia Malaysia and the homes business in Europe as areas of growth.

Some venture capitalists meanwhile remain hopeful—the company is in a good space they say.

“Tough to comment on how it will do for investors but there is a business here. And if there is enough time it will be a meaningful one"" Anand Lunia co-founder of venture capital firm India Quotient said in November.

In an article in 2018 Lunia referred to Oyo as one of the firm’s ‘anti-portfolio companies’—a phrase used by VCs to characterize companies they missed investing in for various reasons. A few years back when India Quotient had an opportunity to invest it stayed away. One of the concerns was founder Ritesh Agarwal’s ability to execute he said at the time.

“Yes everyone can be better. But let’s not forget how life was before Oyo"" Lunia said. “Oyo helped set a minimum bar one could expect from a budget hotel room. As consumers got used to good air-conditioners and mattresses in their own homes the low-end hotels did not keep up. Oyo created this whole category where hotels had to up their game. In cities it solved the need for couples’ privacy and predictability for tourists"" Lunia added.

But Oyo’s use cases today have shot far beyond what Lunia mentions. People book rooms through Oyo because they are getting their houses painted; some want to watch football matches in groups; many stay to avoid intra-city overnight travel. Students looking to take examinations in smaller cities and sports tournaments also contribute to spikes in customer bookings. Business travel is an important segment too with the Oyo platform being used by many small and medium enterprises startups and travel management companies.

Resizing expectations

While the rebound in the hospitality business this year is good news Oyo has challenges to overcome on the valuation front as well. How will it price its IPO given the year-long tech rout?

When the company first filed its draft papers in October 2021 it expected a $12 billion valuation. This appears bloated right now.

In November a report in The Economic Times stated that the Nomura-Mizuho consortium wrote down $850 million of a $2.2 billion loan it had lent to founder Ritesh Agarwal. About $1.8 billion of this loan was linked to the company’s valuation—$9.7 billion in 2019.

Agarwal had taken the loan via RA Hospitality a vehicle used to buy back shares owned by Sequoia Capital Lightspeed and some other investors. Agarwal and RA Hospitality together own around 31% stake in Oyo. With the write-off the valuation today would fall to $5.8 billion.

Then a Bloomberg report in September stated that investor Softbank which owns 46% stake in Oyo cut the value of its stake. The Japanese investor also valued the company at around $5.8 billion.

Considering that Oyo has shrunk in revenues since 2019-20 it cannot expect to command a multiple that hyper growth startups do market watchers said. “There is an expectation that the company’s valuation might improve after its Q2 results"" a person familiar with the company’s strategy said adding that Oyo is currently trading at a valuation of $6.5 billion in the grey market.

Oyo declined to comment on its expected IPO pricing and did not make its founder Agarwal available for an interview. Nonetheless multiple people watching Oyo said that it needs to hurry up on its clean-up act. Investors are watching its path to profitability rather closely—there is little appetite either in the private or the public markets to fund loss-making companies.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will participate in a pilot test of a digital dollar to counter the challenge posed by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin by evaluating the rollout of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Citi HSBC Mastercard and Wells Fargo are among financial companies collaborating with the New York Fed’s Innovation Center in a 12-week proof-of-concept pilot using digital dollar tokens in a shared database to speed cross-border settlement in currency markets. The test will take place on a digital money platform known as the regulated liability network (RLN) using distributed ledger technology.

As part of the evaluation the project will explore the feasibility of a network of central bank wholesale digital money and commercial bank digital money on a shared multientity distributed ledger. According to the Fed the proof-of-concept will also test the feasibility of a programmable digital money design that may be extensible to other digital assets.

“The NYIC looks forward to collaborating with members of the banking community to advance research on asset tokenization and the future of financial market infrastructures in the US as money and banking evolve” Per von Zelowitz director of the New York Innovation Center said in a prepared statement.

The US lags behind other nations in developing a CBDC prompting critics to warn that the slow response could undermine US leadership in global financial markets. But the NY Fed cautions against interpreting the test as a shift in strategy.

“It is not intended to advance any specific policy outcome nor is it intended to signal that the Federal Reserve will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a retail or wholesale CBDC nor how one would necessarily be designed” the statement further noted.

The findings of the pilot project will be released after it concludes.

Further the research from previous existing studies supplemented with data collected by local State and National-level authorities can inform and optimise interventions to improve financial access in the country.The 2022 Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs showed that India is amongst the lowest-ranked countries in the world for women’s entrepreneurship. Especially in the post-pandemic period it is more pressing than ever to collate and analyse data regarding women entrepreneurship. According to recent reports from the World Bank and several other organisations women-owned businesses were severely impacted during the pandemic. Factors such as personal challenges including significantly greater at-home care responsibilities posed as a major obstacle in women running their businesses. The lack of comprehensive data on the financial performance of women-owned businesses especially in the MSME segment has also deemed them to be perceived as high risk which impacts their creditworthiness. In a recent survey by ICRIER and NABARD it was found that 60.5% of MSME owners find credit access difficult. Further 47.7% of owners stated it was tougher to get a loan as a woman due to the existing gender bias.Women’s contribution to the Indian economy is poorly measured with limited indicators in dated surveys that cannot accurately inform decision-making. Even fewer nationally representative datasets exist that have tracked the performance of different types of women-owned enterprises across states. Financial institutions require the creation of a support structure that allows them to positively evaluate the credit risk profile of women-led enterprises.Despite existing scorecards like the Female Entrepreneurship Index by Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute there is limited insight into intra-country differences in policy the entrepreneurial ecosystem and the business capacity of entrepreneurs. As a result of these measurement gaps there is no existing method that evaluates and addresses the gaps in the Indian entrepreneurship ecosystem for women.Furthermore the existing schemes do not have a customised approach that reflects the needs of rural women entrepreneurs. The statistics from the All India Debt and Investment Survey in 2019 showed the number of women holding bank deposits is rapidly growing with 80.7% of women in rural India and 81.3% in urban India having deposits in banks. However this has not resulted in access to credit.Traditionally policies for financial inclusion in India focused on the significance of savings over access to credit. Today there is a need to provide women access to capital through alternate means and change the perception of risk coverage in rural areas. While there are adequate funds being made available through various schemes there is a need for a robust credit enhancement mechanism to provide loans to women entrepreneurs. For example strategic collaborations between the banks and financial Institutions and the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) authorities can establish the right credit evaluation techniques and tools to financial institutions which can in turn help disburse loans to women entrepreneurs across the nation.This can only be achieved through greater visibility into women-led businesses and then addressing barriers with specialised financial products.Cohesive quantitative and qualitative data on the typology (in terms of turnover investment sector geography etc) of women entrepreneurs and their credit needs will help in designing a robust and future-proof program for the financial empowerment of women entrepreneurs. In this endeavor both qualitative and quantitative data - credit asks business cash flow cycles moveable assets and financial footprint for credit enhancement mechanisms and assessment tools will be essential in overcoming the inherent barriers found in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.Learnings from the success of past credit enhancement pilots need to be organised before insights can be used to inform interventions. Several pilot studies have been initiated by financial institutions such as Mann Deshi BASIC MFIs and fintech firms like Centrum Aye Finance and RedCarpet to name a few that have looked at CIBIL-like ratings and property while evaluating credit proposals. Importantly the results of these projects are neither documented nor made readily available to inform future frameworks. These learnings have also not yet been communicated to public sector banks to create a comprehensive mechanism that brings processes technology and people together. Doing so will allow the use of reliable and relevant data in the decision-making process for credit lending to women entrepreneurs.Going forward it is imperative to establish a mechanism and institutionalise a process for systematic data collection and assessment. Furthermore the facilitation of partnerships between financial institutions and policymakers for research to be communicated and transformed into meaningful frameworks is very important. Such implementations are not possible without the aid of political will. The government is strongly pushing for digital adoption working to create comprehensive data infrastructure and platforms for ease of doing business such as the National Data Analytics Platform (NDAP) which is a step towards real-time monitoring and quality data collection.Data-enabled policymaking and program creation are the starting point to unlocking the immense economic potential of women entrepreneurs in the country.The writer is Co-Founder Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME),https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTEyNjA3OC9yZXN0YXVyYW50cy1yZWNlaXZlZC1hLWh1Z2UtcmV2ZW51ZS1ib29zdC1vbi1ibGFjay1mcmlkYXktd2Vla2VuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Restaurants Received A Huge Revenue Boost On Black Friday Weekend,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTEyNjA3OC9yZXN0YXVyYW50cy1yZWNlaXZlZC1hLWh1Z2UtcmV2ZW51ZS1ib29zdC1vbi1ibGFjay1mcmlkYXktd2Vla2VuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C4918B1E10>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Serbia then took a 2-1 lead in the 35th minute. Dusan Vlahovic scored his first-ever World Cup goal off a smooth shot from his left foot. Just before the end of the first half Breel Embolo tied the game for the Swiss in the 44th minute.

Switzerland came out strong to begin the second half. Remo Freuler gave his country the lead in the 48th minute after Embolo danced around Serbia’s defenders which was then followed by a clean passing effort from the Swiss.

Tensions flared between both teams in stoppage time but the match would eventually end with Switzerland moving on to the next round of the tournament.

World Cup Group G: Cameroon 1 – Brazil 0

This tournament’s Group Stage matches have been full of upsets and surprises. On the final day Cameroon shocked Brazil 1-0.

The match was full of missed opportunities from both sides. Brazil had many chances in the first half to give themselves the lead but Cameroon’s keeper Devis Epassy was putting on a masterclass.

Cameroon picked up the tempo in the second half but Brazil’s defense wasn’t making it easy. In the 90+2′ Cameroon took the lead. Vincent Aboubakar capitalized on a header in the final minutes to give his country a guaranteed victory. Aboubakar took his shirt off during his celebration and received a red card. Aboubakar received a first yellow card earlier in the match causing his celebration to result in a second yellow and then ultimately a red.

Even though Cameroon upset Brazil they will not be moving on to the knockout stages. On the other hand Brazil is in the knockout stage with a match against South Korea on its schedule.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9sb25kb24vc29tZWJvZHktd2lsbC1kaWUtaWYtZm9ybWVyLW1jY29ybWljay1zLWZhY3RvcnktaXNuLXQtdG9ybi1kb3duLW5laWdoYm91cnMtc2F5LTEuNzE5OTI4OdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS43MTk5Mjg5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Somebody will die' if former McCormick's factory isn't torn down neighbours say,"The owners of the former McCormick's candy factory on Dundas Street have been ordered by city bylaw officials to restore security fencing around the crumbling building but business owners near the property say much more needs to be done to deal with what they call a dangerous eyesore.

""The fence usually lasts 48 hours"" said Gord Inglis who operates Inglis Cycle located on McCormick Boulevard behind the property. ""It's very run down neglected not looked after and ignored and it's turned into a playground for children and an area where homeless people [go] in and out.""

A work order was posted on three parts of the fence surrounding some of the property stating that a property inspection done May 8 found contraventions of a city bylaw that requires owners to ensure that vacant buildings are secured against unauthorized entry and to protect the building from the risk of ""fire accident or other danger.""

When a CBC News reporter visited the site on Thursday there were at least eight places where the fence had been torn down partially or completely allowing anyone to walk onto the property.

Windows doors and duct openings were recently covered with plywood Inglis said but that's also usually torn down within days.

Redevelopment of the factory has stalled while the owner of the property appeals limits set by city council. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

Two young teens had to be rescued from the roof of the building on Sunday night London Fire said. There was a fire in the building and the teens who were exploring inside made their way to the roof while they waited for help said Platoon Chief Kirk Loveland. An aerial ladder was used to communicate with the youth and tell them to stay put until firefighters came to the roof to escort them out of the building he said. The teens weren't hurt and were taken away by police.

A similar incident happened on Thursday afternoon. A teen was stuck in the building and police requested the aerial truck again so they could communicate with the young person and escort them out of the building.

Seeing young people in the building is a frequent occurrence Inglis said. ""I feel the city is playing with the devil. Every time an emergency service is called to the building it seems to be more severe. If you don't do something with this building somebody is going to get hurt.""

There are concerns over this former east London factory as redevelopment plans have stalled Duration 0:56 Once a bustling confectionary factory the former McCormick building is now an eyesore that is dangerous for people going in to strip out any metal that can be sold for cash and youth looking for an urban exploring thrill.

'We're picking up garbage everyday'

The recent rescue was just one of the latest incidents where emergency crews were called to the building said Lou Fatibene who owns neighbouring Dundas Automotive.

""I'm surprised nobody's been killed over there yet"" Fatibene said. ""We've had cars broken into the whole area has been vandalized. We're picking up garbage every day.""

Somebody's going to die"" he said. ""How much did it cost us taxpayers to have that aerial truck out there to save the kids?""

Tena Smith who works at Tim's Tires across the street from the old factory says young people are using it as an urban exploration site. Some throw bricks and other items from the roof damaging property and cars below.

""Every Monday when we come in after the weekend it's like the teenagers have had a heyday in there and they've knocked out more windows"" she said. ""We used to park our cars over there to make room for our customers but they throw stuff off the roof. A brick landed on my car and dented my roof so we don't park over there anymore.""

The fence that's supposed to keep people out of the crumbling factory is not very effective. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

The owners of the property Sierra Construction based in Woodstock did not reply to emails and phone calls asking for comment. They have until May 12 to comply with the city's work order.

The company bought the property for $1. In 2021 McCormick Villages Inc. owned and run by Sierra Construction submitted a plan for a subdivision for the factory site comprising of five hectares. In October 2022 city council approved the development which included repurposing the former factory into a mixed-use mid-rise building as well as townhouses a long-term care facility and a seniors apartment building on the property.

But Sierra Construction wasn't happy with council's decision to limit the apartment building height to five-storeys and to make a multi-use path on the property publicly-accessible among other issues. The Ontario Land Tribunal will consider that appeal in June.

It's been frustrating watching the building and property fall further and further into disrepair said Ward 4 Coun. Susan Stevenson. ""It's becoming a huge safety concern and a lot of people are worried that there will be a tragedy there let alone the disturbance to the neighbourhood that's happening as well"" she said. ""The neighbours just want it taken down.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers sign draft picks Mason McCormick Logan Lee to rookie contracts,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/sports/steelers-sign-draft-picks-mason-mccormick-logan-lee-to-rookie-contracts/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Alandria Worthy tells WXIA-TV that her labor was intensifying and her fiancé was driving her to the hospital Wednesday morning when they stopped so she could use the bathroom at the fast food restaurant.

“I went into the bathroom and my water broke immediately” Worthy said.

Worthy said she started screaming. Restaurant manager Tunisia Woodward went to see what was happening.

“I open this door didn’t see anyone but I saw feet (under the door)” Woodward said. “I opened and she was on this toilet lying back screaming. Then I knew to tell my crew ‘We’re having a baby today.’”

Woodward and two workers began to help. The fiancé Deandre Phillips came in to check what was taking so long only to find Worthy giving birth.

“I was trying to calm her down because she was frantic” Phillips said. “I was like ‘Just breathe.’ I got her on the floor and I took off my clothes. The ladies at McDonald’s were at her front side holding her hands I had her feet propped up on my knees. We told her to push three pushes. She was a fighter.”

Less than fifteen minutes later Nandi Ariyah Moremi Phillips was born.

“Oh my God it’s still crazy that it happened” Worthy said.

“Yes she popped out onto my hand” Phillips said.

The parents tell the TV station “divine intervention” brought them to McDonald’s where three women could help.

“We all are mothers and so we put our heads together and all we needed daddy to do was catch the baby. And he did” Woodward said of herself and her coworkers Sha’querria Kaigler and Keisha Blue-Murray.

Although the baby’s birth certificate reads “Nandi Ariyah Moremi Phillips” the McDonald’s crew gave the baby girl another name.

“I said we’re going to name her Little Nugget. That’s her nickname: McDonald’s Little Nugget” Woodward said.

That nickname may stick.

“She’s definitely a nugget” Phillips agreed. “My parents loved the name too. We were like okay it fits her. My little nugget.”

Steve Akinboro who owns the franchise awarded the employees $250 gift cards. Woodward said she’ll spend all the money on Nandi."
MCK,McKesson,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZ2ZtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2NvbXBhbmllcy1zaHJpbmstb2ZmaWNlLWZvb3RwcmludC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Companies Shrink Their Office Footprint,"Now that remote work has become the new normal for some companies they are cutting back on office space to cut costs.





Yelp McKesson Affirm Meta—the American companies that have embraced remote work are busy resizing their office footprint.

Meta Platforms the parent company of Facebook recently announced that it would consolidate its office space in New York and San Francisco. CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared he would cut 11000 employees from its workforce and much of the remaining staff chose to work from home. Meta no longer needs its offices on New York’s Park Avenue South or Broadway; there is no good reason to keep an individual desk for a surprise visit from a remote worker. The company will maintain collective desks that can be reserved or used when someone drops in.

Dave Wehner Meta’s chief financial officer expects to save a bundle on real estate expenses but he must spend a lot on canceling leases and abandoning new spaces that will never be used. During the third-quarter conference call the CFO disclosed $900 million in charges related to the consolidation of facilities by the end of the year. He added $2 billion for the following year.

Other expenses will pile up. For instance remote workers get stipends to buy equipment. Having remote workers increases cloud access and creates potential vulnerabilities so Meta and other companies need to adjust their cyber defenses.

These added expenses are costly in the short term but there will be significant savings for companies once space reductions are fully implemented. Global Workplace Analytics calculated that if American employees were telecommuting half the time their employers would save $500 billion yearly in real estate electricity absenteeism turnover and other factors.

Introduced into standard therapy in 2000 they changed CML from a fatal disease to a chronic condition compatible with normal life.

Today several such oral drugs are available on the market. But they cost on average more than $200000 per year when under patent which can be for 12 to 20 years or longer depending on how the pharmaceutical company modifies the patent’s conditions. With many insurers charging patients out-of-pocket expenses of up to 25% such drugs — though readily available — can become unaffordable without an annual cap making patients “functionally uninsured.” It is estimated that up to 30% of patients with CML and other cancers are in this situation.

The first such drug for CML was imatinib (Gleevec). It lost its patent in 2017 and is now available as a generic drug with 15 formulations on the market in the U.S. The common wisdom is that once four to five generic versions of a drug become available its price falls drastically. Sadly this has not been the case for CML drugs nor for most cancer drugs in the existing health care system.

It is true that the average price of the 15 imatinib generics has fallen from more than $130000 per year to about $5000 per year (a price still much higher than the cost to manufacture the drug which is less than $400 per year). But that is the price drug companies charge. Once a drug is manufactured it starts a complex often inconsistent supply chain path allowing different intermediaries along the way to insert their own profit margins.

These include wholesalers pharmacies hospitals group purchasing organizations and pharmacy benefit managers. The price that wholesalers (including the top three U.S. drug distributors AmerisourceBergen McKesson and Cardinal Health) pay to acquire drugs from manufacturers is called a wholesale acquisition cost or WAC while the price that pharmacies or hospitals pay wholesalers is known as the average wholesale price or AWP. Pharmacies and hospitals are usually part of a group purchasing organization that negotiates to buy drugs at a lower cost called the GPO price. As the supply chain moves closer to the patient other intermediaries become involved including pharmacy benefit managers who control what medications are on insurance formularies. The pharmacy benefit managers negotiate drug prices directly with manufacturers and often maximize their leverage by securing deals with manufacturers for significant rebates. This increases both the profits of pharmacy benefit managers and the prices patients pay.

The end result is a price bubble that benefits many of the players but not the patient. In the instance of generic imatinib while the average price of the drug when it leaves the manufacturer is $5000 per year 12 of the 15 generics end up costing the patient an astounding $132000 per year.

Enter into this mix billionaire Mark Cuban who recently launched Cost Plus an online drug company that bypasses distributors and offers generic medications to patients (with a physician prescription) at cost plus 15%. The company’s mission is to reduce the complexity of the drug supply chain and charge the lowest possible prices while still making good profits. Among the list of available drugs is generic imatinib offered at $47 per month. Purchased through this process the price can now be as low as $565 per year which is relatively affordable and even cheaper than what a patient with prescription insurance might pay.

This is a model that physicians and patients should publicize encourage and use often. Similar companies are following the same model including Civica Rx ScriptCo Pharmacy Honeybee Pharmacy GeniusRx Ro Pharmacy and hopefully many others. Each has its variations but adheres to the common theme of bypassing intermediaries and providing the fastest and cheapest route for a drug from manufacturer to patient. A study in the Annals of Internal Medicine has estimated that Medicare could have saved conservatively $3.6 billion in 2020 had it purchased 77 generic drugs from Cuban’s Cost Plus Drug Company.

There are some downsides to this model as evidenced by Cost Plus. First most of the medications offered are generics and are only for chronic conditions. Second patients with chronic conditions are often on multiple medications and if they cannot obtain all their prescriptions through Cost Plus and need to use other pharmacies their prescriptions will be fragmented. And third Cost Plus does not bill insurance and patients will not be contributing to their deductibles.

These issues will hopefully be mitigated over time as the success of this model over the traditional distribution path encourages Cost Plus and similar companies to expand their inventories and accept insurance. By disrupting the traditional U.S. drug supply chain the “Mark Cuban effect” could significantly reduce the cost of drugs and health care in the U.S. in addition to making many much-needed cancer drugs available and affordable for more patients. This could save the lives of thousands of patients over the next decade.

“We really need the investigators to pay very close attention to what the patients are telling us because the people who are working centrally on the trial are not with the patient. They cannot interview the patient. And so those investigators have to give us the correct information so that we can classify the patient properly and figure out which seizure types are getting better and which ones are not.”

Conducting clinical trials in neurologic disease can be a challenge and doing so in epilepsy carries some of its own unique difficulties. One of the major roadblocks now in a time where the development of antiseizure medications (ASM) is making great progress is the correct classification of seizure types among patients enrolled in trials.

This process of clinical semiology was the focus of a talk given by Jacqueline French MD at the 2022 American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting held December 2 to 6 in Nashville Tennessee. French a professor of neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the chief medical officer of the Epilepsy Foundation provided an overview of some of the modern perspectives on seizure classification and the importance of proper patient definition when it comes to enrollment in ASM trials.

In a conversation with NeurologyLive® French further explained that one of the biggest areas of discrepancy in the information that clinicians who are interviewing patients for enrollment are providing to clinical trial investigators is in the category of tonic-clonic seizures. This seizure type carries a high risk of adverse outcomes for patients who experience them making their proper identification crucial to ensuring ASMs targeted at treating them are effective.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Cramer's market predictions and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks According To Jim Cramer.

The investing landscape has widely transformed this year as recession fears pull investors toward previously overlooked defensive securities. Jim Cramer the host of Mad Money on CNBC advises investors to invest in profitable companies that have strong shareholder returns. In addition to this he also talked about loading up on high-yielding dividend stocks in one of his shows recorded in late September.

In one of his recent shows in October Cramer mentioned that tech stocks have fallen this year because of the tightening monetary policy. However the decline in tech stocks opens new investment avenues for investors where they can take refuge in other sectors. According to Cramer some of the industries that investors should focus on include fossil fuels healthcare travel defense and food and beverage.

According to Cramer the continuous interest rate hikes this year indicate that the trend will likely continue for the rest of the year. This eventually increases the risks of a possible recession. He further mentioned that though the rapidly rising treasury yields have put pressure on dividend stocks they still offer better investment opportunities than the rest of the market. He mentioned that investors should steadily build their position in dividends to gain maximum profits.

Dividend stocks are becoming increasingly popular among investors this year as many companies reinstated and raised their payouts after the pandemic of 2020. According to the third quarter report of the S&P Dow Jones Indices cash dividends within the S&P 500 set record payments in Q3 and saw an 8.5% growth from the same period last year. The report also highlighted that dividends are expected to reach their record by the next quarter. Some of the most popular dividend stocks include Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) as they have raised their dividends for a long time.

In view of the above-stated arguments and to further expand upon Cramer’s investment strategy we will discuss the best dividend stocks according to Jim Cramer.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzA0L3RoaXMtZmFtZWQtcHJvZmVzc29yLXRoaW5rcy1tZXRhLWlzLWFsbC11cHNpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Famed Finance Professor Thinks Meta Platforms Is All Upside. Is He Right?,"Even in a ""doomsday scenario"" Meta has little downside.

Meta Platforms (META 0.16%) has suffered an epic collapse over the last year.

The Facebook parent's pivot to the metaverse is on track to cost it $13 billion in operating losses this year and its ad business has slowed dramatically due to competition from TikTok Apple's crackdown on ad tracking and macroeconomic headwinds.

While that's all bad news what's already happened to Meta stock shouldn't matter at this point. What does matter is if the stock offers a good value at its current price or if the discounted value of future cash flows is greater than the current valuation. So the best question to ask about the stock isn't ""Is the business struggling?"" The question is ""Is Meta a good value now?""

One of the brightest and most respected minds in finance and valuation NYU Finance Professor Aswath Damodaran the author of several books on valuation including The Little Book of Valuation just answered that question with a resounding ""yes.""

The worst-case scenario

In a recent blog post Damodaran valued Meta under a ""doomsday"" scenario.

Damodaran's assumptions started with Meta's trailing-12-month operating income which appears to be temporarily impaired by macroeconomic headwinds. He also assumed there would be no growth in advertising income and the business would have 20 more years of life. R&D expenses will continue to be $32 billion a year Damodaran assumed and Meta will lose $10 billion a year in reality labs its division devoted to the metaverse. Finally Damodaran assigned a 9% cost of capital to Meta as he believes it's in the 75th percentile of risk.

That gives the company a no-growth net income of $26.7 billion for the next 20 years.

Under those circumstances Damodaran found that Meta's equity is valued at about $259 billion or $330 billion without reality labs. By comparison Meta's current market cap is $325 billion meaning the stock has essentially no downside if you back out the losses from the metaverse business.

At the stock's bottom a few weeks ago its market cap had fallen all the way down to just $236 billion.

Is Damodaran right?

This isn't the first time the NYU professor has taken a stab at Meta's valuation. In fact back in February Damodaran valued the FAANG stock at $346.16 a share though the stock was trading at just $220 then. That valuation assumed the company would sustain a 40% operating margin which now seems impossible given the money it's pouring into the metaverse project.

That exercise also highlights how calculating valuations is often an academic practice as it's hard to predict future cash flows especially for a company like Meta which in the midst of a business-model change.

Admittedly Damodaran's doomsday model is crude as it doesn't assume any changes in the company's operating income for the next 20 years and the company's business is likely to change in a number of ways.

What we do know is that Meta will probably report a wider loss next year than it will in 2022. Already the company has told investors to expect losses in reality labs to significantly expand next year meaning they could reach $15 billion to $20 billion. However management said that from 2024 on it would aim to control reality-labs spending so the company can grow overall operating income.

Facebook's advertising business is also a question mark as the company has clearly been impacted by Apple's ad-tracking changes and competition from TikTok but there's some good news on this front. Management said on the third-quarter earnings call that it's lapping the worst of the ad-targeting restrictions so the headwinds from those changes will start to disappear. The company has also been investing heavily in Reels its TikTok-like short-form video product and the company expects Reels will begin making a material impact to operating income in the next 12 to 18 months.

Damodaran's doomsday valuation should offer some comfort to Meta shareholders as it's a strong indication the floor on the stock price is high even if various things go wrong.

While the next year still looks challenging for Meta the long-term picture looks favorable especially considering the limited downside at its current price according to Damodaran.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmV1L2FydGljbGUvZXUtZmluZXMtbWV0YS1wcml2YWN5LXRlY2gtc2VjdXJpdHktZmFjZWJvb2std2hhdHNhcHAtaW5zdGFncmFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta faces record EU privacy fines – POLITICO,"According to filings in Ireland Meta has set aside €3 billion for EU privacy fines in 2022 and 2023. Its platform Instagram already got slapped with a €405 million fine in September for violating kids' privacy and Facebook so far has accumulated €282 million in penalties for data breaches as well as a €60 million hit from the French. That leaves well over €2 billion earmarked by the firm for regulatory action.

That's a substantial hit for Meta which announced last month it was laying off 11000 employees globally amid lower sales and major costs linked to the firm's pivot to the metaverse.

Beyond hitting Meta's pocket the three fines expected within weeks could also put a bomb under its broader business model. The decisions stem from complaints filed by Austrian activist Max Schrems accusing the company of failing to have proper legal grounds to process millions of Europeans' data. If the final decisions invalidate Meta’s argument that it’s processing data as part of a contract with users the company would have to seek another legal basis for its data-fuelled ad targeting model.

The cases have also revealed deep fissures between Europe's data watchdogs.

Ireland's data protection commission largely backed Meta's argument that it could claim it needs data to fulfill a ""contract"" with its users to provide personalized ads in its draft decision issued a year ago. But that reasoning has long put Ireland in the minority amongst its colleagues. The Norwegian data protection authority said the Irish interpretation would render European data protection law “pointless” according to a document obtained by POLITICO last year. The Irish regulator was also alone in voting against EU guidelines that banned companies from using the contract legal basis to use data to target ads.

The three decisions are likely to lay into the Irish regulator's initial position and more worryingly for Meta amp up the pressure for the company to go scrambling for new legal ways to gather and process data on Europeans.

Meta also still faces an ongoing high-profile probe into the company's transfers of Europeans' data to the U.S.

Meta declined to comment. It can still appeal the fines coming out of the coming decisions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL21lZGlhLXRlbGVjb20vbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtcGxhbnMtbGF3LXJlcXVpcmUtZmFjZWJvb2stZ29vZ2xlLXBheS1uZXdzLTIwMjItMTItMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Zealand plans law to require Facebook Google to pay for news,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL21lZGlhLXRlbGVjb20vbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtcGxhbnMtbGF3LXJlcXVpcmUtZmFjZWJvb2stZ29vZ2xlLXBheS1uZXdzLTIwMjItMTItMDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C492BD8580>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Yelp McKesson Affirm Meta—the American companies that have embraced remote work are busy resizing their office footprint.

Meta Platforms the parent company of Facebook recently announced that it would consolidate its office space in New York and San Francisco. CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared he would cut 11000 employees from its workforce and much of the remaining staff chose to work from home. Meta no longer needs its offices on New York’s Park Avenue South or Broadway; there is no good reason to keep an individual desk for a surprise visit from a remote worker. The company will maintain collective desks that can be reserved or used when someone drops in.

Dave Wehner Meta’s chief financial officer expects to save a bundle on real estate expenses but he must spend a lot on canceling leases and abandoning new spaces that will never be used. During the third-quarter conference call the CFO disclosed $900 million in charges related to the consolidation of facilities by the end of the year. He added $2 billion for the following year.

Other expenses will pile up. For instance remote workers get stipends to buy equipment. Having remote workers increases cloud access and creates potential vulnerabilities so Meta and other companies need to adjust their cyber defenses.

These added expenses are costly in the short term but there will be significant savings for companies once space reductions are fully implemented. Global Workplace Analytics calculated that if American employees were telecommuting half the time their employers would save $500 billion yearly in real estate electricity absenteeism turnover and other factors.

Reviews platform Yelp has offered employees the option to work from home permanently and expects to save $10 million to $12 million a year over time. Healthcare-services expert McKesson booked more than $180 million in real estate charges for 2023 but once the shrinking of its footprint has been fully digested the company will avoid $60 million to $80 million in expenses a year.

And let’s not forget the happiness factor; telecommuters save $2000 to $7000 in transportation and other costs while savoring the flexibility of their work arrangement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDgxNjY5OC9hcHBsZS1tZXNzYWdlcy1tZXRhLXdoYXRzYXBwLXByaXZhY3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Care about privacy?

It keeps both teams in the NFC playoff picture.

The Washington Commanders (7-5-1) are sputtering into their bye week after a 23-20 loss to the New York Giants (7-4-1) Sunday afternoon at MetLife Stadium.

The Commanders and Giants traded punches all throughout the game but the first blow came on the fourth play of the game when Jonathan Allen forced Daniel Jones to fumble. Washington was able to generate a field goal off the turnover to take the lead.

Washington added to its lead with a 19-yard touchdown to Terry McLaurin to go up multiple scores. However New York was able to come back immediately after consecutive scoring drives tied the game at 10. The two teams traded field goals right before the half to keep it a 13-13 tie at halftime.

Shortly after the teams came out for the second half Washington fumbled and tossed the ball right back to New York. The Giants capitalized with a touchdown to wide receiver Isaiah Hodgins to take a 20-13 lead.

The defenses took over for most of the second half but Washington had a chance to tie it with under four minutes to go. Heinicke led an eight-play 90-yard drive in under two minutes that ended in a 28-yard touchdown to rookie wideout Jahan Dotson which tied the game.

Inside the two-minute warning and overtime both teams failed to score and the game remained tied after 70 minutes of action.

The tie represents how close both teams are to one another. It's the first tie for Washington since 2016 and New York's first since 1997. The last tie for New York also came against Washington which was the last time two NFC East teams tied in a game.

The Commanders are off next week but will face the same Giants in their backyard on Dec. 18 at 1 p.m.

Currently in Las Vegas for their Permission to Dance On Stage concerts Taehyung seems to be determined to make most of his time in the USA. The 26-year-old singer often shares snippets of his day with fans online some of them featuring him playing golf.

This time Taehyung shared two clips of himself on an actual golf course. Often practicing his swing or using a simulator this was a pleasant change for fans. Furthermore Taehyung chose to play at an iconic venue in Las Vegas.

To any golf fan the Shadow Creek Golf Course logo/flag is easily noticeable especially with the words written on the caddie. The course is also owned by MGM which is linked to the Allegiant Stadium where BTS is performing.

Kim Taehyung wows fans by playing golf at Shadow Creek

In the two (now deleted) clips shared Taehyung is seen making a birdie and then subsequently high-fiving everyone present.

The venue itself is known for some iconic events including the 2018 Match between two golf icons – Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.

More about Shadow Creek

As per their site you gain entry to the course when you are a guest at an MGM Resorts International destination. Later on a limousine will be available for transportation while a personal caddie is available to offer the best experience. The 18 hole course is scenic offering an iconic experience for all those who choose to play there.

Designed by Tom Fazio and Steve Wynn the VIP course has also hosted the 2021 Bank of Hope LPGA Match Play.

As per reports the green fee is around $600 which is only an addition to the cost of staying at an MGM Resort. Additionally time for guests is limited from Monday to Tuesday. Otherwise the course also invites people to play.

Of course Woods and Mickelson’s The Match has made the venue much more popular.

Where else has Taehyung played golf?

Apart from Shadow Creek Taehyung has apparently also played at Topgolf in Las Vegas. He played at the Chairman’s suite which can cost up to $8000 for three hours. Preferred by many celebrities it was described as an ultra-VIP experience.

With Taehyung clearly dedicated to his golf one can only hope to see the second-youngest BTS singer to play at more locations.

Still too often there are incidents that indicate otherwise.

There was much lacking at the Las Vegas Invitational which was supposed to be a top-flight experience and showcase for major woman’s basketball programs on par with the Bahamas and the first-class running of the Phil Knight events in Portland. Instead it was run in a manner that wouldn’t even be acceptable for Division III a reference we will get to.

“We have an obligation to grow our game and we completely missed on this opportunity because you have a lot of really good teams that are here representing their conferences” Indiana coach Teri Moren has said. “This was a major miss in my opinion in terms of helping to grow this game.”

Laid out in a ballroom at the Mirage Resort and Casino there were no temporary bleachers set up like they have in other ballroom events like the Bahamas just folding chairs around the court. Players were advised to bring their own towels from their hotel rooms none to be provided at the playing venue.

Worst of all Auburn’s Kharyssa Richardson was injured during a game and had to wait 45 minutes for paramedics to arrive none on site to respond immediately. Moren who took her program to the Sweet 16 in Bridgeport last March nearly pulled out of Vegas at that point.

“It’s probably the last time they’ll get a good team to go to that tournament” Geno Auriemma said after the UConn women won the trophy in Portland last week. “It’s almost that condescending kind of thinking ‘Yeah wouldn’t it be neat to have the gals come out here and play.’ It’s unfortunate for them to have to go through something like that.”

UConn sophomore star Azzi Fudd too stepped up and spoke out with a clear voice. “It kind of shocked me” she said. “It gave me AAU vibes. I remember playing in ballrooms like that. I couldn’t believe that was a college game being played like that. I just think we need to do better.”

After the outrage went national the finger pointing began. Ryan Polk the site coordinator told ESPN he apologized to Moren. Polk incidentally perhaps ironically works for the University of Hartford with the title assistant director employer relations career and professional development according to the school’s website. At UHart resources for athletics has been cut to the bare bones and beyond which in part prompted men’s basketball coach John Gallagher to resign just before the season after his team played a scrimmage without an athletic trainer present. So opponents of UHart’s administration and its move to Division III acquired more social media ammo.

“We’re very sorry” Polk told ESPN. “The court and the lighting that stuff hasn’t been an issue. But we needed to have full-on bleachers. We have notified The Mirage we won’t be coming back again. This is a one-time disaster in terms of events. It definitely did not go the way we thought or planned. We just severely missed the mark when comes to the spectator side.”

MGM Resorts blamed Polk and cut ties with his group but a concern of that size should have been more hands-on as to what is and isn’t done in connection with its brand.

“We take great pride in hosting events of all sizes and providing world-class experiences and accommodations to our guests” MGM Resorts said in a statement to ESPN. “MGM Resorts and the Mirage did not organize operate or sponsor the Las Vegas Invitational. Mr. Polk was the site coordinator and was responsible for all aspects of this tournament.”

It doesn’t matter whose fault it was though. The ball was dropped and 50 years since Title IX was passed and a year and a half after Oregon’s Sedona Prince called attention to the disparity in faculties at the NCAA Tournament bubble it’s just as Fudd said: “We need to do better.”

A Husky’s pride among Giants

Players in NFL locker rooms love to throw shade on each other’s alma mater so repping UConn in the NFL has come with that hazard. But former Husky Matt Peart an offensive lineman in his third season with the Giants can smile ear to ear as the Huskies 6-6 await their bowl assignment.

“I’m excited” Peart said after a practice this week in East Rutherford N.J. “I’m excited for the program to finally turn it around a lot of energy. They definitely have the building blocks of a great culture. It’s a testament to the players a testament to the coaches. They’re fighting for each other and believe in their coach it’s awesome to watch.”

Former UConn lineman Matt Peart is representing his resurgent alma mater in the NFL with the Giants and thrilled by what’s going on in Storrs.

Peart who started 48 games for coaches Bob Diaco and Randy Edsall at UConn 9-39 over that span was drafted in the third round in 2020. He tore his ACL last season but made it back in mid-November. He also made it back to Rentschler Field this season for the Syracuse game a UConn loss and has watched whenever his schedule allows.

“I keep in touch with the guys” Peart said “like Chase Lundt Christian Haynes Eric Watts and Jackson Mitchell — Mr. Connecticut doing his thing. I’m happy for them man I’m really really happy.”

Giants teammate Darnay Holmes who played for Jim Mora at UCLA has filled him in and Peart hopes to visit the team in the offseason. “I’ve heard nothing but good things” he said. “So I can’t wait to finally meet [Mora] in person.”

Sunday short takes

* So am I the only one who out of force of habit checks even hockey or World Cup stat sheets to see if Nika Mühl got an assist?

* New Canaan’s Drew Pyne entered the transfer portal Friday leaving Notre Dame where he became the starting quarterback and won eight of 10 games four of five against top 25 teams. He threw 22 touchdown passes against six interceptions competing 64.6 percent. With three years eligibility Pyne will be a great get for somebody. Meanwhile Glastonbury’s Tyler Van Dyke appears set on returning to Miami after a season marred by shoulder injuries according to reports.

* Kemba Walker idle since last February is back in the NBA to play a role with the Mavericks. It’s been a rough go for the UConn legend whose turns with the Celtics and Knicks turned sour but at 32 he believes he has some basketball left despite his problematic knees. Even after signing him Mavs GM Nico Harrison isn’t sure. “We’ll see how long it lasts” Harrison told a Dallas radio station.

* The scheduling in Portland didn’t allow the UConn men’s basketball team to attend the women’s games and reciprocate the support. But the men’s players and staff attended the women’s first game back home against Providence on Friday.

*If Jacob deGrom wanted to be a Met like Edwin Diaz he would be. The Mets’ offer was more than fair but he wanted to go to Texas. Fortunately a pitcher isn’t a Picasso so Steve Cohen will find another to take all that money.

* The USA-England scoreless draw at the World Cup Nov. 25 was the most viewed soccer match ever on U.S. television with 15.4 million viewers. It was most popular in the Kansas City Hartford and Boston markets. Ratings in our area have been consistently high.

* After winning his tournament in Portland Auriemma was delighted to point out the Manchester Travel Basketball program’s 4th- and 7th-grade boys teams won their tournaments in Southington last week. “We’re Title Town” he said.

Last word

The first sports book I ever read at age 12 was Gaylord Perry’s Me and the Spitter which I wanted after reading the hilarious first chapter as an excerpt in Sport Magazine. The book was written in 1974 with Bob Sudyk who was later a columnist at The Courant and was meant to be tongue-in-cheek part of his act to get in hitters’ heads not a bald-face admission that he threw illegal pitches. Somehow although the ball was checked after nearly every pitch when Perry was on the mound he was ejected only once in his 22-year Hall of Fame career for doctoring a ball during his second-to-last season. Perry’s wink-wink catch-me-if-you-can act would be digested much differently today as opposed to the irreverent 1970s when cheating was still called “gamesmanship.” But for me his passing this week at age 84 is the loss of a colorful character and the passing of a fun chapter in baseball history.

The company plans to announce construction of another factory when President Biden visits the north Phoenix site Tuesday an expansion that would more than triple the company’s stake in Arizona from an original estimate of $12 billion to $40 billion.

It would also mark the state’s largest private-sector investment ever and one of the largest direct foreign investments anywhere in the United States.

Biden’s visit to TSMC is his first to the state as president. During the event TSMC also plans to announce it will produce advanced smaller 3-nanometer chips by 2026 at that new factory or fab.

The company also will announce plans to develop more advanced chips at the original facility now under construction going from 5 nanometers in size down to 4. The expanded plan is expected to more than double the number of permanent jobs at the TSMC facility.

Semiconductors or chips are the tiny brains found in an increasing array of modern products including computers cell phones other electronic gear cars and industrial products. Manufacturers that excel in smaller dimensions measured in nanometers can put more transistors on each chip run more processes and reduce costs for customers. Industries that use or are expected to use the most advanced chips include aerospace clean energy and artificial intelligence.

Dignitaries including Apple CEO Tim Cook arrive in Phoenix

Executives from some of TSMC’s most visible suppliers and customers will attend the late morning and early afternoon event at the complex near 43rd Avenue and West Dove Valley Road. The dignitaries include Apple CEO Tim Cook TSMC founder Morris Chang Micron Technology CEO Sanjay Mehrotra and NVIDIA Corp. CEO Jensen Huang. Apple has announced plans to buy chips made at the north Phoenix facility.

Attending government and political figures include U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo Sen. Mark Kelly Gov. Doug Ducey Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego and several members of Congress from Arizona including Raul Grijalva Tom O’Halleran and Greg Stanton along with former Rep. Gabby Giffords. Like Biden the politicians are all Democrats aside from Ducey.

In September Raimondo joined Kelly and local political academic and business leaders at a semiconductor-focused discussion at Arizona State University's research park in Tempe.

Biden to tout various benefits of CHIPS Act

The president plans to note how the new TSMC investments were encouraged by passage of legislation including the CHIPS & Science Act which he championed. TSMC could receive federal subsidies under that legislation once the government releases funding guidelines in the first quarter of 2023.

In addition Biden is expected to argue that Arizonans overall are feeling positive impacts from his economic policies through a relatively low unemployment rate and job creation that he said is helping working families including disadvantaged groups. In August for example the National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced $105 million for high-speed internet projects in tribal areas in Arizona.

However Arizona and metro Phoenix also are hobbled by rising interest rates during his tenure as president that have led to a housing slowdown and the inflation rate in greater Phoenix has exceeded that of every other large U.S. metro area throughout most of 2022.

Few details have emerged yet on other challenges the TSMC investments could entail such as water consumption by these large fabs. Water supplies in particular are getting tighter here and throughout the Southwest with Colorado River cutbacks coming. The company plans to recycle water for multiple phases of manufacturing and other needs.

In fact TSMC said it's planning an on-site industrial water reclamation facility that it claims will result in nearly no liquid discharge.

“When complete TSMC Arizona will be the greenest semiconductor manufacturing facility in the United States producing the most advanced semiconductor-process technology in the country enabling next generation high-performance and low-power computing products for years to come” said TSMC’s Chairman Dr. Mark Liu in a prepared statement.

Part of broad industrial strategy for US

Biden is expected to describe how the TSMC complexes and semiconductors generally fit into a broader national economic strategy focused around the CHIPS & Science Act. One goal is to provide stable predictable federal funding that could encourage private-sector investments too from both U.S. and foreign businesses.

The latest announcement will mean more jobs. TSMC originally was planning on hiring about 2000 people at its north Phoenix complex but that could rise to 4500 including the second phase. That’s in addition to an estimated 10000 construction jobs.

Securing a stable supply of semiconductors is another aim of the legislation and Biden’s industrial policy. A chip shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic slowed some production of automobiles and other manufacturing activity.

Investments rolling into Arizona

Other corporations also have made important investments of late in Arizona including a $20 billion semiconductor expansion underway at Intel’s Chandler campus.

The Intel expansion was hailed as the largest private sector investment in Arizona history a record likely surpassed by the new TSMC projects.

Biden is expected to discuss how his broad economic policies could lead to $3.5 trillion in combined private- and public-sector investments over the next decade arguing that U.S. manufacturing is enjoying a renaissance under his leadership.

Other recent Phoenix-area corporation investments that Biden might cite include a $1.2 billion lithium-ion battery factory in Buckeye announced by KORE Power and a $100 million Corning factory in Gilbert to make fiber-optic cable. The KORE batteries are intended to be used in electric vehicles for electric-grid storage and in other applications.

The company showed off its HBv4 instances including AMD EPYC 9004 Genoa as well as a large OAM chassis. We wanted to snap a few photos and show our readers since it shows the great lengths companies are going to in order to cool modern processors with air.

Microsoft Azure at SC22 and The Enormous AMD EPYC Genoa Heatsink on HBv4

In the Azure SC22 booth Microsoft had on display the hardware powering its HBv4 instances. Microsoft was early in realizing that HPC could be done in the cloud and built an Infiniband-backed infrastructure with high-end compute nodes to make cloud HPC a reality. HBv4 is the company’s AMD EPYC 9004 Genoa instance hardware.

While normally having two large processors would be the most interesting feature the cooling was the centerpiece. It is absolutely massive. The heatsink has heat pipes that route from both CPUs and almost stretches across the entire chassis width except for some side area for cable routing.

This server also has its FPGA offload card. This card offloads the network data plane control plane and storage offload. While AWS is using its Nitro V5 DPU for many of the same functions Microsoft is using a FPGA.

For an idea of how and why this works you can see an example of when we set up something similar in This Changes Networking Intel IPU Hands-on with Big Spring Canyon.

In that we used an Intel FPGA card to remotely deliver storage presenting them as NVMe devices to the host server using an Intel IPU to manage the process. Microsoft’s solution also does networking and the company has its secret sauce but that article/ video should help understand why Microsoft is using a FPGA.

Microsoft also showed a large OAM box. One can see the AMD Instinct ROCm placard next t oit and the massive number of I/O cards.

Inside we were told these are AMD Instinct MI250X OAM modules.

It is just fun to see a huge array of heatsinks. If you saw our early 2019 Facebook Zion Accelerator Platform for OAM piece and remember this picture the production version of OAMs is very similar except the handles appear to have switched orientation.

It is fun seeing these technologies go from concept in February 2019 to production systems in November 2022.

Final Words

Microsoft has some exceptionally cool hardware. We recently featured these systems in our best of SC22 video that you can find here:

There were a lot of AMD EPYC 9004 Genoa systems on the show floor but the Microsoft heatsink was probably the standout.

Editor’s note: One day it would be fun to get one of these big heatsinks and add it to the STH YouTube set background.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2luZG93cy0xMS1wYy1tYW5hZ2VyLWluc3RhbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Install and Configure the Microsoft PC Manager on Windows 11,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2luZG93cy0xMS1wYy1tYW5hZ2VyLWluc3RhbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyZWF0aXZlYmxvcS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvc3VyZmFjZS1wcm8tNi12cy1zdXJmYWNlLXByby030gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7: Which is the best?,"Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7 pits two generations of Microsoft's sleek two-in-one laptop-tablet that are getting a little long in the tooth. The Surface Pro 9 was released in October 2022 following on from the Surface Pro 8 a year earlier. That means Surface Pro 6 and 7. Add to that the fact that there was a gap of two years between the Pro 7 and 8 and these older models are perhaps starting to show their age.

The positive side of that is that you may be able to find a good deal on them. The Surface Pro 6 is more difficult to find new but the Surface Pro 7 has been coming in for some big discounts. But does it make sense to buy the Surface Pro 6 or Surface Pro 7 in 2022?

The Surface Pro range as a whole holds some enticing advantages over other portable devices such as iPads. One the one hand they're tablets with touchscreens and stylus support but they run Windows which means you're not restricted to using mobile apps. For many creatives this can be a game changer. Add Microsoft's Surface Pro Type Cover (sold separately) and you've have a portable little laptop with stylus support for drawing note-taking and image editing.

But how do Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7 measure up today? The former was released in October 2018 and the latter in October 2019. The 2021 Surface Pro 8 introduced some significant upgrades with enhanced performance and a better screen. The latest addition the Surface Pro 9 is more of an incremental upgrade but again it provides a boost in performance. So with the Surface Pro 8 now seeing discount following the release of the 9 does it make sense to buy either of these older models?

See our full Surface Pro 8 review and our Surface Pro 9 review for our takes on the newer tablets. We also have roundups of the best Surface Pro 8 prices and the best Surface Pro 9 prices. But if you're considering one of these older devices because you've spotted a bargain here you'll find out comparison of their design performance display and battery life. For more options see our pick of the best tablets with a stylus.

Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7: are they worth buying in 2022?

Surface Pro 6 vs 7: Display

Disappointingly the Surface Pro 6 and Surface Pro 7 have exactly the same display (Image credit: Microsoft)

Comparing Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7 uncovers more similarities than differences. They were released only a year apart and anyone who was expecting the Surface Pro 7 to offer a big step up from the previous generation would have been disappointed on the tablet's release – certainly in terms of physical appearance. When we consider the screens in Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7 we're basically looking at the same display: 12.3-inches both with resolutions of 2736 x 1824.

That's no bad thing since the high-resolution screens (Microsoft calls them ‘PixelSense’) offer impressive image quality with a pixel density of 267 pixels per inch (PPI). We found they both offer very sharp clear images. The slightly odd aspect ratio of 3:2 is a little taller than the usual widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9 but this gives you a bit more space to work on vertically.

So in terms of screen at least Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7 is effectively a draw and if you can still find a Surface Pro 6 in stock at a cheaper price than the Surface Pro 7 you might want to go for that. If we turn to the Surface Pro 8 it's perhaps not surprising that it offers more of an upgrade since it came a full two years after the Surface Pro 7. The newer device comes with a slightly larger 13-inch screen and has a new ambient colour sense that adjusts to the light in the room. That may be a big enough upgrade to convince some to pay the extra money especially now there are discounts about. The new Surface Pro 9 has the same screen as the Pro 8.

Verdict: this first comparison is a draw

Surface Pro 6 vs 7: Performance

While on the surface (sorry) the two devices look identical there are some differences inside and these come out when we compare Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7 for performance. The latter does better here with improved performance and a more varied choice of configurations so you can choose the right level of power for your needs and budget.

The Surface Pro 6 only offers the choice between an 8th generation Intel Core i5-8250U or Intel Core i7-8650U and a choice of 8GB or 16GB LPDDR3 RAM. This hardware is more than capable of running Windows 10 and its creative applications and it can be upgraded to Windows 11. But the Surface Pro 7 offers a clear advantage here with a choice of 10th generation Intel processors: the Intel Core i3-1005G1 Core i5-1035G4 or Core i7-1065G7. These aren’t only more powerful than 8th generation processors; they're more power-efficient as well which means you’re getting better performance and longer battery life. Meanwhile the inclusion of a Core i3 variant gives you a more affordable option if you don’t need the power of an i5 or i7 processor.

The Surface Pro 7 also features the choice of 4GB 8GB or 16GB LPDDR4x memory which is slightly newer and faster than the RAM in the Pro 6. Microsoft claims that the Surface Pro 7 is 2.3 times faster than the Surface Pro 6 and while we don’t think the difference is quite that noticeable if you care about performance the Surface Pro 7 does offer an improvement – though note that Microsoft says that the Surface Pro 8 is 46 per cent faster than the 7 and it says that the 12th gen Intel CPU on the Surface Pro 9 delivers 50% better performance than the 8. That means that in terms of performance both the Surface Pro 6 and 7 are now left quite a way behind.

For those who require a device with powerful graphics-handling capabilities for example video editors or those working with 3D models it’s important to point out that when looking at Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7 neither have dedicated graphics cards. Instead they rely on their processors' integrated GPUs: the Intel UHD Graphics 620 of the Surface Pro 6 and the more powerful Intel Iris Plus in the i5 and i7 versions of the Surface Pro 7.

Verdict: the Surface Pro 7 is the winner here

We've mentioned that there's little in the battle between Surface Pro 6 vs 7 when it comes to design. The two devices look very similar (the same goes for the Surface Pro 7 Plus). The dimensions are the same (11.5 x 7.9 x 0.33 inches / 292 x 201 x 8.5mm). This was a bit of a disappointment on the release of the Surface Pro 7 since it means you get the same thick bezels around the display making it immediately look a little dated while competitors were slimming down their bezels and offering a more stylish design. Again the Surface Pro 8 has improved on this introducing thinner bezels and a larger display.

The Surface Pro 6 and 7 also weigh roughly the same – 1.7 pounds (771g) for the Surface Pro 6 and very slightly heavier 1.73 pounds (784g) for the Pro 7. The two devices also feature detachable Type Covers for use as laptops (sold separately though you can sometimes save money if you find a bundle with the Type Cover included) and both work with the Surface Pen stylus.

When it comes to ports the two devices offer largely the same selection with a full-size USB-A port (for plugging in older peripherals) a 3.5mm audio port and microSD card reader. This is a welcome addition for photographers as it allows you to plug in memory cards without needing an adapter. Both offer Bluetooth wireless connectivity as well.

Where they differ is that the Surface Pro 6 has a mini DisplayPort. The Surface Pro 7 lacks that but instead offers a USB-C 3.1 port. This allows you to connect modern peripherals and offers much faster data transfer speeds. If we had to choose we’d pick the USB-C over the Mini DisplayPort every time. The Surface Pro 7 Plus still had no Thunderbolt ports while the Surface Pro 8 has introduced two Thunderbolt 4 ports. Those are maintained in the Surface Pro 9 which drops the headphone port.

Verdict: the Surface Pro 7 wins again in Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7 but the Surface Pro 8 is better still.

Surface Pro 6 vs 7: Battery life

With the newer hardware in the Surface Pro 7 you’d think that its better power efficiency would lead to longer battery life. Strangely Microsoft actually lists the battery life of the Surface Pro 6 as longer although it measures the two devices in different ways. According to Microsoft the Surface Pro 6 offers 13.5 hours of 'video playback' while the Surface Pro 7 is capable of 10.5 hours of 'typical device usage'.

However playing videos and 'typical device usage' are two different things so we'd take Microsoft’s comparisons with a pinch of salt. In our own tests when we reviewed the devices the Surface Pro 6 scored 8 hours and 45 minutes running a looped 1080p video. Meanwhile the PC Mark 8 battery life test which replicates day-to-day usage such as video calling lasted just 4 hours.

However the Surface Pro 7 fared worse with just 6 hours and 2 minutes in our video test and 3 hours and 12 minutes in PCMark 8. So rather surprisingly the Surface Pro 6 is the clear winner when it comes to battery life. Yet again the Surface Pro 8 has made an improvement here increasing the battery to 50.4WHr up from 43.2WHr. In our own tests we got over eight hours of medium to heavy use including photo editing and video calling. We found the Surface Pro 9 actually performs slightly worse than the 8 in this area.

Verdict: The Surface Pro 6 won in our tests and actually stands up to the Surface Pro 8

Surface Pro 6 vs 7: Price

The Type Cover and Pen – seen here with the Surface Pro 6 – are sold separately but you may find them in bundles (Image credit: Microsoft)

Both the Surface Pro 6 and Surface Pro 7 come in a variety of configurations which means you can choose the hardware you want to match your needs – and budget. So if you’re on a budget you can tweak either Surface to come with less powerful processors or less storage space to keep the price down.

When the Surface Pro 6 first launched its base configuration was $899 / £879. That’s a hefty asking price but prices have dropped since then following the releases of the Surface Pro 7 Pro 7 Plus and now the Surface Pro 8. It's now usually the most affordable choice by some way and you may find it on offer for as low as $600 / £650 if you find it still in stock (see a list of the best current prices below or check our dedicated page on the best Surface Pro 6 prices).

The Surface Pro 7 launched with a lower base configuration price of $749 / £799 making it better value on launch and it does offer some extra power. The Surface Pro 7+ starts from $899.99 / £879 although it's available for education and business customers only. See our guide to the best Surface Pro 7 deals to find the best prices.

And the Surface Pro 8? It starts from $1099 / £999. That's quite a lot more than its predecessors but it offers a quite a bump in performance and display and there have been quite a lot of discounts about following the release of the Surface Pro 9. The Surface Pro 9 actually starts cheaper in the US – $999 for a Core i5 128GB SSD configuration. That configuration isn't available in the UK. The Core i5 256 GB configuration that's available everywhere retails at $1099 / £1099.

It’s worth noting that none of the devices come with the Type Cover or Surface Pen which means they are an additional $149 / £149 and $99 / £99 respectively so you’ll need to factor those into the overall cost. Take a look at the best prices on all of the current Surface Pro models in your region in the widgets below – or scroll down for our overall verdict.

Verdict: The Surface Pro 6 may win here if you can still find a deal.

Surface Pro 6 vs 7: Deals

Surface Pro 6 vs 7: Our verdict

Is the Surface Pro 7 a big enough leap over the Surface Pro 6? Not really. While the Surface Pro 7 does have newer more powerful components the leap in performance isn't great. And from a design perspective the Surface Pro 7 is pretty much exactly the same as the Surface Pro 6. The older tablet even offers better battery life. If you find it significantly cheaper than the Surface Pro 7 then we'd take advantage to save some money and go for it.

The Surface Pro 7 felt like a bit of a wasted opportunity and if you want something more revolutionary then we'd recommend considering paying that little bit more for the Surface Pro 8. The newest Surface Pro represents a much bigger leap forward from Microsoft – and there was a much greater time interval in between after all. It really offers an improved device across the board with better specs a larger display and a removable SSD.

However for our money the Surface Pro 8 is the clear winner as the best Surface Pro to buy today especially for anyone hoping to use it for more demanding work such as using photo editing apps or other creative programs (you'll probably want one of the higher configurations too). When we take price into consideration then Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7 remains an interesting comparison because these tablets are seeing more regular and deeper discounts (and remember that if you want a keyboard and stylus you'll need to buy them separately which adds to the expense). The gap in time between the release of these two devices was shorter and as a result there's much less of a notable difference..

How old are Surface Pro 6 and Surface Pro 7? If we compare Surface Pro 6 vs Surface Pro 7 on a timeline they weren't very far apart compared with the subsequent generations. The Surface Pro 6 was released in October 2018 so it is getting on a bit now and it's starting to become harder to find deals. The Surface Pro 7 came out just a year later in October 2019. It wasn't until January 2021 that the family spawned a new generation in the form of the Surface Pro 7 Plus an upgraded model aimed only at business customers. That was followed just nine months later by the Surface Pro 8 in October 2021. See how that compares in our comparison of Surface Pro 7 vs Surface Pro 8. Just to make things more confusing there's also the Surface Pro X – you can read about that in our Surface Pro X review.

Given enough time most quality stocks will eventually double triple quadruple and even quintuple their value. That's just how capitalism works. No stock will necessarily reach these milestones at the same time as any other equity though; some will move faster than others.

With that backdrop here's a closer look at three tickers with great shots at turning a $1000 investment today into $5000 as soon as 2030. Notice that each company brings something special to the table at an ideal time.

Monster Beverage

The world needs a serious pick-me-up if the recent sales growth achieved by energy drink outfit Monster Beverage (MNST 0.47%) is any indication. The company's top line is up nearly 16% through the first three quarters of this year extending a span of comparable revenue growth underway for over a decade now. Analysts don't see any real slowdown on the horizon either modeling 11% sales growth next year that's apt to be topped when all is said and done.

Yes Monster Beverage is the outfit behind energy drinks of the same brand name but it's not just Monster. The company also manages Nos Full Throttle Predator and a handful of other energy drink brands. Monster is its flagship though making up the lion's share of its annual top line of around $6 billion.

It's not a lot. But that's the point -- there's room for the entire category to continue growing. And it is. Mordor Intelligence estimates the energy drinks business is on pace to grow by more than 8% per year through 2027 jibing with other growth outlooks for the industry. Monster has something of a secret weapon however helping it win more than its fair share of this growth.

That's Coca-Cola.

Coke has been a Monster stakeholder and partner since 2015. The relationship is still being increasingly leveraged for growth though and yet there's so much more that could be done going forward. Take cannabis for instance. While Coca-Cola doesn't offer cannabis-based drinks right now it is entering new and once-unlikely markets.

For example early this year Coca-Cola entered the alcoholic beverage fray by inking a developmental deal with Constellation Brands...the same Constellation reportedly mulling an acquisition bid for Monster. It's noteworthy simply because Constellation also owns a sizable stake in cannabis company Canopy Growth Corp. and Coca-Cola has at least entertained the possibility of entering the cannabis arena in the recent past.

It's unclear how or if any of these possible combinations and partnerships will shake out. What is clear is that Monster Beverage is well-positioned for whatever the future holds on this front.

Amazon

Perhaps the biggest reason Amazon (AMZN -1.07%) shares could quintuple their current value by 2030 is that shares are down a whopping 46% from last year's peak; simply recovering that loss would mean nearly a 100% gain on its present price. Nevertheless this company's backstory has far more potential than a mere recovery of the stock's recent setback.

This backstory is no longer about e-commerce however.

While selling stuff online remains its biggest business as measured by revenue it's not even close to being its biggest moneymaker. That honor belongs to its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services (AWS). Even prior to this year when soaring expenses dragged its e-commerce operation into the red its cloud computing division was driving roughly two-thirds of its operating income.

The company's cloud computing profitability profile hasn't really changed much since then. It's just grown. AWS' revenue through the first three quarters of this year is up 32% pulling its operating income up 33% with it. In light of Technavio's expectation for annualized growth of 19% for the cloud computing market through 2026 Amazon doesn't necessarily even need its e-commerce business's paper-thin profit margins to be restored to their pre-pandemic levels to continue growing its bottom line at a double-digit pace.

The kicker: Whether or not e-commerce itself is ever profitable again for Amazon may be irrelevant. Its advertising business fueled by the shopping site's traffic is a fast-growing profit center in and of itself. The company did a hefty $9.5 billion ad sales last quarter alone up 25% year over year. And it's still largely learning the advertising business.

AutoZone

Finally add AutoZone (AZO -0.26%) to your list of stocks that could turn $1000 today into $5000 by 2030.

Surprised? As unbelievable as it seems the auto parts and car-care business isn't just consistent but also high-growth. AutoZone's revenue growth of 11% for the fiscal year ending in August is both impressive and in line with the industry's long-term norms. The stock's performance is equally impressive. AutoZone shares are up 50% for the past five years despite their steep (and likely temporary) sell-off since the end of last year and are more than twice their value 10 years ago.

Those are solid numbers but hardly a quintupling. There's good reason to believe the next eight years could prove remarkably more fruitful for AutoZone than the past eight have been however. That's the sheer cost of a new car.

There was a time when consumers recognized that it made more sense to purchase a new automobile than continue spending more and more money just to keep an aging vehicle running. With Kelley Blue Book reporting that the average price for a new car sold in the United States rose to a near-record $48281 in October though the math of the matter changes.

It's once again making increasingly more sense to invest in the automobile you already own -- even more so when the economy is wobbling as it is now. Underscoring this argument is S&P Global's estimate that the average vehicle being driven on U.S. roads is a record-breaking 12.2 years old. While it's a testament to their quality and durability it also suggests they're highly fixable.

It all plays right into the hand AutoZone is holding of course particularly in light of the likelihood that car prices won't be meaningfully dropping anytime soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jim Gillies: This is almost an example I mentioned earlier where they took over a mountain no one else really knew they wanted and you've built a really nicely cash-generative business on top of that. Then as long as management makes good capital allocation choices with the cash they generate you can start getting some pretty decent returns.

[music]

Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill and that's Jim Gillies from Motley Fool Canada. Ricky Mulvey caught up with Jim and his colleague Iain Butler to talk about companies with unusual moats.

Some competitive advantages are well known but let's face it: some economic moats just aren't that obvious like utility poles engineering software even gentlemen's clubs. In this episode Jim and Iain talk about what makes something a moat and the metrics that can reveal a true competitive advantage.

Iain Butler: There's a lot of ways that a company can create a moat but I think that's really what it comes down to it's just your ability to sustain a competitive advantage over a long period of time. Is there any other fancy definition or way of describing it in your mind?

Jim Gillies: One that I like to refer to I'm not sure it's ever been really... the textbooks doesn't get equated to moat. Companies that go after industries that nobody else wants. I think we've got a few examples of that planned for you today but you took control of a mountain no one else knew they wanted. Then at the end of the day you realize oh this company controls this subspace. It doesn't have to be something terribly exciting and sexy like Internet security. Sometimes you can find it in some pretty weird little niche places that no one else realizes wasn't a great opportunity except one or two companies basically go in and seal it up for themselves.

Ricky Mulvey: We're going to get weird in a little bit. Jim I remember in some previous conversations about franchise businesses your personal favorite you said that you're okay paying a higher multiple on a franchise business because you know that it's a reliable check-cashing machine. How does a moat fit in your investing framework and do you ever find yourself saying ""You know what it might be worth paying for this overvalued company on other metrics because it has such a wide moat?""

Jim Gillies: Well one of the best things you can find of course if you can find one of those widening or nascent or super-wide moats if you can find that for the bargain price that's the holy grail. But yeah I'm fine... One of the symptoms of a moat company for me is they can generally have pretty good carte blanche in raising their prices controlling their prices.

We talked briefly before the show one example that I have a private company I know but they can charge pretty much whatever they want because when they talk to their customers there's something like 0.001% of the typical company operating budget so no one's going to care. They're just going to like oh if the supplier company decides to double or triple their price the customers don't really notice.

What ends up happening is moated companies if I can use that as a word moated companies tend to have pretty good pricing power. They tend to be very good cash generators. And then you hope they're good capital allocators of the cash they generate.

Iain Butler: I think just to build a valuation case I'm just trying to think through some examples that I've experienced over the past I think you really have to get into the small-cap world to find a valuation case when it comes to a moat. These megacap companies certainly have moats but valuation outside of crisis times in the market is rarely ever a reason to buy those companies.

Autodesk is one that comes to mind. It's a recommendation that we've made in Stock Advisor Canada. It's in several services across Fooldom. I wouldn't say there's a valuation case for Autodesk but I would say that there's an incredibly strong moat associated with Autodesk which I think in that case can overcome any valuation concerns that one might have.

Ricky Mulvey: Just for some context that's the one that a lot of engineers use where if you're building out a building and you want to make sure that your electrical engineers and your plumbing folks are operating on the same system.

Jim Gillies: This is my engineering ring as the former engineer on the panel let me tell you that the AutoCAD moat is very very real. It is basically all you learn to do and if you want to have portability from one job to another in the engineering space it's all Autodesk it's all AutoCAD.

Ricky Mulvey: It's difficult for the listeners to see. I just saw you sticking a finger up at me and not the other one.

Jim Gillies: You American types don't wear engineering rings but in Canada the engineer is a supposedly solemn ceremony where there's a Rudyard Kipling poem. It's less serious than they make it out to be when you realize when you go in but it's still fairly... It's supposed to be a commitment that engineers will not pass shoddy work will do the best for the public blah blah blah.

Ricky Mulvey: But I would talk about some obvious moats because there's some intro folks out there and I think it's a good way of illustrating how a company becomes essentially a megacap or a larger-cap company by just building either like a balance sheet up or just a vertically integrated system.

When I think of an obvious moat of a company you know I think I would actually go to Live Nation. They own Ticketmaster they own the venues they manage the ticket sales they manage the artists. If Jim Gillies you want to see Death Cab for Cutie it's a very important band it's not like easily substitutable for another jam band like Goose or the Dead and Company. You want to see Death Cab for Cutie you're going through Live Nation.

Jim Gillies: I have gone and I have recently twice.

Ricky Mulvey: Then to your earlier point Iain it's something you're going to pay for. I think right now the stock's trading at about 100 times earnings or something like that. When you think of obvious moats I know you've got one Iain so I'll start with you. What is just an obvious fastball straight-down-the-middle moat that you can think of?

Iain Butler: The company that pops right into mind is only a company that I've come to know over the past year. I suspect that if indeed we have some relatively new investors listening they will not have heard of it. It's a big company I don't have the market cap up handy right now. Dutch company by the name of ASML [Holding].

ASML essentially is the ground floor in the entire global semiconductor industry. They make the machines that go into the manufacturers of semiconductors and they're behind manufacturer semiconductors. Intel as a client Taiwan Semiconductor as a client. All these massive semiconductor companies are reliant on the machines that ASML makes and they have such a lead in technology.

That lead is expanding as each new generation of machine comes out. These are hugely expensive machines I think they're nine-figure machines for one. They sell 30 machines in a year or something like that. I don't even think anybody's even trying to compete with them. They're that far ahead and the capital is so intensive that it just doesn't make sense to compete with them. That's been a company that I've learned about again in the past couple of years that has just blown me away at its competitive strength and the depth of the moat there.

Ricky Mulvey: Let's move to some less obvious ones. I want to talk about pool equipment. You guys countered with rail ties and compressed wood. This is a company that makes utility poles which is a product that is quite literally grown on trees. We're talking about Stella-Jones.

Why is Stella-Jones a company with a hidden moat?

Jim Gillies: Well if you want me to take the first kick at it it's a company that both you and I have recommended on our respective services in Canada. If nothing else we apparently like railway ties and utility poles which of course are there.

Ricky Mulvey: And talking about them.

Jim Gillies: Yeah exactly. But seriously you get railway ties and utility poles. How excited are you? Or what do you call it? I think you Iain call them the national tree of Manitoba or something like that. The utility pole.

Iain Butler: Somebody wants called driving through Nevada on a mining trip once. That's what was pointed out. The telephone pole is the national tree in Nevada or the state tree of Nevada.

Jim Gillies: The state tree of Nevada. But it's a moat for similar reasons to what I discussed earlier where the dollar value of what they're putting in for railways. Railroads are massive massive capital-intensive businesses. That's part of why Buffett when and bought a railway for Berkshire Hathaway because we want to be able to reinvest tremendous amounts of capital at ideally high rates of return.

But to maintain these massive networks is a lot of money per year and the compressed wood the creosote-soaked railway ties there have been pretty much the same since the 1800s? I think I know there's concrete railway ties as well but these are fairly simple fairly localized. There's only a few companies that do this stuff and Stella-Jones happens to be I believe the largest one certainly in North America and they are able to essentially pass along their cost plus in inflationary environments. No one's good about and I lost the big railway company is not going to bat about an eyelash at what Stella-Jones is requiring to have them really happened pay.

You essentially have it's like the water chemistry example. Stella-Jones can push through their price increases maybe a little bit more for their pain and suffering and the railway companies are just going to ""Cool that's fine."" This is not a product that they're going to switch out for a young upstart competitor in the creosote-soaked wood comes along and says ""Hey we'll beat Stella-Jones's prices by 5%."" It's not going to go because you're not going to switch back and forth. They just going to go no.

On the utility side of things quite often municipalities have multiyear contracts with Stella-Jones to keep them supplied with the state tree of Nevada. I've always loved that line. This is a company that they've got products... We're going to get to a better example. But this is almost an example I mentioned earlier where they took over a mountain no one else really knew they wanted and you've built a really nice cash-generative business on top of that and then as long as management makes good capital allocation choices with the cash they generate you can start getting some pretty decent returns.

Ricky Mulvey: Do they have any? I've always seen utility poles as commodity and to be honest I haven't really seen utility poles and thought much of them. Are there any real competitors in this space or is this a market-share leader that has just completely claimed the mountain you just described?

Iain Butler: I think any competitors that are out there are minuscule in relation. They're sort of the big dog in the pound.

Jim Gillies: Yeah we've got a member of a couple of Fool services who we know because we've interacted a couple of times on Twitter and he does work for a competitor of one of like basically they go out and harvest the trees. He's in the tree harvesting business but for a competitor of Stella-Jones and he has only said in our brief conversations he's only had positive things to say about Stella-Jones and remarked on they're a hard company to compete against.

Ricky Mulvey: This is also a company though where growth is fairly predictable. They can project their revenue pretty well I would assume. But it's also a case where the company's valuation has gotten ahead of itself before. For the old retail folks what are the metrics to really watch with this company to make sure they're not paying too much for their utility poles?

Iain Butler: I think that's what's historical I mean so it was one of the best-performing stocks in the Canadian market up until a few years ago when it's flatlined a bit and that's right.

The multiple has historically been very high. It's not high now and it hasn't been high for a couple of years. I think at worst if you just can get this company for its growth prospects alone for consistent as you say predictable revenue stream growing with inflation and whatever else any contractual increases it can make great.

But I think there's a case right now especially when there's potential multiple expansion involved. Like historically it's sort of been at 20- 25-times-earnings type company and here we are half that. I think there's a good total return equation in play right now I think and it's one two where you could probably let it go when it does get more fairly valued. It doesn't necessarily have to be a buy-and-hold-forever type situation despite its competitive position.

Jim Gillies: Yeah. To build on that the valuation I think is really something you want to watch for this moaty company. And I think people should be aware of that they were doing very very well on the Toronto Stock Exchange and they kept on touting that even though it kind of stopped after about 2015. The company itself will put out a press release or a slide deck showing how oh they've beaten the market they beat the S&P 500 they beat the cap industrial index and the S&P TSX and then you look at how they did it. It's like well but that's a 10-year chart. Actually it was a nine-year chart when I was looking at it about a year ago.

And if you lopped off the first two years all of a sudden Stella-Jones went from a market smasher to I think from about March of 2015 through to the end of 2021 I think it's annualized return was about 0.7% because to Iain's point they had gotten out ahead of their skis valuation-wise. They'd become this darling and so people forgot about them and the stock meandered down. And so when we were looking at them and recommended them I don't remember what Iain you put them into Stock Advisor at. But by the time we came along to them and I think we went first in Gems if I'm not mistaken but Iain has talked about 25 times earnings was where these were hovering.

By the time we came along to them I think we're at about 11 times earnings so we got it at a much better price and then as Iain says we're looking for multiple expansions. Not only are they growing earnings and growing revenues and growing cash flows and paying you a higher dividend and buying back stock but maybe if they ever go back to that 25-times multiple we're going to get 100% 150% return on our cost basis just from the multiple expansion. Forget about the business growth. And that maybe doesn't sound great if you go back and look at the 2020 early-2021 growth-stock frenzy.

But historically that's the aberration in the market and we know grows 10% 11% annualized with dividends reinvested. This suddenly becomes a very good argument for buying Stella-Jones at roughly the present valuation level.

Ricky Mulvey: Next company could not be more different. This is a company that operates a chain of strip clubs nightclubs sports bars and restaurants. It's also a media and convention company that serves the adult club industry. It's RCI Hospitality formerly known as Rick's Cabaret.

Jim when you presented this first of all I had to make sure it was okay for us to talk about on the show. But second of all when you presented this I understand how this business is profitable but what I don't understand with RCI Hospitality is how it has a moat when it has quite a few competitors.

Jim Gillies: I'm going to suggest to you not only does it have a moat it's got multiple moats. I do thank you for kind of running it through the proper channels. Because it's a legal business but I obviously understand that there could be disparate opinions about this type of business and so of course no one has to own anything they're not personally morally comfortable with of course.

But in my particular town where I live in Southern Ontario there is one approved location for this type of business. It's actually housed -- it's not owned by RCI but I'm going to I get to why it applies to RCI here. It is owned by an individual. It's in a historically significant house for this town where I live. It's actually in a Heritage building. For the last two decades they've said to the city ""We want to move out to more to the industrial ends of town"" thing and we would sell you the business or sell you the building. And the city says ""We have grandfathered in there will be no more of these types of businesses approved in this town.""

Nothing has happened and the place is still where it has been for decades. That's a kind of moat. Literally if they close or move that service will be gone from the city and that's what's going on for RCI.

They quite often they own the only approved allowed grandfathered-in locale for gentlemen's entertainment club kind of thing. ""Strip club"" sounds so sordid. They literally have a localized government-granted and -enforced moat. They don't have to go out and advertise and try to beat back the competition coming in and setting up across the street from them or across... They're legislated in and so what ends up happening a lot of these things have also been sole proprietorships and RCI is going in and buying up the sole proprietorships or like individual businesses they're buying them up at relatively low valuations because it's another example of it's a mountain no one else realized they wanted. They're buying at 3 4 and 5 times EBITDA when they take over someone looking to sell one of these locales. They go in. They pay a relatively low valuation and they're grandfathered in.

Again whether you agree with the business model or not -- and I certainly can see the arguments on both sides to be honest with you -- there is some value in a localized government-granted moat and one of the best-performing stocks in North America in the past 75 years is Altria aka Philip Morris aka the Marlboro cigarette people. One of the reasons it's been so successful has been the tremendous external pressure against owning companies like that. It's kept it at a low valuation. That company as well they don't have to advertise cigarettes anymore. They don't have a lot of R&D budget. They make a ton of cash. They pay a ton of taxes they make a ton of cash and roll that cash continually into raising their dividend and buying back shares and they do so at a really low valuation because of the external pressure.

And that's what I mean what's unsaid here is since we started looking at RCI Hospitality about two-and-a-half years ago I think the stock... Because that's the same principle coming forward here is I said to Iain in the past this is probably even though given the controversial nature of the business it's probably not one we want to recommend. But I think it's worth looking at for people who don't mind the morality of the business. I think it's worth looking at because I hold RCI Hospitality as it's probably got one of the best and most comprehensive well-thought-out plans for delivering their free cash flow. What they're going to do with their cash in their whole capital allocation stack.

At this price we're going to seek tuck-in acquisitions. At this price we're going to seek dividends dividend hikes maybe a special dividend. At this price we're going to be looking to buy back shares. And I think they've done really really well. The CEO he was a big fan of the book The Outsiders which is all about capital allocation and rock-star companies that have done well with it. And he read that about five or six years ago and I think he embraced it as how he wants to run RCI Hospitality.

And so again you're focused where there's a lot of real good positives that we would like with a lot of stocks in the Foolish universe. But there is that business that maybe no one else wants and so you go that's an interesting combination to me.

Ricky Mulvey: It's a company you want to ask questions about and Glassdoor ratings are always something that can be juiced and you want to look with a more critical eye especially for a smaller-cap companies. 94% of employees would recommend working there to a friend. If this is your space it sounds like it has an incredibly high employee score I would say.

Let's move on to some final questions. I think the thing about moats and you were talking about this earlier with some companies is they can end up being stocks that you own but don't really pay attention to. And that's exactly the case with a company like Pool Corp. which is not selling pool supplies to consumers but rather businesses and it's not a stock I own but it's 20 times larger than its second competitor and that would give it I would say a pretty strong vote in a space in a hill that not too many people else are at or on.

Jim Gillies: Yeah. It's definitely I think I said before I actually own it and yeah I couldn't tell you the last time I went and looked at their filings. Just because it's not one that I worry too much about. I would encourage people who are interested in Pool Corp. go have a look at their historical returns how they've done in terms of returns on capital and then what they've delivered to shareholders. It's been -- to long-term shareholders. Again this is not something that you should be jumping in and out of I think. Iain?

Iain Butler: Actually you just raised a question that I threw into our notes ahead. Do either of you key on a specific metric to provide some indicate that a moat might be present? Is there is there any one number that you look to and go this is an interesting competitive situation potentially.

Ricky Mulvey: I'm honored you asked me but I have no idea. I'm going to punt this to Jim.

Jim Gillies: I'm going to say no disappointingly. I'm a cash flow guy so I look at cash.

Iain Butler: I think that's the answer. The two that came to mind when I was asking myself that question as I was looking at some of these companies that we threw into the air I think an improving margin is one. An improving operating margin indicates pricing power potentially and the ability to sort of get more out of your customers and what you're having to put into them cost-wise. I wonder about return on equity as well. Like a high return on equity might be an indication.

Jim Gillies: Maybe more return on capital. Because especially in a world where we've seen a lot of companies blow up their balance sheets with buybacks and yet that's going to keep your equity account low and it's going to float your ROE higher. Maybe more of a return-on-capital thing I would argue for.

Iain Butler: But I think that maybe the message then is it's a mosaic approach. There's no real like one thing that any of us are going to point to and go boom! Moat. It's like you got to understand the business.

Jim Gillies: I love the ""mosaic approach"" analogy. That's very Charlie Monger review. I think that's where I first heard that and I think that's great.

However the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

Recent earnings growth for Apple has been in line with the market. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this modest earnings performance will accelerate. If not then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.

Keen to find out how analysts think Apple's future stacks up against the industry? In that case our free report is a great place to start.

Does Growth Match The High P/E?

In order to justify its P/E ratio Apple would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.

If we review the last year of earnings growth the company posted a worthy increase of 8.7%. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 110% in total over the last three years. Therefore it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.

Shifting to the future estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 5.4% per annum over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.1% growth each year the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.

In light of this it's alarming that Apple's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.

The Bottom Line On Apple's P/E

Generally our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.

We've established that Apple currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.

Having said that be aware Apple is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis you should know about.

People in developed countries tend to take infrastructure for granted because they've grown up in countries and cities which have top infrastructure be it railroads roads bridges tunnels or even telecom. However only a small privileged percentage of the total global population enjoys this kind of security with most developing nations struggling to build even basic durable infrastructure which is also intrinsic to the success of any nation's economy.

The railroad in the U.S. is integral to continuing operations in the country and a shutdown would cause billions of dollars' worth of damage. All four of the major railroads in the country three of which are in our list of the top infrastructure companies in US reported some form of records profits in the previous year.

There are several issues which have governed the current railroad crisis which is threatening to spiral out of control. Railroad workers are governed under the Railway Labor Act which imposes restrictions on when unions can strike as opposed to most other unions in the country which are under no such obligation. Because of a breakdown in negotiations where railway management and the unions couldn't agree on a new deal President Biden ordered the unions to not go on strike and instead engage in a 60-day cooling off period as both sides would present proposals to the President in order to reach a better deal. At the forefront of this issue is sick leaves.

On the 1st of December 2022 the Senate rejected a proposal which would give railroad workers seven days of paid sick leaves. Immediately after President Biden signed a bill which would prevent the railroad workers from striking as that would devastate the country's economy.

The top infrastructure companies in the U.S. are giants of the industry providing employment to hundreds of thousands of people while recording hundreds of billions in revenue in total. To determine these companies we have considered their market cap revenue profit and assets assigning 30% weightage to the first three criteria and 10% to the last one.

Here is what Headwaters Capital had to say about Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) was founded in 1999 and provides vulnerability management software to both SMBs and enterprise customers. Vulnerability management software provides a continuous view of security and compliance across all of a company’s assets including on-premise end-points cloud and mobile. The easiest way to think about QLYS’s original VM solution is that it provided a dashboard that monitored all potential threats to a network and helped IT departments prioritize which vulnerabilities were the highest risk. QLYS was a pioneer in the industry as they were one of the first companies to offer a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) solution as opposed to the traditional license offerings that proliferated at the time. While QLYS’ VM software has always provided an industry leading dashboard to monitor weaknesses it provided limited functionality to respond to these vulnerabilities. More recently QLYS has increased the functionality of its software through the rollout of Detection and Response capabilities (VMDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities in late 2021. The cybersecurity space has been marked by a preference of customers for point solution expertise as opposed to a winner take all solution. This market structure is driven by the complex nature of assets that need protection the dynamic nature of security threats and the critical nature of cybersecurity which leads to a customer preference for quality over cost. Historically cybersecurity was best served by firewalls which provided a ring fence around assets that were physically located on a network. Firewalls are increasingly becoming obsolete in the cybersecurity world as the network perimeter has effectively disappeared due to the growing adoption of SaaS solutions and new connected devices that connect to the network from multiple new endpoints. This trend has only accelerated following COVID. As more devices and software tools connect from outside of the traditional firewall perimeter the importance of security monitoring tools such as VM VMDR and XDR has increased. In many ways vulnerability management is the foundation of cybersecurity as it provides the dashboard for monitoring all potential security gaps. QLYS’ software can provide critical data about which assets are exposed to specific threats and can increasingly help IT departments prioritize and remediate these vulnerabilities. Understanding QLYS’s history is important to gaining confidence in QLYS’ ability to maintain revenue growth going forward. QLYS was almost perfectly positioned earlier this decade to take advantage of both the transition in the software market from license to SaaS solutions as well as the cybersecurity trend away from firewalls as devices increasingly moved beyond a physical perimeter. Given the large TAM industry tailwinds and a market leading product QLYS was able to growth revenues at a +20% CAGR from 2012-2018. Even more impressive QLYS was able to accomplish this growth with limited investment in R&D or its sales force. R&D as a percentage of revenues declined from 22% in 2012 to 16% in 2018 while S&M declined from 40% in 2012 to 22% in 2018. Consequently QLYS operates with one of the highest EBITDA margins in the industry at 45%. The ability for QLYS to post such consistent revenue growth despite under-investing in product development and sales is evidence of the strong competitive positioning of QLYS’ software and the critical nature of the product…” (Click here to read more)

Here is what Upslope Capital had to say about CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) provides specialized technology and consulting services primarily to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. The U.S. Army is CACI’s single largest customer. This position replaces BWXT in Upslope’s “defense basket” (articulated in Q1 on p. 4). CACI’s business is mostly split across Expertise (providing talent to government agencies – e.g. software engineers) and Technology (design and delivery of specific technology-oriented services and products including for example battlefield hardware). The company offers its services and products in support of both day-to-day agency operations and specific missions. At a high-level CACI reminds me of another Upslope long in an unrelated sector: Silgan Holdings (packaging/dispensing and food can business). Both are truly sleepy value stocks that trade for low doubledigit earnings multiples but have a strong history of steady value creation and free cash flow per share growth. Both the stocks and underlying businesses appear very well-positioned for the uncertain macro (or geopolitical in CACI’s case) environment we’re likely to face in the years ahead. Other notable thesis points for CACI specifically:

Long-term Geopolitical & Other Tailwinds – like other components of Upslope’s defense basket CACI should benefit from an attractive defense spending environment for years to come. CACI should also benefit from IT modernization efforts in U.S. government agencies as well as its strength in cyber/electronic warfare offerings…” (Click here to read the full text)

(NASDAQ:TMUS) A Quality Stock?,"One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine T-Mobile US Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) by way of a worked example.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

See our latest analysis for T-Mobile US

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for T-Mobile US is:

2.2% = US$1.5b ÷ US$70b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has the company made $0.02 in profit.

Does T-Mobile US Have A Good ROE?

By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly this is far from a perfect measure because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below T-Mobile US has a lower ROE than the average (6.4%) in the Wireless Telecom industry classification.

roe

That certainly isn't ideal. That being said a low ROE is not always a bad thing especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. To know the 4 risks we have identified for T-Mobile US visit our risks dashboard for free.

How Does Debt Impact ROE?

Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings issuing new shares (equity) or debt. In the first and second cases the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case the debt used for growth will improve returns but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.

T-Mobile US' Debt And Its 2.2% ROE

T-Mobile US does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.05. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.

Conclusion

Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal a higher ROE is better.

But when a business is high quality the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.

Of course T-Mobile US may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.

Pandemic War Helped AI Market Expand

The global AI market has benefited from two major global events that have led to slowdowns in other industries namely the global pandemic of 2020 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The former led to increased demand for AI products as more businesses shifted towards digital work models while the latter increased global government spending on AI software for defense especially in European countries in close proximity to Russia. News publication Bloomberg has forecast a more than 35% annual growth rate for AI in the coming five years.

It is estimated that North America led the global artificial intelligence market in the past few years accounting for about 43 percent of overall revenue in 2021 alone. AI services in major sectors such as healthcare manufacturing and automotive in nations like China Japan South Korea and Australia has fueled AI expansion in the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover the expanding applications and simple deployment techniques have drawn governments and private organizations to AI technology as well.

Some of the top firms working in the AI sector include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). However investors must also be wary of certain complications related to the new technology. Firstly AI is a complicated system so the firms working in the space need employees with certain skill sets to create manage and deploy AI systems. These skills demand higher wages. Secondly workers working with AI systems need varied understandings in deep learning and cognitive computing.

A 14-year-old Palestinian girl nursing dreams of breaking out of the traditional gender expectations of her village to attend school at a nearby city is forced into hiding by her father after their quiet settlement is attacked by soldiers of the newly created Israeli Defense Forces. Hiding inside a locked pantry while waiting for her father to return she watches through a small opening in the wall as Israeli soldiers execute a Palestinian family — including two young children and a baby.

Filmmaker Darin Sallam’s debut “Farha” is also the Jordanian entry for the 2023 Academy Awards. Sallam has said that the movie is based on the true story of a friend of her mother who living years later as a refugee in Syria recalled her experience as a young girl during the Nakba. Sallam describes the film as a means of helping process a painful memory of that time.

“I’m not afraid to tell the truth. We need to do this because films live and we die” Sallam said in an interview last winter following the film’s premiere at the Red Sea International Film Festival. “This is why I decided to make this film. Not because I’m political but because I’m loyal to the story that I heard.”

Cancel Campaigns

Predictably the film — and the attention that it is now getting on a major platform like Netflix — has angered Israeli officials who have denounced “Farha” and even threatened consequences for its airing.

“It’s crazy that Netflix decided to stream a movie whose whole purpose is to create a false pretense and incite against Israeli soldiers” outgoing Israeli Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman said in a recent statement. Lieberman also took steps to revoke state funding to a theatre in the Tel Aviv suburb of Jaffa that screened the film with the “goal of preventing the screening of this shocking film or other similar ones in the future.”

Various other Israeli officials have denounced the production of “Farha” in public statements. In response to its screening on Netflix there has been coordinated downvoting of its ratings online as well as a social media campaign calling on people to cancel their Netflix subscriptions.

Many people do not want “Farha” to be seen under any circumstance. Yet this attempt to shut down screenings of the film seems to reflect an unfair denial of yet another basic human right to Palestinians: the ability to process their trauma through art. Rather than gratuitously attack Israelis the creator of “Farha” has said that this personal impulse was at the core of why the film was created.

“The story traveled over the years to reach me. It stayed with me. When I was a child I had this fear of closed dark places and I kept thinking of this girl and what happened to her” Sallam said following the film’s release. “So when I grew up and became a filmmaker I decided that this would be my debut feature.”

The desire to use art as a means of dealing with pain — including historical traumas passed down through generations — should be familiar to Israelis many of whom are descendants of genocide survivors from Europe about which there is a voluminous history of cultural production continuing into the present day.

Despite the documented fact of the Palestinian refugee exodus the individual accounts of those who suffered these events have often been suppressed only recently receiving halting recognition from the broader public decades after the fact. The Palestinian film industry which has achieved popular success in recent years has emerged as a vital tool for capturing the historical memory not just of the Nakba but of the continued traumas suffered by millions of Palestinians living as occupied subjects of the Israeli military.

Acknowledging the Other Side

The pivotal scene in “Farha” showing the murder of a Palestinian family depicts the wartime Israeli military in a poor light. Yet far from being unthinkable such incidents have been documented by Israeli historians as common during the Nakba.

“The Jewish soldiers who took part in the massacre also reported horrific scenes: babies whose skulls were cracked open women raped or burned alive in houses and men stabbed to death” the historian Ilan Pappe wrote in his book “The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine” describing accounts of a massacre that took place in the Palestinian village of Dawaymeh.

Despite attempts to shut down its production there is a strong case to make that “Farha” should be seen.

The massacre in Dawaymeh was just one of countless incidents of ethnic cleansing during this period many of which have survived in the memory of Palestinians but are only now being recognized by others.

That the people who suffered through the Nakba and their children have a right to memorialize their experience through art should not be denied even if as is likely the stories they tell make some people uncomfortable in the present day.

“Farha” is now available to millions of people to watch on Netflix. Despite attempts to shut down its production there is a strong case to make that it should be seen — though not to deepen hatred over terrible events that cannot be reversed. Rather the film should stand as an acknowledgement of the other side of a historic story about the creation of the state of Israel that has too long been ignored or denied: the story of its victims.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bHRhc3NpLzIwMjIvMTIvMDQvd2VkbmVzZGF5LXNlYXNvbi0xLXJldmlldy1qZW5uYS1vcnRlZ2EtaGFyZC1jYXJyaWVzLW5ldGZsaXhzLW5ldy1tZWdhaGl0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Wednesday' Season 1 Review: Jenna Ortega Hard Carries Netflix's New Megahit,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/12/04/wednesday-season-1-review-jenna-ortega-hard-carries-netflixs-new-megahit/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bHRhc3NpLzIwMjIvMTIvMDQvd2VkbmVzZGF5LXNlYXNvbi0xLXJldmlldy1qZW5uYS1vcnRlZ2EtaGFyZC1jYXJyaWVzLW5ldGZsaXhzLW5ldy1tZWdhaGl0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wNC9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2Jlbi1hZmZsZWNrLW5ldGZsaXgtYXNzZW1ibHktbGluZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8xMi8wNC9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2Jlbi1hZmZsZWNrLW5ldGZsaXgtYXNzZW1ibHktbGluZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ben Affleck says Netflix's 'assembly line' approach to making quality films is 'an impossible job',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cnn.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/12/04/entertainment/ben-affleck-netflix-assembly-line/index.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C4909FDAE0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wNC9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2Jlbi1hZmZsZWNrLW5ldGZsaXgtYXNzZW1ibHktbGluZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8xMi8wNC9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2Jlbi1hZmZsZWNrLW5ldGZsaXgtYXNzZW1ibHktbGluZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9uZXRmbGl4LWtlZXBzLW1ha2luZy1hLWh1Z2UtbWlzdGFrZS1kaXNuZXktZG9lc2500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix Doesn't Understand Its Biggest Problem (Disney Does),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/netflix-keeps-making-a-huge-mistake-disney-doesnt on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9uZXRmbGl4LWtlZXBzLW1ha2luZy1hLWh1Z2UtbWlzdGFrZS1kaXNuZXktZG9lc2500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Dubbed: “Mobilising for Peace and Cohesion” (MPC) the project is being implemented by the CAPECS in 18 communities-eight communities in the Sissala West District and 10 communities in the Wa West District.

The 10-month project also seeks to increase women’s engagement and their involvement in the peace-building process and community development through their effective participation in local development committees.

“This is an issue that came up in the Sissala West District during our engagement with the women groups. Women’s involvement in the local development committees is very low” Mr Abu Alhassan Dokuwie the Executive Director of CAPECS explained.

He was speaking in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) in Wa on the project implementation and its potential impact on the development of the beneficiary communities the region and the country at large.

The European Union (EU) is providing funding support for the MPC project through COGINTA under its “Preventing Electoral Violence and Providing Security to the Northern Border Regions of Ghana” (NORPREVSEC) programme.

Mr Dokuwie said the project was aimed “at contributing to the prevention of violent extremism and promoting peaceful farmer-pastoralist co-existence in border communities in the Wa West and Sissala West Districts of the Region.”

He added that its objective was to raise awareness of 40 women groups and 40 youth camps in the 18 communities in the two districts on the root causes of violence and the dangers of using violence as a conflict resolution mechanism as well as promote dialogue between farmers and pastoralists to enhance social cohesion.

Mr Dokuwie said they had so far held inception engagement with the project districts and communities to inform the stakeholders and communities of the project strategy and to seek their support in its implementation to enable it yield the needed results.

Mr Mustapha Sinto the Monitoring and Evaluation Officer of CAPECS observed that peace and cohesion were unalienable determiners in the development of every community.

He explained that women and the youth were pivotal in promoting sustainable development in communities hence the focus of the project on women and youth groups.

He indicated that they would among other things engage in rigorous public sensitisation on issues of counter-terrorism and farmer-herder conflict as they were distractors of peace and cohesion in the communities.

The beneficiary communities included: Gwollu Jawia Kusali and Fielimon communities among others in the Sissala West District and Dorimon and Talawona communities among others in the Wa West District.",,,

A year after her father-in-law left the White House Lara Trump pursued a new line of work as a paid contributor to the Fox News network. At the time she was welcomed with open arms according to The Guardian; one of the network hosts greeted her with ""Welcome to the family Lara."" She in turn replied that she had already been interviewed on Fox ""so often that the security guards were like 'Maybe we should just give you a key.'""

Now that those family relations have cooled Lara will have to return that key. According to the Los Angeles Times and other outlets Fox News has ""parted ways"" with Lara the wife of former first son Eric Trump.

Swimming Australia (SA) confirmed receipt of the letter in response to questions from reporter Julian Linden in an Australian Daily Telegraph exclusive today.

The letter is signed by every state swimming association president in the country plus the Northern Territory as well as the national swimmer’s union and coaches and teachers’ association ASCTA. Basically just about everyone representing everyone that matters.

It’s just a couple of weeks since one of the legends of swimming Tracy (nee Caulkins) Stockwell lost the presidency at Swimming Australia in a vote underpinned by a crisis in management of one of the national federation of the most successful women’s swimming team in the world at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

Linden writes in the Telegraph that “Australia’s signature sport is on the brink of mutiny because of an ongoing power struggle that’s trickled down from the highest levels right to the grassroots”. Swimming is a sport on “the verge of a full-blown revolt” Down Under.

News Corp got a copy of what was sent as a confidential letter to SA’s board of directors calling for urgent review from stakeholders saying they have lost faith in the way their sport is being managed. The explosive letter includes:

“It is our view the current culture and behaviours from the Swimming Australia executive do not align with stated values and strategic objectives.” Swimming Australia stakeholders – Photo: Australia is the world’s biggest wave in women’s swimming – pictured Cate Campbell in full flow (- by Patrick B. Kraemer / MAGICPBK

The Telegraph reports that some of the biggest movers and shakers swimming – all speaking on the condition of anonymity because they fear repercussions for going public – “have expressed major reservations about the leadership style of new chief executive Eugenie Buckley” who took over from another swim legend Alex Baumann when he stepped down suddenly last year on grounds of health.

The letter follows a a lead-balloon of a memo from Buckley to all the swim states and territories notifying them that their participation growth funding was being hacked in half for the next financial year. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back for stakeholders aware that Swimming Australia had lost the long-term and lucrative funding it had from Georgina Rinehart Executive Chairman of Hancock Prospecting a privately-owned mineral exploration and extraction company. Rinehart is Australia’s richest person her wealth reaching around A$29 billion in 2012 which at the time made her the world’s richest woman. She was listed by Forbes on its World’s 100 Most Powerful Women.

Rinehart recently withdrew funding from Swimming Australia while continuing to offer direct support for swimmers. Her precise reasons have not been divulged but stakeholders have indicated that there have been concerns over the difference between what they see as governing in the best interests of swimmers and governing on the basis of prevailing political issues and agendas in society at large. The transgender issue for example is one of those issues where sport and society cannot be treated in the same way because male advantage in female sport breaks the rules of Fair Play and sex-based discrimination.

Linden reports that SA’s latest financial statement shows a net loss of AUS$2.21 million.

Meanwhile Buckley previously in charge of Netball Queensland was hired initially by SA on an interim basis but landed the role permanently on January 1 this year “despite some board members apparently unaware she was being sued by a director at her former job” Linden reports.

University professor Marie Kavanagh commenced legal action against Buckley Netball Queensland and its company secretary and general manager of corporate services Ana Croger for allegedly defaming her. The case is ongoing.

SA’s new president Michelle Gallen who was voted in over Stockwell confirmed the board had received the letter and would meet with the aggrieved state representatives.

“Our States all have such diverse needs and diverse memberships” she told News Corp.

The crisis has erupted on the eve of the World short-course championships that get underway in Melbourne on December 13.

Gallen told Linden that the meeting with stakeholders would go ahead during the world titles.

Her predecessor Kieren Perkins replaced John Bertrand as president in late 2020 but announced just a year later he was stepping down to take on a bigger role running the Australian Sports Commission.

The Fox Corp.-backed network confirmed Saturday that Trump wife to President Donald Trump‘s younger son Eric was no longer an official contributor to the network which hired her in the role in the spring of 2021.

“We appreciate Lara’s valuable contributions across Fox News Media programming” the company said in a statement. Fox News’ decision was previously reported by The Los Angeles Times.

Fox News has long maintained a policy that prohibits people from being contributors when they announce a campaign for public office. In this case since Donald Trump has announced his intention to run once again for president the network’s rules bar Lara Trump from being paid for her commentary. She could conceivably appear on the air in an unpaid capacity as she did when Donald Trump ran during the 2020 campaign.

Popular on Variety

She exits the role as many media outlets backed by Rupert Murdoch appear to have soured on Donald Trump. He has been criticized in recent months by the editorial pages of both The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. Both are published by News Corp. a corporate sibling to Fox Corp. Both companies are controlled by the Murdoch family.

Even some Fox News outlets which have not targeted Trump in recent months have been harsh toward the former president. Last month Lara Trump appeared on Fox Business Network after her father-in-law announced his candidacy for the 2024 election. Anchor Stuart Varney told her that “I’m sure you’re very supportive of your father-in-law but to those of us on the outside looking at it it didn’t seem as though he’s got the old magic you know what I mean?” Lara Trump pushed back: “Oh well I highly disagree with that.”

Her contributor role had long been something to monitor. When she joined Fox News in an official capacity in 2021 she was considering running for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L29ubGluZS9zb2NpYWwvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXNheXMtcmlzay1vZi1oaXMtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbi1pcy1xdWl0ZS1zaWduaWZpY2FudC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzcyNzk3ZDY0ZjVmNjZkODg4NjE3Njc4YTcwNTdlYWIx0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvb25saW5lL3NvY2lhbC9lbG9uLW11c2stc2F5cy1yaXNrLW9mLWhpcy1hc3Nhc3NpbmF0aW9uLWlzLXF1aXRlLXNpZ25pZmljYW50L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzI3OTdkNjRmNWY2NmQ4ODg2MTc2NzhhNzA1N2VhYjE_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Significant’: Musk’s assassination claim,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/elon-musk-says-risk-of-his-assassination-is-quite-significant/news-story/72797d64f5f66d888617678a7057eab1 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L29ubGluZS9zb2NpYWwvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXNheXMtcmlzay1vZi1oaXMtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbi1pcy1xdWl0ZS1zaWduaWZpY2FudC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzcyNzk3ZDY0ZjVmNjZkODg4NjE3Njc4YTcwNTdlYWIx0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvb25saW5lL3NvY2lhbC9lbG9uLW11c2stc2F5cy1yaXNrLW9mLWhpcy1hc3Nhc3NpbmF0aW9uLWlzLXF1aXRlLXNpZ25pZmljYW50L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzI3OTdkNjRmNWY2NmQ4ODg2MTc2NzhhNzA1N2VhYjE_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxpc3QuY29tLzExMjYxMDcvd2h5LWxhcmEtdHJ1bXAtaXMtc3VkZGVubHktb3V0LW9mLWEtam9iLWF0LWZveC1uZXdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Lara Trump Is Suddenly Out Of A Job At Fox News,"Why Lara Trump Is Suddenly Out Of A Job At Fox News

A year after her father-in-law left the White House Lara Trump pursued a new line of work as a paid contributor to the Fox News network. At the time she was welcomed with open arms according to The Guardian; one of the network hosts greeted her with ""Welcome to the family Lara."" She in turn replied that she had already been interviewed on Fox ""so often that the security guards were like 'Maybe we should just give you a key.'""

Now that those family relations have cooled Lara will have to return that key. According to the Los Angeles Times and other outlets Fox News has ""parted ways"" with Lara the wife of former first son Eric Trump. A representative for Fox made a brief public statement: ""We appreciate Lara's valuable contributions across Fox News Media programming."" So why has Lara parted ways with the network? It seems there is a conflict of interest issue.

The letter follows a a lead-balloon of a memo from Buckley to all the swim states and territories notifying them that their participation growth funding was being hacked in half for the next financial year.

Newly leaked imagery of a rumored Off-White x Nike Air Terra Forma collab was shared by @wxj6550822 on Instagram. According to sources this silhouette is an original design from the late Off-White founder Virgil Abloh said to be his first from-scratch collaboration with Nike.

The shoe features a mid-top construction on the upper along with a zipper shroud on the Off-White-branded tongue. The name of the previously unseen model is stamped on the medial portion while a DIY style Swoosh appears on the sides. The shoe’s standout design is the unique tooling featuring the text “Nike Air Inner Space” at the midfoot and a visible Max Air unit on the heel.

For the upcoming “Year Of The Rabbit” festivities in 2023 Nike is looking back to the last occurrence of the zodiac animal for some inspiration.

That would be in 2011 when Nike Sportswear dropped one of the best “Year Of The…” Air Force 1s in history. Inspired by a traditional milk cream-flavored candy popular in China the original Air Force 1 “Year Of The Rabbit” features a white red and blue colorway to match the signature candy wrapper. The fully opaque outsole mimicked the translucence of the candy itself while the chenille materials on the Swoosh and tongue logos were set to represent the furry nature of the rabbit. Retail price was set at $250 while a Friends And Family edition with special packaging landing in the hands of the world’s foremost collectors and VIPs.

For 2023 Nike is transferring the same colors and details to the Dunk Low. This first look at official images reveals the same use of colors and materials on the uppers but with the added rabbit logo on the heel pressed into the leather. The outsole also calls out the connection to the AF1 as the left sole boldly states 2011 while the opposite shoe reveals a 2023.

The Nike Dunk Low “Year Of The Rabbit” is expected to release in January 2023; see the first look at official images below. For now you can look back on 2011’s Air Force 1 “Year Of The Rabbit”."

The agreement gives rail workers a pay raise and other benefits but not paid medical leave. I spoke to my colleague Peter S. Goodman who covers supply chains about what’s behind the workers’ discontent.

Ian: The deal that Congress enforced is one that the Biden administration helped negotiate earlier this year which several unions rejected. Why were they against it?

Peter: The lack of paid sick leave caused the workers I spoke with to vote it down that and draconian scheduling policies. Rail workers are constantly missing wedding anniversaries funerals birthday parties. It’s baked into the job. But in addition to that there’s pressure to be at the job site even when they’ve got emergencies or sick children.

Here’s an example. I talked to a guy named Anthony Gunter who’s based in eastern Tennessee and worked on maintenance crews repairing tracks for Norfolk Southern Railway. His dad had worked there for 40 years and Gunter remembers trying to sneak into his duffel bag as a kid to join him on the road. Gunter regularly worked four 10-hour shifts in a row swinging giant hammers pounding stakes into railroad ties. His son had been born with a heart defect and last year he stayed home for his son’s surgery. His supervisor pressured him to come back saying: “You’re putting me in a tough spot. You have to be here.” Gunter was furious so he quit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvcG9saWNlLTE4LXBlb3BsZS1hcnJlc3RlZC1hZnRlci1wb2xpY2UtaW4tbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtYnVzdC1yZXRhaWwtdGhlZnQtcmluZy9hcnRpY2xlXzg2MGU1Y2MwLWViZTctNTAxMi1hYTMzLWViOTg4YTE5Y2ExNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police: 18 people arrested after police in Los Angeles bust retail theft ring,"Memphis TN (38111)

Northern Homes Community Development Corporation were able to begin construction on these homes with funding from Charlevoix State Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis.

“It is a very tricky balance to get any project started and then adding the complication of trying to make it affordable for local residents makes it even harder to get projects so that they financially work and to be able to move forward on them. So we're super excited that this one is finally ready to go” Northern Homes Executive Director Jane Mackenzie said.

The homes will be sold to households earning less than 80 percent of the area median income which is about $63000 per year for a family of four. The properties will be part of the Northern Homes Community Land Trust program which ensures the homes are owner-occupied year-round and keeps the homes affordable for the next family.

“It's a really great tool the Community Land Trust tool. It's existed for a long time and I'm really happy to share it as an opportunity for the community to really put some energy behind and say ‘Hey this is a great way for us to hold space for our own community and our workforce’” said Andrea Jacobs director for the Housing North Emmet County Housing Ready Program.

Over the winter months some components of the homes will be panelized meaning they will be constructed indoors and then assembled on-site. Unlike modular homes these homes are stick-built and constructed locally.

Each home will have three bedrooms and two full bathrooms but will have different designs and layouts. They are close to Bear River and walking distance from downtown Petoskey.

Northern Homes is currently accepting applications for the homes. Potential buyers will go through the homebuyer education program so that those who don’t qualify will still get something out of the process and can also receive assistance qualifying for mortgages from Northern Homes.

These homes will serve as models for future projects. Northern Homes is hoping to start construction on five homes in Boyne City next year and are currently working on bringing an apartment complex to Charlevoix County.

Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) and the U.S. Air Force unveiled the B-21 Raider to the world. A marvel of advanced digital manufacturing technologies across the entire spectrum the B-21 joins the nuclear triad as a visible and flexible deterrent designed for the U.S. Air Force to meet its most complex missions. It is no secret that Northrop Grumman has put additive manufacturing at the top of its list of key enabling technologies. It is at the heart of the company’s advanced manufacturing strategy and its investments in the AM field have continued to grow topping $70 million just for parts acquired from external suppliers.

To be clear Northrop Grumman’s use of 3D printing dates back to long before this program and the relative scale-up of AM adoption. In fact the company was among the very first to implement AM for rapid prototyping shortly after the technology was invented. Boris Fritz who headed the Rapid Prototyping Lab at Northrop Grumman for 17 years started it in 1991 and worked on the first major application with Ed Hobart: a high lift wing wind tunnel model produced using stereolithography which reduced the cost from $450000 down to $12000 (and goth them the first of four world excellence awards in the early AMUG shows).

The B-21 program is super secretive. Since the contract award in 2015 Northrop Grumman has assembled a nationwide team to design test and build the world’s most advanced strike aircraft. The B-21 is a product of Northrop Grumman’s pioneering digital engineering practices and advanced manufacturing techniques together with breakthrough stealth technology.

“We have been flying additive[ly] manufactured parts since 2005. We have around 5000 3D printed parts altogether in our air vehicles” said Eric Barnes Northrop Grumman Fellow for Additive Manufacturing not long ago. During his 32 years tenure at the company Mr. Barnes has led the development implementation and strategy for polymer and metallic additive manufacturing on multiple air and space vehicles leveraging over 36 years of experience in materials processes and manufacturing research and development implementation design and production support with particular expertise in Composite structures for aerospace applications.

We have been flying additive[ly] manufactured parts since 2005. We have around 5000 3D printed parts altogether in our air vehicles Eric Barnes Northrop Grumman Fellow for Additive Manufacturing

The Raider was developed to provide the US Air Force with long-range high survivability and mission payload flexibility. In order to do so the B-21 Raider will have to be able to penetrate the toughest defenses for precision strikes anywhere in the world. These advanced stealth capabilities are made possible by advanced manufacturing as Northrop Grumman is continuously advancing technology employing new manufacturing techniques and materials to ensure the B-21 will defeat the anti-access area-denial systems it will face

Advanced manufacturing involves materials that have been designed to meet specific objectives. For example in some situations you may need a durable material while in others you may prioritize flexibility. In aerospace engineers evaluate materials based on many factors such as the ability to handle extreme temperatures and electrostatic discharge.

“We are now using five different additive manufacturing materials in our products – more when considering tooling” says Barnes. He added that they are investigating additional materials that can’t yet be announced. These materials include ESD PEKK 3D printed via HexAM a modified SLS technology on EOS machines made available by Hexcel. ESD PEKK enables the production of electrically dissipative parts with discontinuous carbon fibers something that is particularly useful in aircraft that cannot dissipate electrostatics into the ground.

Engineers have a variety of options depending on their program’s requirements. “The choice of material depends on the requirements and the cost-benefit” Barnes says. He also explained that polymers are a cost-effective option for many applications but in scenarios such as supersonic aircraft that get hotter than 300 degrees Fahrenheit a metal such as titanium is often the right choice.

Another important aspect of advanced manufacturing is the digital component. The B-21 is considered a “digital bomber”. To build it Northrop Grumman uses agile software development advanced manufacturing techniques and digital engineering tools to help mitigate production risk on the B-21 program and enable modern sustainment practices. Six B-21 Raiders are in various stages of final assembly and test at Northrop Grumman’s plant in Palmdale California which means they are manufactured on US soil.

“The Northrop Grumman team develops and delivers technology that advances science looks into the future and brings it to the here and now” said Kathy Warden Chair Chief Executive Officer and President Northrop Grumman. “The B-21 Raider defines a new era in technology and strengthens America’s role of delivering peace through deterrence.”

From 3D printing rocket motors to using advanced materials to produce aircraft parts the company uses AM across the enterprise having invested more than $70 million in AM with more than 5000 AM parts currently integrated into the company’s aeronautic platforms all produced by small- and medium-sized suppliers and partners. The company also currently collaborates with several universities and colleges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL21pbGl0YXJ5L2ItMjEtcmFpZGVyLXN0cmF0ZWdpYy1zdGVhbHRoLWJvbWJlci1wdWJsaWMtZGVidXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,B-21 Raider strategic stealth bomber makes its public debut,"In a presentation long on stagecraft and short on hard facts Northrop Grumman has revealed the US Air Force's long-anticipated B-21 Raider stealth nuclear strategic bomber which will replace all other heavy bombers in the American inventory.

At a tightly controlled ceremony at Edwards Air Force Base in California the B-21 Raider was introduced to the public after years of speculation as to the nature of the latest and most advanced stealth bomber.

To sombre music heavy on percussion the audience of dignitaries watched as hangar doors slowly opened to reveal a dramatically lit interior with the aircraft hidden under a huge shroud. On cue the backlit shroud was pulled away and under the supervision of the ground crew the B-21 was towed forward.

The lighting was kept low so details were almost impossible to make out aside from the general outline showing the B-21 shares the same flying-wing design as the currently serving B-2 bomber.

Described by Northrop Grumman as the world's first sixth-generation aircraft it boasts an open-architecture design advanced integration of data sensors and weapons. Beyond that not much has been publicly revealed though it has been speculated that the engines incorporate lessons learned from those made for the F-35 Lightning II fighter and have a stealth coating that requires less maintenance than that of the B-2. In addition its more advanced design may incorporate new stealth features including new engine intakes and outlets and the use of radar-absorbing ceramics in the engine design that are less susceptible to wear than the polymer versions used in present stealth aircraft.

Named after the Dolittle Raiders of the Second World War the B-21 Raider will join the B-1B B-2 and B-52 aircraft of the Air Force bomber fleet and will eventually replace all of them by 2050. However the US Air Force inventory has been badly neglected since the end of the Cold War and the bomber force has shrunk to the point where only about 15 heavy bombers can be brought into combat at any one time.

With the deteriorating international situation Northrop Grumman is working to speed up production by introducing digital engineering methods and skipping building an experimental prototype in favor of one that is as close as possible to the production variant. Even then the first B-21 is not expected to become fully operational until 2030.

When it does it will have such a long range that it will not require basing overseas or forward logistical support bases. It will also be capable of networking with battle-space assets on land sea air and space and will be capable of quickly incorporating new technologies as they are developed.

""The B-21 Raider is a testament to America’s enduring advantages in ingenuity and innovation"" said Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. ""And it’s proof of the Department’s long-term commitment to building advanced capabilities that will fortify America’s ability to deter aggression today and into the future. Now strengthening and sustaining U.S. deterrence is at the heart of our National Defense Strategy. This bomber was built on a foundation of strong bipartisan support in Congress. And because of that support we will soon fly this aircraft test it and then move into production.""

The United States has unveiled its latest high-tech strategic bomber – the B-21 Raider – which is capable of carrying a nuclear payload and can be flown without a crew on board.

The next-generation stealth bomber was rolled out at arm’s manufacturer Northrop Grumman’s facility in California during a flashy ceremony attended by top US officials on Friday.

The US Air Force plans to buy at least 100 of the B-21 aircraft which comes with a $700m price tag per plane a Northrop Grumman spokesperson said.

The unveiling of the new bombers comes at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions between the US Russia and China amid the war in Ukraine and the territorial integrity of Taiwan.

Russian and Chinese strategic bombers flew a joint eight-hour patrol over the western Pacific on Wednesday in a display of ongoing military cooperation between the two nations.

China’s Defence Ministry called the mission a “routine” effort in bolstering defence ties with Russia.

Moscow and Beijing are also currently developing strategic stealth bombers – China’s Xian H-20 and Russia’s nuclear-capable Tupolev PAK DA – which are expected to compete with the B-21.

While the B-21 is capable of taking to the air without a pilot the US Air Force said the aircraft is “provisioned for the possibility but there has been no decision to fly without a crew”.

“The B-21 Raider is the first strategic bomber in more than three decades” US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a prepared statement at Friday’s event.

Austin touted the aircraft’s range and superior design.

“No other long-range bomber can match its efficiency” Austin said.

“Fifty years of advances in low-observable technology have gone into this aircraft” he said.

“Even the most sophisticated air defence systems will struggle to detect the B-21 in the sky.”

The B-21 which carries a similar “flying wing” shape to its predecessor will be capable of carrying conventional and nuclear weapons around the world using long-range and midair refuelling capabilities.

Northrop Grumman has hailed the new planes as “the backbone of our future bomber force”.

The aerospace and design company said the long-range bomber’s first flight is expected to take place in 2023.

The B-21 was unveiled during a dramatic ceremony at Northrop’s Plant 42 in Palmdale California offering members of the public the first look at the new bomber.

The B-21 which carries a similar “flying wing” shape to its predecessor the B-2 will be able to deliver both conventional and nuclear weapons around the world using long-range and mid-air refueling capabilities.

The aircraft were projected to cost approximately $550 million each in 2010 dollars or about $750 million in today’s inflation-adjusted dollars.

The Air Force planned to buy at least 100 of the planes and begin to replace B-1 and B-2 bombers.

Northrop beat out a team comprised of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp when it won the 2015 contract to make the bomber. Engine-maker Pratt & Whitney Collins Aerospace GKN Aerospace BAE Systems and Spirit Aerosystems are among the more than 400 suppliers in 40 states.

Northrop is calling the plane a sixth generation aircraft given its ability to connect to other aircraft and easily integrate future weapons into its systems architecture.

The B-21 also features more durable stealth-enabling low observable surface material that will require less maintenance and keep operations costs and downtime to a minimum Doug Young sector vice president and general manager at Northrop Grumman Aeronautics Systems told Reuters in an interview.

The presentation provided the first video and photo images of the new bomber. Previously only artist renderings have been published.

Six of the planes which is to have its first flight in mid-2023 are in various stages of assembly. More than 8000 people from Northrop Grumman industry partners and the Air Force currently work on the program.

""Having two GPUs with the same RTX 4080 designation is confusing."" That's right we're talking about the ""unlaunching"" of the 12GB RTX 4080 about two months ago.

For those of you not up to speed when Nvidia announced their latest GeForce 40 series they did so with three products: the flagship RTX 4090 the RTX 4080 16GB and RTX 4080 12GB. The problem was that the two RTX 4080 variants were very different and those differences were not limited to memory capacity as the naming scheme was hinting.

That's because in order to cut down the memory capacity without using lower density chips you also need to reduce the memory bus width. Using different silicon that would result in substantially different performance was not a good move but this sort of dodgy behavior wasn't new. Nvidia had done it before for example with the DDR4 version of the GeForce GT 1030.

The big mistake was announcing the RTX 4080 12GB and that particular anti-consumer move to the world in the biggest event Nvidia had held in years. Traditionally how they like to handle dodgy product releases is to sneak them out at a later date via a silent launch meaning far fewer people notice and even fewer seem to care.

Well this is exactly what they have done with the 8GB variant of the GeForce RTX 3060. Ironically they launched this product on October 27 just 12 days after unlaunching the 12GB 4080 for having a confusing name.

Although it's true that both the 8GB and 12GB variants of the RTX 3060 are based on the GA106 silicon – so it is technically the same GPU – the changes still go well beyond an adjustment to memory capacity. The memory subsystem of the 8GB model has been drastically reduced the L2 cache is 50% larger for the 12GB model as is the bus width. All in all bandwidth is 61% greater in the original RTX 3060 model producing 360 GB/s whereas the ""new"" 8GB variant has been slashed to just 224 GB/s – the same bandwidth as the RTX 3050.

Ultimately this means the 8GB RTX 3060 is going to be slower than the 12GB model – and spoiler alert it's ~15% slower on average – but in some instances we're seeing margins of over 30% so it's a big enough deal for us to bring it to your attention.

One additional note Nvidia hasn't made any official adjustments to MSRPs so the 8GB RTX 3060 still comes in at $330. Looking over at Newegg we can see that the 12GB RTX 3060 starts at $350 with a number of models available for between $350 and $380. Meanwhile the most affordable 8GB variant comes from Inno3D and it starts at $385 though there are some Asus models on backorder at $360 and $370. Point is in terms of pricing there's no distinguishing between the original 12GB models and these new gimped 8GB versions.

In Australia we bought a Galax model that we purchased for a 10% discount from the original 12GB version and you might think ""Well that's okay"" but it's not. The GeForce RTX 3060 was released almost 2 years ago everyone is familiar with how it performs and those that aren't can quickly consult the bevvy of online benchmarks. Meanwhile this new 8GB model is nowhere to be found as there isn't a review program it's up to reviewers to purchase the card and inform consumers.

In fact you might not even know there was an 8GB version or simply assumed the RTX 3060 only came with 8GB of VRAM just as the 3060 Ti does. The trap here is that unsuspecting consumers could be baited into paying RTX 3060 12GB money or very near so for a product that's significantly slower.

We asked Nvidia for an official response about why the 8GB version was released and they simply said it was to offer customers more options. They also stated that the 12GB version was going to remain available in parallel. And just to be clear this is an Nvidia sanctioned product and not their partners going rogue rather it's possible partners are obligated to produce it.

Nvidia appears to be looking to clear out their inventory of lower-end Ampere GPUs and are no doubt keen to maximize profits as they do so. This also allows them to sell defective GA106 silicon for far more than they would get selling it as an RTX 3050.

Our issue is of course that we now have two products called ""GeForce RTX 3060"" and they don't deliver the same level of performance and in many instances it's not even close. And we're not talking about memory bound testing – as in exceeding the 8GB VRAM buffer – we're talking about performance when remaining well within the 8GB buffer.

So let's take a look at that we'll go over a few games and then show you a 12 game average. For collecting these results we used fresh data with both 12GB and 8GB RTX 3060 cards using the latest display drivers. Other GPUs are included for comparison purposes.

Benchmarks

Starting with Cyberpunk 2077 we find that the 12GB model is 13% faster at 1080p when compared to the new 8GB model not a massive difference but it's certainly noteworthy.

That margin grows to 18% at 1440p and now we're looking a two different tiers of performance and a noticeably better gaming experience with the original 12GB model.

Moving on to Dying Light 2 here we have a game that is clearly memory heavy and as such the 8GB model limits the performance of the RTX 3060 GPU.

The original card was a massive 35% faster at 1080p that's a tremendous performance difference for two products sharing the same name and it's the same story at 1440p. In fact here we go from a very console-like 34fps with the 8GB version to a much smoother 46 fps using the original 3060.

Halo Infinite sees the 12GB model offering 21% greater performance at 1080p going from 63 fps to 76 fps another big performance difference for two products that share the same name. The margin remains similar at 1440p where the original 12GB 3060 was 19% faster.

Horizon Zero Dawn sees a smaller 16% performance improvement for the 12GB model over the new 8GB version though that margin did grow to 20% at 1440p.

Both results are bad as a double-digit change in performance is unacceptable especially given the difference in memory capacity plays no role here.

We're also looking at 22% greater performance for the 12GB variant in Shadow of the Tomb Raider as the new 8GB model drops performance to 85 fps. The margin is similar at 1440p where the 12GB version is 20% faster rendering an additional 12 fps.

Performance Summary

That's enough with the individual game results you can easily get the idea. On average you can expect 17% better performance with the 12GB model at 1080p but as we saw that margin can be as high as 35%...

It's a similar story at 1440p when working within the 8GB buffer the 12GB model was still on average 18% faster as it enjoys significantly more memory bandwidth.

What We Learned

The new 8GB version of the GeForce RTX 3060 is noticeably slower than the original and in a number of instances was significantly slower in our testing. In our opinion this is a horrible anti-consumer move by Nvidia it serves little more than to line their pockets while misleading and potentially ripping off customers.

It's true that pricing could be improved at which point it might not be bad in terms of value. After all let's say Nvidia drops the price relative to the 12GB version by 20% or even 30% then the 8GB RTX 3060 would start looking pretty great in terms of value at least compared to Nvidia's own product stack.

We would agree with that assessment had it been called let's say the ""GeForce RTX 3060 LE 8GB"" something that makes it clear to prospective buyers this isn't your typical RTX 3060. In that case we wouldn't really have a problem with this cut-down model and while we'd still prefer a name change entirely we could at least accept a more honest attempt at making it clear to buyers that this is a different version.

To demonstrate just how difficult it is for the uninitiated to even tell which model they're buying or that there is even a different model here's the box for our original RTX 3060 and the new 8GB box...

Those operating under the assumption that an RTX 3060 is an RTX 3060 might see an 8GB model selling for a reasonable discount and think they've stumbled upon a bargain snap it up only to realize their bargain is quite a bit slower than it would have been otherwise. And for those none the wiser it just means you could have done better and possibly gone further between upgrades.

Unfortunately this sort of behavior will continue unless Nvidia faces enough backlash from consumers and the enthusiast community. We're always going to fight against this sort of anti-consumer behavior from corporations whether it be Nvidia AMD Intel LG Samsung MSI Asus and so on many of these companies we've taken to task in the past and we'll continue to do so.

Rest assured if AMD was to pull a similar stunt we'd go after them just as hard much like when we dedicated several articles to call them out over the plans to axe Zen 3 support for 300 and 400 series motherboards. We were having none of their excuses we didn't buy into the technical reasons for why they had to end support. Put simply they misled consumers we went after them and they corrected course and this was made possible thanks to strong push back from the community.

We don't expect to see the same thing happen here with Nvidia but we've done our bit you've now been made aware of what the 8GB RTX 3060 is and you know to avoid it at current asking prices.

While the GeForce RTX 3060 8 GB contains the same GA106 GPU as its 12 GB sibling NVIDIA's memory changes significantly hamper in-game performance.

Hardware Unboxed has outlined the performance of the RTX 3060 8 GB which NVIDIA announced last month with a new RTX 3060 Ti. While the latter received a GDDR6X VRAM upgrade the RTX 3060 8 GB has 4 GB of VRAM less than the original RTX 3060 as well as a narrower 128-bit memory bus. As a result the RTX 3060 8 GB delivers 240 GB/s of memory bandwidth two-thirds of what the original RTX 3060 manages. Unsurprisingly the newer RTX 3060 falls short of its older namesake in benchmarks despite containing the same GA106 GPU.

According to Hardware Unboxed the difference between the two models is stark in certain titles. As the YouTube channel discusses in the video below the RTX 3060 8 GB offers up to 35% worse performance in some modern triple-A titles like Dying Light 2 than the original RTX 3060. However a 17% gap exists between the pair in a dozen games tested at 1080p. A similar gap exists at 1440p too with Hardware Unboxed using these resolutions to prevent VRAM usage from being a bottleneck.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdoYWNrcy5uZXQvMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9udmlkaWEtZ3JhcGhpY3MtZHJpdmVyLTUyNy0zNy1maXhlcy1zb21lLWJ1Z3MtYW5kLXNldmVyYWwtc2VjdXJpdHktaXNzdWVzL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdoYWNrcy5uZXQvMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9udmlkaWEtZ3JhcGhpY3MtZHJpdmVyLTUyNy0zNy1maXhlcy1zb21lLWJ1Z3MtYW5kLXNldmVyYWwtc2VjdXJpdHktaXNzdWVzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA graphics driver update fixes some bugs and patches several security issues,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ghacks.net', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/12/03/nvidia-graphics-driver-527-37-fixes-some-bugs-and-several-security-issues/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C4923D6110>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdoYWNrcy5uZXQvMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9udmlkaWEtZ3JhcGhpY3MtZHJpdmVyLTUyNy0zNy1maXhlcy1zb21lLWJ1Z3MtYW5kLXNldmVyYWwtc2VjdXJpdHktaXNzdWVzL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdoYWNrcy5uZXQvMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9udmlkaWEtZ3JhcGhpY3MtZHJpdmVyLTUyNy0zNy1maXhlcy1zb21lLWJ1Z3MtYW5kLXNldmVyYWwtc2VjdXJpdHktaXNzdWVzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9yZWRkaXRvci1kaXNjb3ZlcnMtbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtZ3R4LXRpdGFuLXgtZ3B1LXdpdGgtdHdvLWRpc3BsYXktY29ubmVjdG9yc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Redditor discovers NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X GPU with two display connectors,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='videocardz.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /newz/redditor-discovers-nvidia-geforce-gtx-titan-x-gpu-with-two-display-connectors (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C4923D4940>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9yZWRkaXRvci1kaXNjb3ZlcnMtbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtZ3R4LXRpdGFuLXgtZ3B1LXdpdGgtdHdvLWRpc3BsYXktY29ubmVjdG9yc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

“What a weekend at the Dome for us in both the Modified and Super Late Model. These Royal Race Cars that Mike Learman is building are something special and I encourage everyone to check them out. This car drove like a dream both nights and we got a pair of wins. I really appreciate Mike and Lauren (Learman) for having me drive it” Thornton Jr. said. “We were really good in the Late Model too. We missed the lock-in spot by one position on Thursday but we got in on Saturday and raced from 13th to third. It was a great weekend and we really appreciate all of the great sponsors and fans for their support. Next up we’ll be competing at the Tulsa Shootout later this month.”

Ricky Thornton Jr. visited the Dome at America’s Center (St. Louis Mo.) on Thursday afternoon to compete in the Super Late Model and Modified ranks in the opening round of the sixth annual Gateway Dirt National presented by O’Reilly Auto Parts.

With the 119-car Super Late Model field split into two groups Thornton followed up the fastest lap in time trials on Thursday with a heat race win. Starting the $5000-to-win preliminary feature in fifth Ricky gained one spot in the 25-lapper to finish fourth.

Aboard the Mike and Lauren Learman-owned No. 20RT Royal Race Cars Modified on Friday Ricky secured his spot into Saturday’s main event with the eighth win of the season in the 20-lap preliminary feature.

After dashing to an eight-lap heat race victory Thornton grabbed the lead on the fifth circuit of the prelim and never looked back taking the checkers 2.060 seconds ahead of Mike McKinney.

On Saturday Thornton edged his way into the $30000-to-win Super Late Model feature with the second-and-final transfer spot in his qualifier. Advancing through the field 10 spots in the 40-lap affair Ricky raced to a third-place finish which came behind Tyler Erb and Tanner English.

Rolling off fourth for the Modified A-Main Ricky wrestled away the lead from Jordan Grabouski on lap 20 and led the final 10 circuits to capture his second win of the weekend and ninth of the 2022 campaign. He pocketed a $10000 prize ahead of Mike McKinney Grabouski Kyle Steffens and Chase Holland.

Next on tap for ‘RTJ’ is a quartet of divisional action at the upcoming 38th annual Lucas Oil Tulsa Shootout at the Sagenet Center (Tulsa. Okla.) on Dec. 26-31. Ricky will be pursuing Golden Driller trophies in the Stock Non-Wing Stock Wing Outlaw Wing and Outlaw Non-Wing divisions.

OXY,Occidental Petroleum,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzAzLzEyLXRvcC1zdG9ja3MtdG8tYnV5LWluLWRlY2VtYmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Top Stocks to Buy in December,"Add this dandy dozen to your stocking this month.

The number 12 is tightly linked with December. It's the 12th month of course. There are 12 days of Christmas according to the traditional carol. Allow me to add one more connection with 12 to the list. Here are 12 top stocks to buy in December (listed alphabetically by category).

Energizers

Let's start off with a group I called the ""energizers."" These are stocks of companies that are in the energy sector and have solid prospects going into the new year.

1. Brookfield Renewable

The shift to renewable energy is arguably one of the most unstoppable trends around. Countries and companies across the world are scrambling to reduce their carbon emissions. That points to a bright future for Brookfield Renewable (BEP 1.34%) (BEPC 2.08%). The company currently operates hydroelectric wind solar and distributed energy facilities with a combined capacity of 24 gigawatts. Brookfield Renewable's development pipeline capacity is more than 4 times greater.

2. Devon Energy

Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%) has been a big winner in 2022 soaring close to 60% year to date. The oil and gas producer should be able to perform well in 2023 as well with Devon likely to generate strong free cash flow. Even if the stock doesn't sizzle in the new year investors can enjoy Devon's juicy dividend yield of 8%.

3. Enterprise Products Partners

Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.59%) stands out as another high-yield dividend stock that's practically a no-brainer pick. The midstream energy company offers a dividend yield of nearly 7.8%. Enterprise has increased its dividend for 24 consecutive years. And its fortunes don't depend on fuel prices. The company charges fees for transporting fuels and chemicals through its pipelines that aren't based on commodity prices at all.

4. Occidental Petroleum

Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.04%) has been an especially big winner this year with its shares skyrocketing 140%. You can thank Warren Buffett for part of this impressive gain. Buffett has loaded up on Occidental stock for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. I think the Buffett effect will continue into 2023. Berkshire secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of Occidental but currently owns only 21.4%.

Healthy picks

Whether or not a recession is on the way remains to be seen. But several healthcare stocks should be able to deliver solid gains no matter what happens.

5. Axsome Therapeutics

Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM -1.60%) stock has nearly doubled this year. Wall Street thinks it can go a lot higher. I agree. Axsome now has a potentially huge winner with major depressive disorder drug Auvelity on the market. It also expects to file for U.S. regulatory approvals in 2023 for AXS-07 in treating migraines and AXS-14 in treating fibromyalgia.

6. Novocure

Novocure (NVCR 2.11%) is another healthcare stock that could soon skyrocket. The company plans to announce results from a late-stage study evaluating its tumor treating fields (TTFields) therapy in treating non-small cell lung cancer in early 2023. Novocure also has data from three other late-stage studies of TTFields on the way over the next couple of years.

7. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

I view Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.91%) as a virtually unstoppable growth stock to buy and hold. The company has a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. It should soon file for regulatory approvals of exa-cel in treating (to be more precise curing) rare blood disorders sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Vertex's pipeline is also loaded with potential blockbuster therapies.

Tech and fintech

Sure tech and fintech stocks have taken a beating in 2022. But the future should be brighter over the long run -- especially for these two stocks.

8. Alphabet

I think Alphabet (GOOG -0.75%) (GOOGL -0.77%) is the best FAANG stock to buy in December. The Google parent's moat remains strong. Its growth prospects look great particularly with Google Cloud. Alphabet could also have some game changers in its ""other bets"" portfolio.

9. Mercadolibre

MercadoLibre (MELI -0.08%) stands out as a company whose stock performance hasn't reflected its underlying business strength in 2022. The Latin American e-commerce and fintech leader delivered 61% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarter. Look for MercadoLibre to rebound strongly once macroeconomic worries subside.

The REIT stuff

Some of the stocks already mentioned could appeal to income investors (namely Devon and Enterprise Products Partners). However there are also a few real estate investment trusts (REITs) that offer fantastic dividends and have solid long-term growth potential.

10. Digital Realty Trust

Digital Realty Trust (DLR -1.45%) is a data center REIT with a dividend yield of nearly 4.5%. CEO Bill Stein noted in the company's third-quarter earnings call that there are ""powerful long-term secular demand trends broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT."" He's right -- and that translates to great opportunities for this REIT going forward.

11. Easterly Government Properties

If you're looking for a super-safe business Easterly Government Properties (DEA) could be just the ticket. The REIT leases properties to U.S. government agencies. The risk of missed rents (one of the biggest threats to REITs) is practically nonexistent for Easterly. Investors should also like Easterly's dividend yield of more than 6.7%.

12. Medical Properties Trust

Last but not least Medical Properties Trust (MPW 1.92%) is a healthcare REIT with a mouth-watering dividend yield of nearly 9.2%. The financial outlook for the hospital operators that lease MPT's properties should improve with higher reimbursements on the way. With its attractive dividend and valuation (shares trade at under seven times expected earnings) MPT looks like a great beaten-down stock to buy in December.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A source close to the football program confirmed to News 3 that Kevin Decker will be hired as the Monarchs' new offensive coordinator. Decker has already changed his Twitter handle to @CoachDeckODU.

Old Dominion Athletics could not offer official comment on Saturday.

Decker just wrapped up his fourth season as the offensive coordinator at Fordham. The Rams were a scoring machine this past campaign averaging 49.5 points per game which was good enough for second among FCS programs. Old Dominion averaged 19.5 points per game in 2022 117th among FBS programs.

Once hired Decker will take over for the fired Kevin Reihner who served as offensive coordinator for this season one that saw ODU finish 3-9 and lose its final six games of the campaign. Two of its top offensive weapons running back Blake Watson and wide receiver Ali Jennings have announced that they will enter the transfer portal.

Ricky Rahne has had a revolving door of offensive coordinators for the last year-plus. He parted ways with Kirk Campbell a day after the 2021 regular season finale against Charlotte. Following that season Rahne hired Dave Patenaude to take over the role but Patenaude resigned shortly after fall camp kicked off this past August. Reihner was given the position shortly before the season began. With his new hire Rahne picks up a coach that has a proven ability to spark offensive production.

Decker helped Fordham to a 9-3 finish in 2022 and a berth in the FCS playoffs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpbG90b25saW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzAzL29kdS1oaXJlcy1mb3JkaGFtLW9mZmVuc2l2ZS1jb29yZGluYXRvci1tYWtlcy1vdGhlci1jaGFuZ2VzLXRvLXN0YWZmLXNvdXJjZXMtc2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ODU hires Fordham offensive coordinator makes other changes to staff sources say,Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window),https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vb2R1c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTIvMDMvbW9uYXJjaHMtc2VjdXJlLTU3LTMxLXdpbi1hdC11c2MtdXBzdGF0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Monarchs Secure 57-31 Win at USC Upstate,"SPARTANBURG S.C. – Old Dominion women's basketball earned its third win in a row with a 57-31 wire-to-wire victory at USC Upstate on Saturday afternoon at the G.B. Hodge Center.



""We wanted to see how many stops we could get consecutively and I think we did a great job of keeping them scoreless for a large amount of time"" said head coach DeLisha Milton-Jones. ""But then as the game went on we were held scoreless for too long and that's something that's concerning for me. You always want to respect whoever it is that you're playing and I think tonight we had too many lulls between our play. We still have a new group and we're still learning new things with every game.""



Amari Young turned in a 12-point 10-rebound double-double and Jordan McLaughlin led both teams with 16 points. Young also grabbed seven steals and recorded two blocks with one assist. Kaye Clark contributed eight points with six rebounds six steals and five assists.



The Monarchs (5-3) shot 24-for-57 (.421) from the field 3-for-15 (.200) from beyond the arc and 6-for-13 (.462) at the free-throw line. ODU won every quarter and scored more points off turnovers (21-10) more points in the paint (38-6) more second-chance points (9-3) and more fast-break points (13-5).



ODU opened the game on an 8-0 run before the Spartans (1-6) finally got on the board with a pair of free throws at the 1:43 mark. Jatyjia Jones then assisted Brenda Fontana on a layup before Upstate's Rebekah Gordon closed out the first quarter with a three-pointer from the left wing.



In the second quarter the hosts put together a 5-0 run to close the gap at 13-11 with 5:14 on the clock. McLaughlin then made the hoop and harm and Young scored a layup to push the Monarch lead to 18-11 with 1:48 left in the first half. Following another two points from Gordan Makayla Dickens found Clark in the left corner and the Milwaukee Wisconsin native made her shot from distance. Clark then stole the ball and scored a driving layup as the Monarchs led 23-13 at halftime.



""We had a decent start but I think we could have come out even stronger"" said Young. ""Going in with a defensive mindset we knew that we could play in the gaps get in the passing lanes and get some steals. That was one of our main focuses coming in.""



It was another fast start to the third quarter as ODU scored another 14 straight points to pull away 37-13. Upstate then outscored the Monarchs 15-2 over the final four minutes and 50 seconds to cut the ODU lead to 39-28 heading into the final 10 minutes.



McLaughlin made a pair of buckets to get things started in the fourth quarter. Clark then set up Young for a layup underneath and Brianna Jackson got a pair of layups to fall to cap off the 10-0 run. After Isabella Geraci went 1-for-2 at the charity stripe at the 3:20 mark Jones followed a Mikayla Brown layup with a three ball from the left wing. That rounded out the scoring as the Spartans turned over the ball and ODU dribbled out the rest of the clock.



The Monarchs open a three-game homestand this Tuesday Dec. 6 as ODU welcomes Lincoln (Pa.) for an 11 a.m. contest at Chartway Arena. The first meeting between the two programs it marks ODU's Education Day game.



Game Notes

- Saturday's game marked the third meeting in the all-time series. ODU is now 3-0 when playing the Spartans.

A recent study by Magnite (Nasdaq: MGNI) the independent omnichannel sell-side advertising platform stated that ads on streaming platforms capture more attention than ads on social media in India.The study entitled “India Embraces the Streaming Era” that found that nearly two thirds of India’s streamers (64 per cent) are more responsive to advertising on streaming platforms with many stating they often search for the product (48 per cent) and make a purchase (33 per cent) after the fact.Magnite engaged Dynata to execute an online survey to a nationally representative sample of 2500 television watchers in India.Qualifying respondents of this report were aged between 16 to 74 and were a natural fall out of those watching more than seven hours of TV a week with at least five hours a week of streaming video content from a nationally representative starting sample.The study also found that free or ad-supported content is preferred to paying for an ad-free experience. 80 per cent of streamers prefer to watch ad-supported content versus subscribing to an ad-free platform for a monthly fee the report stated.“OTT is unmatched in its ability to engage viewers and we commissioned this study to better understand consumption patterns across the rapidly growing India streaming audience” said Gavin Buxton managing director Asia at Magnite.“One of the study’s key findings shows that OTT advertising outperforms other mediums like social media when it comes to attention and purchasing power. With three quarters of video viewers streaming more now than a year ago advertisers should be actively exploring this channel to reach the right audiences” Buxton added. Live streaming is becoming mainstream. Nearly all streamers (86 per cent) said they watch live content through streaming platforms with streaming particularly prevalent across news sport and reality content the report revealed.Streamers are more likely to watch live programming on streaming platforms than on traditional TV the study mentioned.The study also found that two thirds of streamers prefer to watch streaming services over traditional TV and streamers rank the quality of content platform usability and content discovery as the top factors driving their decision to stream.According to the report the majority (75 per cent) of streamers are streaming more video content than a year ago and 66 per cent expect to stream more next year.“We are witnessing the next stage in streaming’s evolution – one where the lines between SVOD and AVOD and FAST are being blurred as we see audiences continue to fragment” said Prabhvir Sahmey senior director at Samsung Ads  India.Mobile commands the majority of streamers’ time and 88 per cent of viewers reported a positive viewing experience on smartphones comparable to the number that reported a positive viewing experience on TV screens the report stated.Sahmey further added “Whilst globally we’re seeing the major streaming giants introduce ad-funded and hybrid models locally we’ve seen the adoption of these freemium models in India gain considerable viewership.”Mobile is the top streaming device but time spent streaming on CTV is growing as smart TVs are introduced into Indian homes the report revealed.As per the report 59 per cent of streamers are now watching CTV and spending an average of eight hours per week streaming content on a big screen.“The migration of audiences from linear TV to streaming signals an opportunity for our clients who are looking to invest in CTV and incorporate TV buys into their overall advertising strategies with screen-agnostic planning” said Bharat Khatri chief digital officer APAC at Omnicom Media Group “Advertisers should take note of where viewership is moving and invest in OTT to reach highly engaged viewers watching their favorite shows. At the same time we are seeing a big shift happening on the measurement front with viewability amounting to three seconds or half of an ad flashed on rapidly scrolling screens. It’s easy to see a growing gap between the opportunity to be seen and actually being seen thus the need of the hour is to start optimising based on attention to generate incremental value across creative media planning and buying and in turn improve brand health and performance” Khatri added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This marks a major milestone in Europe’s efforts to catch up with other regions in the production of semiconductors and improve its resilience to supply chain disruptions.

On February 8 2022 the European Commission submitted to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal for a regulation establishing a framework of measures to strengthen Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem. The European Chips Act is set to mobilize €43 billion in public and private funding for the semiconductor industry with the ambition to double the EU’s current share of global chip production to 20% in 2030.

In a statement semiconductor industry association SEMI celebrated the progress on the European Chips Act by the European Council and reiterated its support for an early start to negotiations in 2023.

“The future for Europe as a region of semiconductor manufacturing excellence is brimming with possibility” commented Laith Altimime president of SEMI Europe. “The adoption of the European Council’s general approach marks a critical step in passage of the European Chips Act as a landmark initiative for our industry.”

Amended propositions

On Nov. 25 the Council presented its “Regulation establishing a framework of measures for strengthening Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem (Chips Act) – General approach”. The Council indeed amended several provisions of the Commission’s proposal to take into account the requests of delegations during the discussions at working group level to improve the clarity and feasibility of the proposal and to ensure legal certainty.

As listed in the 105-page document the Council’s proposed changes concerned the following 10 issues:

the definition of “first-of-a-kind” semiconductor manufacturing facility to clarify that the qualifying element could be innovation in many different dimensions;

the formulation of the general and operational objectives and the content of the Chips for Europe Initiative as well as the specification of research and innovation activities and of capacity building activities;

the harmonizing component of the Chips Act and the objective of improving the functioning of the internal market;

the establishment of a European network of competence centers in semiconductors integration technologies and system design;

the requirements to be met by Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries notably as regards positive spill-over effects on the Union’s semiconductor value chain;

the role of Member States through the European Semiconductor Board in the decision on the status of Integrated Production Facility or Open EU Foundry including in the case of a repeal;

the possibility to derogate from environmental procedures in the planning construction and operation of Integrated Production Facilities or Open EU Foundries considered to be of “overriding public interest”;

the design of mandatory information requests during a crisis stage to be carried out by the Commission including safeguards to ensure their proportionality and security interests;

the scope and implementation of the emergency toolbox as regards the list of critical sectors and the instruments of priority rated orders and common purchasing and the provision of a Council implementing act to trigger a crisis stage;

the enforcement of information and notification obligations and of the compliance with priority rated orders through fines and penalties.

European Chips Infrastructure Consortium

The Chips Act regulation suggested a new legal entity the European Chips Infrastructure Consortium (ECIC) to structure legal relationships between private and public members and to act as an interface for the implementation of actions.

The Council has proposed further clarification on the voluntary nature of establishing an ECIC on its openness to different legal forms of cooperation and other participants and on its rules for the selection of proposals for funding that should not be based on a specific legal form of cooperation.

What’s next?

Now that the Council has adopted its position the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry Research and Energy (ITRE) is expected to vote on the European Union Chips Act Report in January 2023.

Once approved the Committee will submit the text to plenary for adoption. The vote in plenary is scheduled in February 2023. The text would constitute the European Parliament’s negotiating position and marks the last step before the start of trialogue negotiations among the European Commission Parliament and Council SEMI said.

I say a handful. One seemed like it would be enough: one car one engine one big fat semiconductor. My estimate was a little short. Some cars come loaded with as many as 3000.

More from Robb Report

Semiconductors—aka microchips—are big business as you probably know. According to an organization called World Semiconductor Trade Statistics more than 932 billion of them were made in 2020 a number so vast I don’t even know what to compare it to.

Instead some math. Of those many billions half are absorbed by electronics while another 15 percent go into the automotive industry equating to about 140 billion chips. The world turned out 78 million new cars in 2020 which would give an average of around 1800 chips per new car. By any measure that’s a very big handful.

But even at those numbers there still aren’t enough to go round. Demand for new cars is still higher than the supply of microchips can keep up with sending delivery times into a spin. In September a friend of mine took delivery of a car he’d specced in January. By the time it finally arrived he’d forgotten what color he’d chosen.

He was lucky. If he’d ordered a Land Rover Defender he might have waited 12 months. For a Porsche Taycan longer still. If he’d gone for a Tesla Model X Dual Motor he could have been kept hanging for up to two years.

If that’s dispiriting the advice on beating the wait is worse. Compromise on trim tends to be the consensus which is tantamount to saying you should buy something you don’t really like. And that’s no advice at all.

Even more depressing car manufacturers seem to think that because this is now normal we must be okay with it. The Polestar 3 an all-electric cheaper rival to the Porsche Cayenne was announced in October. It looks very good.

But no one will know how good until. . .well Polestar has said first deliveries won’t start until Q4 2023 and its US production site might not yield any cars until 2024.

Will we wait? Probably. Marques are well aware of the general public’s obsession with new and shiny things and the particular school of thought that newer and shinier (and bigger and more expensive) always means better seems unlikely to lose momentum anytime soon.

But if the conversation I find myself having increasingly often is anything to go by there’s an alternative school gaining traction alongside it. And it’s this: These new vehicles we’re sitting around waiting for aren’t much fun. They’re very well made but because they’re stuffed full of chips they’re also enormously clever thinking harder faster and far more cautiously than we ever could. But in doing so they’re slowly making us passengers in our own cars.

Early in the fall I tested BMW’s new i4 a fully electric gran coupe. It’s a fantastic machine in myriad ways engineered just about to perfection. But more than once it scared the life out of me braking unexpectedly with bone-shuddering urgency apparently convinced I was about to run over a cat that wasn’t there.

2022 BMW i4 sedan

The effect was that I didn’t feel entirely in control. And that isn’t nice to feel—or to admit.

This isn’t a BMW thing. The feeling is everywhere. I’ve driven Aston Martin’s ferocious DBX707 Porsche’s belligerent Cayman GT4 and Bentley’s sublime Continental GT V8 during the past few months. All fabulous. But in each one I had the uncanny sense that I wasn’t fully the master of my own destiny. Something was always interfering: thousands of those ruddy chips.

I was talking to a friend who owns a car magazine about these drives recently and he looked at me blankly. “I haven’t driven anything new for years” he said a little too dismissively reminding me that the most recent vehicle he’d turned a camera on was the 1971 Maserati Ghibli.

Similarly another pal who runs a production company making fly-on-the-wall documentaries told me the last set of wheels he enjoyed driving was the Mercedes SL he’d had when he was first married 20 years ago.

Now he’s looking for a new car and I’m trying to persuade him to buy a Porsche 911 from the 997 generation built between 2004 and 2013. If I were him I’d start researching the GT3 iteration introduced in 2006. Once described as “the best handling car in America” by Motortrend it could do zero to 60 mph in around four seconds and stopped short of 200 mph by a whisker. And the best bit? A manual gearbox one operated exclusively by a human being.

But he’d be wise not to kick too many tires. Porsche pushed out 213000 units of the 997 but low-mileage examples in pristine condition don’t grow on trees. And prices are going up. According to Classic.com’s tracker in March 2021 average sales prices of the GT3 were hovering around $87000. By the end of October this year that figure had risen to $114000.

The upward trend continues. Ferrari’s F430 Spider another manual from the late 2000s has seen prices spike too up from $194000 last March to $270000 by May this year (when the tracker stops). At the lower end of the collector market BMW’s M3 the E46 of the mid-2000s and an aficionado favorite is also on the rise with average prices up from around $25000 to $30000 over the past 18 months.

Why the pattern? A yearning among a new generation of middle-aged car buyers for the cars that were out of reach when they were just starting out? Sure why not. But that’s overly simplistic. Far more pertinent is that these models are from the last era of true driver’s cars—that if the mood really struck you could be driven into a wall without a microchip chipping in. From a time when the driver’s brain counted for more than the car’s. And the thing about the driver’s brain? It’s so good they need only one.

If you want to see more richest people in the world who own publicly traded companies go directly to 5 Richest People in the World Who Own Publicly Traded Companies.

Family owned businesses are businesses are where the the founder or the family of the founder owns a substantial share of the company and can influence important decisions especially as it relates to the company's Chairman and CEO positions.

In some ways family owned businesses have their advantages. Because they have substantial influence family owned businesses can often make important decisions faster than a non-family CEO given there is less resistance. Family owned businesses can also plan more for the long term rather than focusing on short term metrics if the owner chooses to do so.

By definition many tech startups are family owned given that their founders own a substantial share of the company and exercise a lot of influence. With the growth in the tech industry over the past few decades some family owned companies have grown substantially and many of the founders rank among the world's richest people. Perhaps the best example of this would be billionaire Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) who founded the company before handing off control to current CEO Andy Jassy. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) did not make much profits for many years to gain more market share under Bezos.

Some of the leading companies in emerging markets are also family owned. In India billionaire Gautam Adani runs Adani Group while billionaire Mukesh Ambani continues to steer the giant company that is Reliance Industries.

It should be said that being able to make decisions faster and focusing more on the long term can send stocks lower too. Because billionaire Mark Zuckerberg has the majority voting control of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) he has been able to invest tens of billions into the metaverse which the market has not liked in the near term and is one reason why the stock is lower.

In terms of the world's richest people 2022 has been a challenging year as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times so far. With higher rates the broader market has declined. Nevertheless the richest people in the world who own publicly traded companies still rank among the world's wealthiest.

It is not an easy time to be in tech but there’s no reason why that should deter founders from following through on their optimistic vision for the future.

“You can't be an entrepreneur and be too nervous about the future you have to have a very healthy level of nervousness otherwise we wouldn't be doing what we do” said Liat Hayun co-founder and CEO of Eureka. The company officially came out of stealth earlier this year after securing an $8 million Seed round for its cloud data security posture management platform. Founded alongside Asaf Weiss after the two met at the IDF and both worked at Palo Alto Networks the company helps enterprises find and address their cyber risk regardless of where data is residing in storage clouds.

Hayun and Weiss are building their company in a climate that is leaving many investors anxious about where the next year will go. VCs and founders alike have cited how early-stage companies tend to be a bit more nimble than large growth companies which are forced to conduct ‘restructuring’ often leading to mass layoffs. With 20 employees already based in Israel and the U.S. the company’s next step is strategizing how to steer its smaller ship in the seas of uncertainty.

“We are trying to figure out how that will impact us but so far we haven't felt anything” she said even claiming that companies today are experiencing the same climate Eureka had one year ago. “We are still at a very early stage for it to have any impact on us as opposed to growth stage companies.”

Hayun attributes two main reasons why this is the case. “First it is much easier to slow down or take things a lot more slowly if it’s 20-30 people and you're not already a huge ship where every change requires a huge effort. The other thing is that valuations are largely impacted by the public market and that trickles down but every step you take back the impact is smaller.”

For Eureka and other companies at the early stage the degree to which they need to steady the tide remains a theoretical one. For now the company has money in the bank that can help it grow its R&D offices in Israel and the U.S. while focusing on obtaining customers. While she can’t name them Hayun confirmed that the Eureka platform is already deployed in “dozens of organizations” compiling of both large retailers that existed before the cloud revolution and who are making the shift online as well as young companies that saw explosive growth but now required to secure and protect their data and abide by governance and compliance laws.

“We are seeing both across industries and verticals the problem of maintaining sensitive data. The size of organizations can vary and the different verticals like finance healthcare insurance legal all have sensitive data about all of us and so all of them need help protecting it.”

All tech is equal and yet some tech is more equal than others.

Jay-Z joins Times Square team bidding for prized NYC casino,"SL Green and Caesars Entertainment have a glam new partner in their hoped-for Times Square casino — Brooklyn-born billionaire rapper and entertainment impresario Jay-Z and his Roc Nation Realty Check has learned.

The three-way partnership to be announced at SL Green’s annual investor conference on Monday marks a dramatic twist in the developer’s and Caesars’ quest to launch a casino at SL Green’s 1515 Broadway office tower. (They’re among a half-dozen teams that are also expected to submit proposals to the state for a first full-scale casino in the Big Apple.)

Although details have yet to be spelled out Jay-Z and his team are expected to oversee entertainment programming at 1515 Broadway and at other SL Green properties at the “Crossroads of the World.” The city’s largest commercial landlord SLG has interests in six Times Square properties with a total of more than four million square feet.

In a statement Jay-Z said “New York is the epicenter of culture. We have the opportunity to create a destination at the heart of the true crossroads of the word. My partnership with SL Green and Caesars has all the promise and commitment to economic opportunity growth and enrichment for the community and everyone that visits the Empire State.”

SLG chief executive officer Marc Holliday also shared more specifics about his company’s casino proposal than have ever been disclosed.

Contrary to claims that Caesars Palace Times Square as it’s to be called would be a mammoth gaming mecca that might overwhelm everything around it the casino would occupy only eight floors in the 54-story tower between West 43d and 44th streets.

None would be the ground floor which is earmarked for non-gaming uses including an entrance to the Minskoff Theater home of “The Lion King.”

“We are putting theater at ground level” Holliday emphasized.

The casino floors would also house restaurants and entertainment uses. Holliday estimated that the “boutique”-size casino might occupy as little as 250000 square feet of floor space a postage stamp compared with typical sprawling gaming floors in Atlantic City or Las Vegas.

A new approximately 800-room five-star hotel would be created in the building above them. Holliday said he was “not yet prepared” to address how the tower’s office tenants including Paramount Global’s headquarters would be affected.

He rebutted claims by the Broadway League which represents theater owners and producers that a casino would be “dangerous” to Broadway theaters. On the contrary he said SL Green’s proposal is designed to bolster all the businesses around it. Although the League is adamantly opposed to having a casino in its midst the plan is enthusiastically backed by owners of restaurants such as Carmine’s Bond 45 and Junior’s and by Actors Equity and hotel and construction unions.

According to Holliday consulting firm AKRF projects that casino visitors will buy 400000 net new Broadway tickets annually. Additionally SLG/Caesars/Roc Nation will purchase thousands of tickets directly that will be provided both to casino patrons and to underserved communities.

The casino company’s loyalty program known as Caesars Rewards which boasts 60 million members worldwide provides so-called bankable rewards that can be used at hotels restaurants theaters and stores beyond 1515 Broadway.

As part of a “halo effect” Holliday expects the casino will generate seven million more annual visitors to Times Square generate seven million restaurant meals outside the casino and $166 million in retail purchases outside the casino building.

In SL Green’s view the 1515 Broadway project is needed to help arrest a slow gradual decline in the district’s fortunes.

The slide Holliday said doesn’t yet mark a return to the lawless days of the 1970s-early 1990s — although crime is noticeably up — but rather a slow-but-steady unraveling of the commercial energy and sense of security that Times Square had only 10 years ago.

Some major companies such as Skadden and EY have moved away. Times Square-district office vacancy has soared from 5% in 2012 to nearly 25% today according to CBRE.

Since Toys ‘R’ Us left in 2015 more national retailers — possibly including Forever 21 and American Eagle Outfitters — are also looking to exit citing a decline in the quality of the street environment. Meanwhile more taco doughnut and other types of fast-food joints are moving in.

The state will issue a formal request for proposal (RFP) for casino applicants next month. The selection panel will then move some responses to a state siting committee which is expected to choose one location in the five boroughs before the end of the year.

In addition to SLG/Caesars/Roc Nation wannabe operators are expected to include Related Companies and Wynn Resorts at Hudson Yards Mets owner Steve Cohen and a casino partner near Citi Field in Queens and Soloviev Building Company and a casino partner for a complex called Freedom Plaza on First Avenue in the East 30s.

At least one company is moving to Times Square: accounting advisory firm Anchin Block & Anchin signed a lease for 45673 at Rudin’s Three Times Square which is undergoing a major $25 million upgrade program.

Anchin will move from 1375 Broadway in fall of 2023.

Landlord executive vice-president Michael Rudin said that Anchin was “exactly the sort of firm we had in mind” when his company set out to reposition the tower where Touro College and University System signed for 243000 square feet earlier this year. About 450000 square feet remain available.

On the face of it beneath an encouraging headline there’s some crushingly bad news for those of us working on rigorous evidence-heavy research in a recent study that investigates which information changes the minds of people on the role of international aid spending the efficacy of which many are sceptical about.

The latter point in part explains why many countries are theoretically signed up to spending 0.7% of GDP on aid but most are doing no such thing. The chancellor’s autumn statement confirmed there was no imminent prospect of the UK returning to doing so.

The researchers conducted an experiment to evaluate the impact of telling people (specifically 6000 Germans) that an aid programme worked by measuring its effect on their belief in aid effectiveness. The good news is that this was positive raising average support by more than 10%. But crucially they also examined whether that impact is greater if it is backed up by different kinds of evidence: a serious chart illustrating the results of a scientific evaluation of the programme or a simple anecdote of someone who benefited endorsing the programme. Which kind of evidence had the biggest effect in boosting public support? The words no social scientist wants to read are: “anecdotal evidence performs best”.

But all is not lost. After all while some politicians may only worry about what convinces the public that they are right researchers are also interested in what the truth is in the first place. And there evidence trumps anecdote every time.",,,,,,

The Internal Revenue Service issued a reminder this week for taxpayers to prepare to report transactions of at least $600 that are received through payment apps like Venmo  PayPal and Cash App.

In an explainer posted online the IRS warned small business owners about the $600 threshold for receiving Form 1099-K for third-party payments exceeding $600.

Beginning this year third-party payment processors will be required to report a user's business transactions to the IRS if they exceed $600 for the year. The payment apps were previously required to send users Form 1099-K if their gross income exceeded $20000 or they had 200 separate transactions within a calendar year.

Democrats made the change in March 2021 when they passed the American Rescue Plan without any Republican votes. Now a single transaction over $600 will trigger the form. The change is intended to crack down on Americans evading taxes by not reporting the full extent of their gross income. However critics say that it amounts to government overreach at its worst and that it could ultimately hurt small businesses.

DEMOCRATS SLAM 'DANGEROUS' FED RATE HIKES WARNING OF WIDESPREAD JOB LOSSES

The new rule only applies to payments received for goods and services transactions meaning that using Venmo or PayPal to send a loved one a gift pay your roommate rent or reimburse a friend for dinner will be excluded. Also excluded is anyone who receives money from selling a personal item at a loss; for example if you purchased a couch for $300 and sold it for $250 the amount is not taxable.

""This doesn't include things like paying your family or friends back using PayPal or Venmo for dinner gifts shared trips"" PayPal previously said.

To be clear business owners are already required to report that income to the IRS. The new rule simply means that the IRS will figure out what business owners earned on the cash apps regardless of what that individual actually reports on their 1099-K because it broadens the scope of the threshold.

Form 1099-K is used to report goods and services payments received by a business or individual in the calendar year but there are certain exclusions from gross income that are therefore not subject to income tax including amounts from selling personal items at a loss amounts sent as reimbursements and amounts sent as gifts.

""For the 2022 tax year you should consider the amounts shown on your Form 1099-K when calculating gross receipts for your income tax return"" PayPal said in a Q&A on its website. ""The IRS will be able to cross-reference both our report and yours.""

The cash apps will now be required to send users who meet the newest requirements Form 1099-K for transactions made electronically or by mail.

The apps may request additional information from users in the near future in order to properly report transactions and users may be asked to provide their Employer Identification Number (EIN) Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) or Social Security Number (SSN) if it's not already on file.

It has resulted in banking insiders becoming increasingly worried about fraudsters cashing in on the absence of effective customer protection on the site.

Marketplace — the social media giant's buying and selling platform — has soared in popularity as the cost of living crisis drives families to look for bargains. On the site Marketplace sellers list goods and arrange a sale with potential buyers through Facebook''s built-in messaging platform Messenger reports The Chronicle

Although Marketplace established itself in the online buying and selling business as it allowed people to see goods for sale in their local area items are increasingly being sold over wider distances. In these cases items tend to be posted out similar to other marketplaces such as eBay or Amazon rather than the buyer-collects method.

Local buyers would tend to hand over cash on the doorstep upon seeing and collecting the item Facebook does not offer a built-in payment service like eBay does with PayPal or Amazon does with its credit and debit card payment facility meaning that Facebook shoppers living further afield often use bank transfers to send money directly. This leaves them without the protections offered by PayPal or credit and debit cards where payments can be cancelled or reversed if goods and services are not delivered as advertised according to the financial website Thisismoney.

To date Action Fraud has received 44674 reports citing Facebook or its Marketplace. Worryingly experts think this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg as scams are often under-reported. TSB says three in five reports of social media purchase scams it receives can be traced to Facebook — with an average loss of £380 — and the majority of purchase scams come from Marketplace.

Bank fraud specialists have issued a list of five scam methods on Facebook's Marketplace:

1. Bank transfer con

Buyers can only pay for goods on Facebook Marketplace by cash or bank transfer as there is no option to pay by card which means buyers can be left without any protection if a seller fails to send an item. This is important because if a transaction made with a credit or debit card turns out to be a scam people can get their money back through the chargeback scheme. Paying by bank transfer means buyers are at the mercy of their banks in terms of getting a refund — and different banks have different policies.

Paul Davis director of fraud prevention at TSB recommends only buying from someone in your local area if possible so you are able to see the item before buying it. ""It's a very risky place to shop"" he said. ""It's a bit of a lottery as to whether the person you are dealing with is trustworthy or the item exists or is as described. You're on your own and are taking a gamble. It looks like eBay or Amazon but it hasn't got the same protections around it. It's no different from someone pinning up an advert on a noticeboard.""

2. Paypal friends and family scam

While scammers tend to try to get people to pay via bank transfer they do sometimes suggest PayPal. This might make things seem more legitimate but fraudsters will ask the buyer to use the ""friends and family"" option. This option is designed to be used to send money to someone you know and means the recipient does not have to pay a fee. The scammer might try to sweeten the deal by offering to knock the usual PayPal fee off the price you are charged.

However the ""friends and family"" option leaves you without buyer protection. If something goes wrong it is hard to get your money back. Often once the scammer has taken your money they will block you meaning you have no information about your interactions if you try to report them.

PayPal does offer a Buyer Protection guarantee under which it will refund you if the item is not as described or if it never arrives but you must select the ""goods and services"" payment method to get this. Mr Davis advises buyers to always go through ""goods and services"" if you're buying from someone you don't know. He says: ""If a seller tries to convince you to do something other than paying in the normal way then something odd is happening and you should be on your guard.""

3. Fake ads

Sellers on Amazon and eBay have to pay a fee to be able to use the platform but all you need to start selling on Marketplace is a Facebook account. Bank fraud experts say this has opened the door to scammers who set up fake profiles and use photos stolen from real listings to advertise fake deals.

If they manage to set up a number of fake profiles crooks can advertise the same items with different profiles and can scam many people with the same post because when an item is listed the Messenger chat used to buy the item is private so you can't see what's going on behind the scenes. It is the seller's responsibility to mark an item as sold so they could keep accepting payments privately for an item that they've already sold or which never existed in the first place and you as a buyer would be none the wiser until it's too late.

Check when the account was set up and if it's a very new account and there is little activity on their page be on your guard.

4. The bargain that doesn't exist

Fraud expert Jack Buster of ActionScam urges shoppers to be extra vigilant if they are thinking of buying a motorhome or campervan via Marketplace as these are big business for criminal gangs. ""These fraudsters have a massive database of vehicles with pictures and words and they just recycle them. If enough people read it a few are going to fall for it"" he warns.

He says the biggest warning signal when dealing with vehicle scams is the price. ""As a general rule of thumb scammers slash the price by half or even to about 25 per cent of its value"" he says. ""The value of motorhomes has rocketed over the past couple of years. Vehicles that were £12000 are now £25000. The price of a fake motorhome now looks similar to the price of what a real one used to be two or three years ago so even if it looks really expensive it could still be a scam.""

5. Hoax links from 'buyers'

Even if you're selling and not buying you can still be targeted by fraudsters who regularly send hoax phishing links to sellers using the platform's messaging service — usually asking them to pay for shipping. Posing as potential buyers they will tell the seller that they want to buy the item but they are not based in the UK. They will suggest using a courier service to pick the item up sending a link to a courier site to be used to pay for the shipping cost. The link will send money to the scammer directly who will then disappear before paying you.

Meta which owns Facebook says it works closely with law enforcement to support investigations and keep scammers off its platforms. It is also a part of Stop Scams UK a cross-industry initiative targeting scams at source. It claims the company spent around £4billion on safety and security last year.

The food and beverage giant has reserved one hundred trucks and experts to deploy an initial 15 by the end of the year. PepsiCo said in a statement that “the company has been aiming to reduce fuel costs and emissions” since the initial announcement of the trucks back in 2017.

Even though electric passenger cars receive the most attention the decision to electrify trucking could have a significant impact on an industry known for its high emissions and high fuel prices. Therefore in addition to improving operations adding driver-aid capabilities could save on labor costs.

The Semi will be Tesla’s fifth vehicle joining the S X 3 and Y passenger variants. Moreover the debut carries on Musk’s long-standing promise to enter the heavy-duty vehicle market. The truck’s design is based around the driver with central seating positions and plenty of room for standing and storage.

Whereas Musk mentioned that the Semi has an estimated range of 500 miles on a single charge and its own Tesla charger but he hasn’t revealed anything about production or cost. Musk also mentions the Semi will result in a significant decrease in cargo transportation costs while boosting safety measures.

Musk is tentatively planning on producing 50000 Semis for North America in 2024. Putting to work freight between the company’s factories in Nevada and Fremont and back again so that engineers can continuously refine the product.

The all-electric tractor debuted as a concept in 2017 with an eye on entering production in 2019 but its development and later the coronavirus pandemic caused the date to be pushed off.

The truck arrives with many of the specifications originally promised however including a range of 500 miles per charge fully loaded.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk boasted at the event that it is more powerful than a diesel and that it can accelerate to 60 mph in 5 seconds unladen and in 20 seconds with a full load but did not reveal its exact specifications.

TESLA ‘HIGHLAND’ ELECTRIC CAR IN THE WORKS

The truck uses several off-the-shelf Tesla parts to reduce costs including a three-motor powertrain derived from the one in the Tesla Model S Plaid. It can cruise along using just one of the motors and engage the other two for added torque when necessary.

Tesla showed a video of a truck operating at its maximum combined weight of 82000 pounds accelerating up a 6% grade at highway speeds and a time-lapse of one that weighed 81000 pounds completing a 500-mile trip from Tesla's factory in Fremont California to San Diego on a single charge. Electric Semis are allowed to operate at a maximum of 82000 pounds rather than the traditional maximum of 80000 pounds to accommodate the added weight of their batteries.

Tesla has not released the size of the battery pack required to do this but Elon Musk said after the event on Twitter that the truck operates at an efficiency of 1.7 kilowatt-hours per mile which would suggest the pack has a capacity of approximately 900 kilowatt-hours or more given that it had some charge left at the end of the trip.

For comparison a Tesla Model S Plaid's battery has a capacity of 100 kilowatt-hours. The weight of the battery and the Semi itself were not disclosed so its cargo carrying capacity compared to a diesel semi remains unknown to the public. Competing electric tractors from Freightliner Volvo and Nikola all have shorter ranges but smaller batteries.

That is also the case with the price which was previously advertised at $180000 for a 500-mile truck but removed from Tesla's website. It does however say that an operator could save over $200000 in fuel costs over three years based on diesel and electricity prices in California but without providing any further details.

TESLA DOMINATES ‘MOST AMERICAN-MADE’ VEHICLES LIST

Musk said the truck is built using a new 1000-volt architecture that will allow it to use a megawatt charger that is about three-times more powerful than current systems and can recharge the battery to 70% in a half-hour. He also said that the upcoming Cybertruck pickup would be compatible with the system.

No mention was made at the event of Tesla's Autopilot or Full Self-Driving systems but it is equipped with a stability control system programmed to help prevent jackknifing.

PepsiCo reserved 100 Semis after its 2017 reveal and two with the company's livery were at the event. A spokesperson later told Fox News Digital it expects to receive 36 trucks total by the end of December.

Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm said last month that the company could build 100 by the end of 2022 while Elon Musk said during the company's third-quarter earnings call that it is aiming for a production rate of 50000 annually by 2024.

The automaker revealed the news at a launch event on Friday while sharing some impressive details on the electric big rig’s range and performance.

Tesla first flagged an all-electric heavy-duty truck in CEO Elon Musk’s Master Plan Part Deux back in 2016 with the aim of improving the costs and safety associated with cargo transport and of course its environmental footprint. The Tesla Semi was revealed a year later with pre-orders from the likes of Budweiser following and deliveries planned for 2019.

Tesla has delivered the first production models of its Semi truck to PepsiCo Tesla

The pandemic and other factors combined to delay these deliveries for three years but the Semi has since been put through “hardcore” testing in a range of conditions according to Musk at the launch event on Friday. The vehicle’s powertrain shares the same tri-motor configuration and carbon-sleeve rotors as the ridiculous Model S Plaid which Tesla says affords it three times the power of any diesel truck on the road.

One of those motors is constantly engaged while two of those motors for torque and acceleration can actually disconnect so that they’re not spinning unnecessarily Musk explained improving the efficiency of the truck along the highway. It even does so while pulling 82000 lb (37 metric tons) and has an ability to tackle everyday inclines with speed with regenerative braking capturing kinetic energy on the way down.

This powertrain was put through its paces on a November 25 test drive in which a fully-loaded Tesla Semi straight off the production line weighing 81000 lb (36.7 tons) traveled 500 miles (804 km) on a single charge.

“This wasn’t some ultra-clean precise test track simulation or something where we shut down a road” said Tesla engineering chief Dan Priestley. “Nope this is real-world … this is with traffic this is true 500 miles.”

The video of this test run offers a look at life inside the cabin with drivers seated in the center and large touchscreen displays on either side. Designing the cabin around the driver in this way also allows them room to stand up and change clothes along with space for personal cargo storage and wireless device charging.

With an aerodynamic design that is more “bullet” than ""barn door"" Tesla claims the Semi uses less than 2 kWh of energy per mile (1.6 km). It has also developed new charging technology with liquid-cooled cables to deliver megawatt-class charging which Musk said will also be available for the Tesla Cybertruck when it goes on sale.

Deliveries are now underway Musk confirmed at the end of the presentation with the first cargo runs packed with snacks from PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay completed a day earlier.

But a new universal flu vaccine invented at the University of Pennsylvania might one day protect recipients against all types of flu virus. Read more

For years scientists have tried and failed to make a one-and-done vaccine that would provide at least partial protection against all types of the flu.

A University of Pennsylvania scientist now thinks he has cracked the case using the same technology that was the basis for the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines: messenger RNA.

In November Scott Hensley and his colleagues announced promising results from testing this universal flu vaccine in lab animals and now they are making plans to test it in humans.

The vaccine would not take the place of annual flu shots which are tailored to match the strains of flu circulating that year. Instead it would offer a baseline level of protection against the 20 broader types of the flu — likely not preventing infection in most cases but sharply reducing the risk of severe disease said Hensley a professor of microbiology at Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine.

“Can we make a vaccine that primes our immune systems against every influenza subtype including those that are already circulating in humans and also those that have not made the jump from animals?” he asked. “That’s really our goal here.”

» READ MORE: These vaccines could protect against many coronaviruses not just COVID

When scientists have tried to make universal flu vaccines in the past the formulas typically consisted of ancestral protein fragments that all flu viruses have in common. For a variety of reasons the immune system did not form a robust response to this lowest-common-denominator approach.

Hensley’s vaccine on the other hand consists of proteins from all 20 different types of the flu — or technically the recipe for the recipient to make those proteins spelled out with the four building blocks of mRNA.

That concept was first developed two decades ago by two of Hensley’s Penn colleagues Drew Weissman and Katalin Karikó who gained wide acclaim upon its first real-world success the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against COVID. Weissman also is among Hensley’s collaborators on the universal flu vaccine and separately he is working on various vaccines that would protect against multiple coronaviruses.

Scientists not involved with the flu vaccine experiments the results of which were published in Science say the Penn team’s approach seems promising.

In addition to allowing for the inclusion of 20 different kinds of proteins mRNA vaccines can be made more quickly than traditional vaccines. That’s a plus if recipes need to be tweaked in a pandemic University of Saskatchewan scientists Alyson A. Kelvin and Darryl Falzarano wrote in a commentary published in the same journal.

But getting such a vaccine approved may be a challenge according to Sarah Cobey a professor of viral ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago. The FDA typically requires a drug company to demonstrate that a vaccine prevents infections which would be hard to show when most types of flu are not in circulation she told STAT a health and science media outlet.

“The licensure path does not look straightforward to me” she said.

Still she said the results of the Penn flu vaccine were encouraging.

In addition to the ease of manufacture another advantage of the mRNA approach is that it seems to overcome a problem called original antigenic sin Hensley said.

What that means requires a bit of explanation:

The immune system forms a lasting memory of the first time it encounters a virus or a vaccine based on that virus. This initial imprinting is so strong that if a person is later vaccinated against a different form of the virus their immune system may nevertheless respond with antibodies that are more closely matched to the original exposure.

Call it the challenge of teaching an old dog new tricks immune-system edition.

But with Hensley’s universal vaccine when lab animals were exposed to fragments of all 20 flu varieties at once their immune systems appeared to form equally strong lasting memories of all 20.

The approach seemed to work both in animals that had never been exposed to any type of flu and in those with a previous exposure. In other words the 20-flavors-at-once approach seems able to override the strong initial memories — a phenomenon that Hensley and his lab members have jokingly referred to as “absolution” of the original “sin.”

“If the vaccine is given early in childhood it may provide an initial blessing of induced immunity” he said. “And perhaps this vaccine is also useful for absolution of original antigenic sin.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsaGVyYWxkLmNvbS90aGUtaGVsbGVuaWMtaW5pdGlhdGl2ZS0xMHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LWdhbGEtcmFpc2VzLTIyNDgwMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Hellenic Initiative 10th Anniversary Gala Raises $2248000,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thenationalherald.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /the-hellenic-initiative-10th-anniversary-gala-raises-2248000/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C49035B0A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsaGVyYWxkLmNvbS90aGUtaGVsbGVuaWMtaW5pdGlhdGl2ZS0xMHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LWdhbGEtcmFpc2VzLTIyNDgwMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzcG9zdC5pZS9uZXdzL3BmaXplci1jaGllZi1lMS0yLWJpbGxpb24taXJpc2gtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1pcy1qdXN0LXRoZS1zdGFydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer chief: €1.2 billion Irish investment is just the start,"Mike McDermott chief global supply officer and executive vice-president says Pfizer will continue to invest in its Irish operations beyond the major Grange Castle investment announced last week

Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand wants the courts to take temporary custody of the four-month-old baby so that he can have open-heart surgery using blood from the NZ Blood Service which may have come from donors vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus. A full hearing will be held on Tuesday in the High Court at Auckland.

The SMC asked experts to explain the science behind New Zealand’s blood transfusion procedures and policies and how the Pfizer vaccine interacts with our blood.

Dr Jim Faed Senior Lecturer Haematologist and Transfusion Medicine Specialist Department of Pathology (Dunedin) University of Otago comments:

When is direct blood donation allowed in New Zealand?

“‘Directed blood donations’ are blood donations that are arranged by an individual family or group of people for a named person; i.e. the blood donations are directed to the named person. Directed blood donations are rare in NZ. Most requests for directed donations have come from parents who wanted to provide blood for their newborn baby or infant before surgery or some other health procedure. In the past most requests have arisen from anxieties over the risk for HIV infection in the 1980s-90s and hepatitis C in the 1990s. However when the risks of being infected by one of these viruses by a transfusion in NZ are explained most accept that the risks are much smaller than imagined. Most parents have then accepted a transfusion of blood components provided by the Blood Service.

“However a reserve stock of blood components is always needed in case a patient’s requirements are greater than anticipated. If a reserve stock of blood is collected for a named person the ‘directed’ patient and is not used for that patient the blood cannot be transferred to the general blood component stocks.

“The issue for NZ Blood Service is likely to be – who pays for the service of setting up the arrangements and the cost of any blood or blood components that are not transfused? The Blood Service does not receive a funding grant from the Government. It is funded by charges to Public Hospitals for the cost of collecting testing processing and supplying blood components and products transfused in their region.

“In addition directed donations will not be available if a surgery date for a patient is changed to a later date and some or all of the items directed have expired or are no longer suitable. Changes to surgery dates are common if hospitals are overloaded and patients are admitted with acute conditions and occupy the surgery beds.

“Who will pay for the ‘directed blood’ that is not transfused? It is usual to have a buffer stock of extra blood components available in case unexpected surgery problems arise and more blood is needed. An extra buffer stock is easily managed in a volunteer blood donor and donation system. If not used for one patient the stock is held for the next patient. That will not happen for a ‘directed donation’ as it can only be used for one individual. Currently there is no system in existence to charge for unused blood. NZ law prevents charging patients directly for blood and blood components used for health treatments. The law does not envisage a system where ‘directed donations’ are not used.

“Finally the reserve stocks of special blood components – plasma platelets and cryoprecipitate are always available from truly volunteer donors. These are separate production and supply lines for whole blood and red cells. They are needed for some surgery procedures such as cardiac and other large surgery procedures and acute trauma patients. No system anywhere in the world as far as I know has a ‘directed donor’ system to supply all of these blood components. They are often needed in cardiac surgery and a need cannot always be anticipated.

“A question to be posed to those who believe that the Covid-19 vaccine will change the safety of blood is whether that applies to all blood components such as red cells platelets plasma and cryoprecipitate. A similar question is whether the highly purified processed blood products – Immunoglobulins Albumin and blood clotting factors are also affected. Answers to these questions are important as they will affect health treatments for many people.”

Why isn’t it recommended?

“Directed donation is not recommended for many reasons but the most important one for the recipient is the concern over safety. The safety of blood is a continuing focus for all Blood Services. Requests for directed blood donations raise additional safety issues. They arise because the ‘directed donors’ may consider themselves in good health and then decide they are safe to give blood. When they come to answer the blood donor questionnaire and the verbal questions in the standardised donor screening process a person may be tempted to answer ‘no’ – this does not apply to me instead of ‘yes’ – it does or could apply to me. People being screened before being accepted as a ‘directed donor’ may be tempted to give answers that will ensure they can give blood on that day. Failing to give the true (correct) answer will create a risk for the person who may receive a transfusion from that potential ‘directed donor’. Directed donations are therefore regarded as being less safe from infection and other risks by Blood Transfusion Specialists.

“The Blood Service and Blood Banks in Hospitals are required to store directed donations separately from volunteer blood stocks as the directed items do not meet the requirements for blood donor screening and some may have a higher risk for infectious agents. Directed blood donations are also kept separate so that they can be readily identified and sent to the appropriate Blood Bank for the planned surgery date. Separate storage is also required so that directed donations are not inadvertently given to other patients. Where humans are required to use manual systems to store multiple items separately mistakes can occur. Probably the greatest risk is that a voluntary donor blood component may be supplied instead of a directed donation. The reverse is highly unlikely.

“Issues of physical space availability arise in Hospital Blood Banks. If more than one person makes a directed donation request in a region the issue will rapidly become unmanageable for the local Hospital. Additional temperature-controlled storage facilities would be needed to keep the directed blood donations separate from volunteer blood and as separate lots for each directed patient. The refrigeration required is specialised must run at specific temperatures and be monitored with a complete record of temperatures; it is not a simple matter of popping down the road and buying another fridge. Many Blood Banks have limited space and cannot accommodate extra temperature-controlled storage facilities. I am not aware of anyone attempting to set up such a system anywhere in the world.

“Although the term blood transfusion is here to stay whole blood is rarely transfused in modern hospitals. Most hospital transfusions are given as blood components – red cells plasma platelets or cryoprecipitate. Occasionally a mix of several blood components is given in the proportions needed by an individual patient. Complex surgery procedures such as heart surgery often require specialised blood components such as plasma platelets and cryoprecipitate. Blood components are used to stop or prevent bleeding from various causes and if needed to replace red cells if anaemia is a problem. Transfusing blood components is the safest and most cost-effective way to provide for the transfusion needs of hospital patients. Blood components are obtained by the Blood Service from the blood donations given by volunteer donors. Some blood components require selected donors identified by the Blood Service as meeting the additional criteria. Whole blood is often used during cardiac surgery procedures on babies and small children and may be given to some people with severe bleeding after trauma.

“When ‘directed donations’ are requested it would be very difficult to plan to have directed blood components for a surgical procedure. A patient undergoing cardiac surgery may need one or more of these specialised blood components at the end of surgery to stop bleeding. Platelets have a high cost of collection testing and supply and the current approved price for Hospitals is greater than $800 for each item. The Blood Service is most unlikely to be willing to collect platelets from directed donors and have the platelets available on a just-in-case basis. Health issues would arise for an inexperienced donor.

“Ultimately there are no shortcuts to safety! That is why the Blood Service exists as a separate entity from the Hospitals and other Healthcare providers – to achieve the required levels of safety.”

Conflict of interest statement: “I am not employed by the NZ Blood Service (NZBS). I was involved from 1982-2020 in developing policies and operating standards used in New Zealand first in the Regional Blood Services until 1998 when the NZBS was established and then in the NZBS as a Transfusion Medicine Specialist.”

Immunisation Advisory Centre University of Auckland comments:

Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe?

“The Comirnaty (Pfizer) vaccine has been extensively used internationally and shown to have an excellent safety profile. For example Vaccine safety monitoring of mRNA vaccines for the first 6 months of the USA rollout included more than 298 million doses administered. The safety monitoring on this was noted to be “the most comprehensive of any vaccine in US history”. This established an excellent safety profile. This data is further supported by international meta-analysis which reviews multiple publications on safety data confirming the excellent safety profile.

“The vaccine has known short term reactions including injection site pain redness and swelling as well as systemic reactions such as fatigue headache muscle aches chills and fever. These are most often mild and resolve in 1 to 2 days. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) may also occur. The safety has been carefully scrutinised in the real world and in addition to the known reactions already mentioned the risk of anaphylaxis and myopericarditis rates are increased. Anaphylaxis may occur after any vaccination and is able to be managed by vaccination centres. The myopericarditis is generally mild but can have serious outcomes if not addressed. The rate of myopericarditis is higher after COVID infection than after the vaccination.

“While the viral vector-based vaccines produced by AstraZeneca and Janssen are both associated with thrombotic events the Pfizer vaccine (mRNA) used in New Zealand has not. These are different vaccines. Numerous studies including one performed in New Zealand have not found an increased risk of cardiovascular events due to clots with the Pfizer vaccine.

“There are numerous safety reports from our country UK Australia Canada USA and European

countries. The Medsafe Updated summary of risk management plan for Comirnaty (COVID-19 mRNA

vaccine) is an example of the close scrutiny being applied to the vaccine. In it Medsafe lists the

known risks (anaphylaxis myocarditis pericarditis) as well as potential risks.”

Can the products of the COVID-19 vaccine end up in the blood stream?

“Spike protein is the protein on the surface of SARS-CoV- 2 virus; the shape it forms gives coronaviruses their name (corona = crown). It is used by the virus to attach to cells in the airways to infect them and to spread from cell to cell. The SARSCoV-2 virus contains RNA that gives the body instructions to make new virus including virus spike proteins. These spread throughout the body during infection. Our body only makes these spike proteins when we are infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated with the mRNA code.

“The quantity of this spike protein produced after vaccination is much lower than the amount seen in people with COVID-19 infection with the virus spreading throughout their body. Furthermore as soon as it is produced this protein is dismantled inside specialist cells and the pieces are shown to the immune system in the lymph nodes nearest to the arm muscle when the vaccine was delivered. Research shows that most of the vaccine product stays in the muscle local lymph node and a small amount may travel to the liver (where all waste products are taken).

“Very low levels of spike protein (mean peak level 86 pg/ml) have been detected in plasma of people vaccinated for the first time with another mRNA vaccine (Moderna vaccine). This vaccine contains twice as much RNA as the Pfizer vaccine used in New Zealand. Spike protein was detected as early as day 1 after vaccination peaked on average 5 days after vaccination and declined and became undetectable by day 14 in all participants. No spike protein was detectable after the second vaccine dose.

“The quantity of this protein produced after vaccination is much lower than the amount seen in people with COVID-19 infection where the virus spreads throughout their body. No harm from antibodies from the Comirnaty vaccine being present in the blood stream. There is no evidence of harm from antibodies being present in blood which are produced in response to both natural infection and vaccination. Although unlikely to be present in blood products any components or products of the vaccine that may potentially be present in blood (lipid nanoparticles mRNA or the spike protein) would not be harmful if they were to be transferred through blood transfusion.”

Is there a concern about lipid coat in the vaccine?

“The low amount of vaccine product in a single dose limits the distribution of the RNA and lipid nanoparticles mainly to the injection site and to migrating antigen-presenting cells. Due to the transient expression of the RNA no persistent expression is expected. The lipids used in the nanoparticles including cholesterol are mostly normal products in the body or in our foods and medicines and are processed in the liver.”

Are there risk factors with donor blood?

“There are known risks associated with transfusions from donor blood such as an allergic reaction or the receiver of the blood becomes infected with a virus if the blood has not been effectively screened. This is not related to the COVID vaccination status of a donor. Although unlikely to be present in blood products any components or products of the vaccine (nanoparticles mRNA or the spike protein) would not be harmful if they were to be transferred through blood transfusion.

“Detecting mRNA in blood is unlikely. The mRNA is only very briefly in a person’s body (mainly in the muscle and nearby lymph nodes) after vaccination before being broken down by widespread enzymes. It is unlikely there is any detectable mRNA in the small volume of a person’s blood that is given when donating blood. There has been no recorded international concerns with use of donor blood from COVID vaccinated donors and COVID vaccines have been used extensively internationally.”

“Once outside of its lipid bubble mRNA is quickly destroyed by enzymes (ribonucleases) found everywhere including inside and outside of our cells. It only has a day or two to do its work. The mRNA is transiently expressed does not integrate into the genome and is degraded by physiological pathways- there are numerous enzymes present in our cells for this. The components of the lipid bubble are also cleared from our body as a waste product. The quantity of this spike protein produced after vaccination is much lower than the amount seen in people with COVID-19 infection with the virus spreading throughout their body. Furthermore as soon as it is produced this protein is dismantled inside specialist cells and the pieces are shown to the immune system in the lymph nodes nearest to the arm muscle. Given these facts checking the presence of spike protein and then distinguishing if the spike protein has been produced in response to either vaccine or virus would be very difficult and have no clinical purpose.”

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will participate in a pilot test of a digital dollar to counter the challenge posed by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin by evaluating the rollout of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Citi HSBC Mastercard and Wells Fargo are among financial companies collaborating with the New York Fed’s Innovation Center in a 12-week proof-of-concept pilot using digital dollar tokens in a shared database to speed cross-border settlement in currency markets. The test will take place on a digital money platform known as the regulated liability network (RLN) using distributed ledger technology.

As part of the evaluation the project will explore the feasibility of a network of central bank wholesale digital money and commercial bank digital money on a shared multientity distributed ledger. According to the Fed the proof-of-concept will also test the feasibility of a programmable digital money design that may be extensible to other digital assets.

“The NYIC looks forward to collaborating with members of the banking community to advance research on asset tokenization and the future of financial market infrastructures in the US as money and banking evolve” Per von Zelowitz director of the New York Innovation Center said in a prepared statement.

The US lags behind other nations in developing a CBDC prompting critics to warn that the slow response could undermine US leadership in global financial markets. But the NY Fed cautions against interpreting the test as a shift in strategy.

“It is not intended to advance any specific policy outcome nor is it intended to signal that the Federal Reserve will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a retail or wholesale CBDC nor how one would necessarily be designed” the statement further noted.

The findings of the pilot project will be released after it concludes.

The complete list of financial institutions payments organizations and advisers involved in the project includes BNY Mellon Citi HSBC Mastercard PNC Bank TD Bank Truist US Bank and Wells Fargo. SETL and Amazon Web Services provide technology. Swift the global financial messaging service is also participating.

Wells Fargo — known for its logo evoking its heritage as a stagecoach line — plans to permanently close its main branch office at 150 N. Stone Ave. effective on Feb. 22 in response to evolving customer needs.

“We’re constantly evaluating the branch network and we make the adjustments based on several different factors customer needs market factors things like that” Wells Fargo & Co. Arizona spokeswoman Liana Enriquez said. “It’s just something that we analyze consistently based on customer trends and needs and we’ve seen more customers using the digital options and tools.”

Local Wells Fargo customers were advised of the change in a recent mailer.

There is another Wells Fargo walk-in branch about two miles northeast of the downtown location on East Speedway at North Warren Avenue Enriquez noted and another on East 22nd Street just east of Interstate 10.

In all Wells Fargo has 18 branch offices around metro Tucson.

Wells Fargo hasn’t decided yet whether to keep an automated teller machine downtown following the branch closure she said.

Enriquez said Wells Fargo plans to sell the 50000-square-foot building which was built by the now-defunct Southern Arizona Bank and Trust in 1957.

The building which features Italian Renaissance revival style façade with ornate arches and columns was acquired by Wells Fargo when it acquired Southern Arizona Bank successor First Interstate Bancorp in 1996. The planned closure of the Wells Fargo branch will leave three walk-in bank branches downtown operated by Chase PNC Bank and National Bank of Arizona.

In 2017 Bank of America closed its branch office at 33 N. Stone — a landmark building-on-stilts long known as the Bank of America Plaza — but it still has an ATM there.

Banks across the nation have been closing walk-in branches for years as consumers increasingly do their banking online.

In 2021 banks closed 2927 branches in the U.S. net of new branch openings up from 2126 in 2020 when the number of net closures rose for the first time in three years partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Arizona had a net decline of 26 bank branches in 2021 the research firm found.

Wells Fargo reported the most net closures in 2021 at 267 followed by U.S. Bancorp with 257 net closures.

Banks have accelerated plans to consolidate their branch footprints as the COVID-19 pandemic drove consumer use of mobile and digital services while low interest rates have pressured profit margins and forced a reconsideration of expenses S&P Global said.

Jim Gillies: This is almost an example I mentioned earlier where they took over a mountain no one else really knew they wanted and you've built a really nicely cash-generative business on top of that. Then as long as management makes good capital allocation choices with the cash they generate you can start getting some pretty decent returns.

[music]

Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill and that's Jim Gillies from Motley Fool Canada. Ricky Mulvey caught up with Jim and his colleague Iain Butler to talk about companies with unusual moats.

Some competitive advantages are well known but let's face it: some economic moats just aren't that obvious like utility poles engineering software even gentlemen's clubs. In this episode Jim and Iain talk about what makes something a moat and the metrics that can reveal a true competitive advantage.

Iain Butler: There's a lot of ways that a company can create a moat but I think that's really what it comes down to it's just your ability to sustain a competitive advantage over a long period of time. Is there any other fancy definition or way of describing it in your mind?

Jim Gillies: One that I like to refer to I'm not sure it's ever been really... the textbooks doesn't get equated to moat. Companies that go after industries that nobody else wants. I think we've got a few examples of that planned for you today but you took control of a mountain no one else knew they wanted. Then at the end of the day you realize oh this company controls this subspace. It doesn't have to be something terribly exciting and sexy like Internet security. Sometimes you can find it in some pretty weird little niche places that no one else realizes wasn't a great opportunity except one or two companies basically go in and seal it up for themselves.

Ricky Mulvey: We're going to get weird in a little bit. Jim I remember in some previous conversations about franchise businesses your personal favorite you said that you're okay paying a higher multiple on a franchise business because you know that it's a reliable check-cashing machine. How does a moat fit in your investing framework and do you ever find yourself saying ""You know what it might be worth paying for this overvalued company on other metrics because it has such a wide moat?""

Jim Gillies: Well one of the best things you can find of course if you can find one of those widening or nascent or super-wide moats if you can find that for the bargain price that's the holy grail. But yeah I'm fine... One of the symptoms of a moat company for me is they can generally have pretty good carte blanche in raising their prices controlling their prices.

We talked briefly before the show one example that I have a private company I know but they can charge pretty much whatever they want because when they talk to their customers there's something like 0.001% of the typical company operating budget so no one's going to care. They're just going to like oh if the supplier company decides to double or triple their price the customers don't really notice.

What ends up happening is moated companies if I can use that as a word moated companies tend to have pretty good pricing power. They tend to be very good cash generators. And then you hope they're good capital allocators of the cash they generate.

Iain Butler: I think just to build a valuation case I'm just trying to think through some examples that I've experienced over the past I think you really have to get into the small-cap world to find a valuation case when it comes to a moat. These megacap companies certainly have moats but valuation outside of crisis times in the market is rarely ever a reason to buy those companies.

Autodesk is one that comes to mind. It's a recommendation that we've made in Stock Advisor Canada. It's in several services across Fooldom. I wouldn't say there's a valuation case for Autodesk but I would say that there's an incredibly strong moat associated with Autodesk which I think in that case can overcome any valuation concerns that one might have.

Ricky Mulvey: Just for some context that's the one that a lot of engineers use where if you're building out a building and you want to make sure that your electrical engineers and your plumbing folks are operating on the same system.

Jim Gillies: This is my engineering ring as the former engineer on the panel let me tell you that the AutoCAD moat is very very real. It is basically all you learn to do and if you want to have portability from one job to another in the engineering space it's all Autodesk it's all AutoCAD.

Ricky Mulvey: It's difficult for the listeners to see. I just saw you sticking a finger up at me and not the other one.

Jim Gillies: You American types don't wear engineering rings but in Canada the engineer is a supposedly solemn ceremony where there's a Rudyard Kipling poem. It's less serious than they make it out to be when you realize when you go in but it's still fairly... It's supposed to be a commitment that engineers will not pass shoddy work will do the best for the public blah blah blah.

Ricky Mulvey: But I would talk about some obvious moats because there's some intro folks out there and I think it's a good way of illustrating how a company becomes essentially a megacap or a larger-cap company by just building either like a balance sheet up or just a vertically integrated system.

When I think of an obvious moat of a company you know I think I would actually go to Live Nation. They own Ticketmaster they own the venues they manage the ticket sales they manage the artists. If Jim Gillies you want to see Death Cab for Cutie it's a very important band it's not like easily substitutable for another jam band like Goose or the Dead and Company. You want to see Death Cab for Cutie you're going through Live Nation.

Jim Gillies: I have gone and I have recently twice.

Ricky Mulvey: Then to your earlier point Iain it's something you're going to pay for. I think right now the stock's trading at about 100 times earnings or something like that. When you think of obvious moats I know you've got one Iain so I'll start with you. What is just an obvious fastball straight-down-the-middle moat that you can think of?

Iain Butler: The company that pops right into mind is only a company that I've come to know over the past year. I suspect that if indeed we have some relatively new investors listening they will not have heard of it. It's a big company I don't have the market cap up handy right now. Dutch company by the name of ASML [Holding].

ASML essentially is the ground floor in the entire global semiconductor industry. They make the machines that go into the manufacturers of semiconductors and they're behind manufacturer semiconductors. Intel as a client Taiwan Semiconductor as a client. All these massive semiconductor companies are reliant on the machines that ASML makes and they have such a lead in technology.

That lead is expanding as each new generation of machine comes out. These are hugely expensive machines I think they're nine-figure machines for one. They sell 30 machines in a year or something like that. I don't even think anybody's even trying to compete with them. They're that far ahead and the capital is so intensive that it just doesn't make sense to compete with them. That's been a company that I've learned about again in the past couple of years that has just blown me away at its competitive strength and the depth of the moat there.

Ricky Mulvey: Let's move to some less obvious ones. I want to talk about pool equipment. You guys countered with rail ties and compressed wood. This is a company that makes utility poles which is a product that is quite literally grown on trees. We're talking about Stella-Jones.

Why is Stella-Jones a company with a hidden moat?

Jim Gillies: Well if you want me to take the first kick at it it's a company that both you and I have recommended on our respective services in Canada. If nothing else we apparently like railway ties and utility poles which of course are there.

Ricky Mulvey: And talking about them.

Jim Gillies: Yeah exactly. But seriously you get railway ties and utility poles. How excited are you? Or what do you call it? I think you Iain call them the national tree of Manitoba or something like that. The utility pole.

Iain Butler: Somebody wants called driving through Nevada on a mining trip once. That's what was pointed out. The telephone pole is the national tree in Nevada or the state tree of Nevada.

Jim Gillies: The state tree of Nevada. But it's a moat for similar reasons to what I discussed earlier where the dollar value of what they're putting in for railways. Railroads are massive massive capital-intensive businesses. That's part of why Buffett when and bought a railway for Berkshire Hathaway because we want to be able to reinvest tremendous amounts of capital at ideally high rates of return.

But to maintain these massive networks is a lot of money per year and the compressed wood the creosote-soaked railway ties there have been pretty much the same since the 1800s? I think I know there's concrete railway ties as well but these are fairly simple fairly localized. There's only a few companies that do this stuff and Stella-Jones happens to be I believe the largest one certainly in North America and they are able to essentially pass along their cost plus in inflationary environments. No one's good about and I lost the big railway company is not going to bat about an eyelash at what Stella-Jones is requiring to have them really happened pay.

You essentially have it's like the water chemistry example. Stella-Jones can push through their price increases maybe a little bit more for their pain and suffering and the railway companies are just going to ""Cool that's fine."" This is not a product that they're going to switch out for a young upstart competitor in the creosote-soaked wood comes along and says ""Hey we'll beat Stella-Jones's prices by 5%."" It's not going to go because you're not going to switch back and forth. They just going to go no.

On the utility side of things quite often municipalities have multiyear contracts with Stella-Jones to keep them supplied with the state tree of Nevada. I've always loved that line. This is a company that they've got products... We're going to get to a better example. But this is almost an example I mentioned earlier where they took over a mountain no one else really knew they wanted and you've built a really nice cash-generative business on top of that and then as long as management makes good capital allocation choices with the cash they generate you can start getting some pretty decent returns.

Ricky Mulvey: Do they have any? I've always seen utility poles as commodity and to be honest I haven't really seen utility poles and thought much of them. Are there any real competitors in this space or is this a market-share leader that has just completely claimed the mountain you just described?

Iain Butler: I think any competitors that are out there are minuscule in relation. They're sort of the big dog in the pound.

Jim Gillies: Yeah we've got a member of a couple of Fool services who we know because we've interacted a couple of times on Twitter and he does work for a competitor of one of like basically they go out and harvest the trees. He's in the tree harvesting business but for a competitor of Stella-Jones and he has only said in our brief conversations he's only had positive things to say about Stella-Jones and remarked on they're a hard company to compete against.

Ricky Mulvey: This is also a company though where growth is fairly predictable. They can project their revenue pretty well I would assume. But it's also a case where the company's valuation has gotten ahead of itself before. For the old retail folks what are the metrics to really watch with this company to make sure they're not paying too much for their utility poles?

Iain Butler: I think that's what's historical I mean so it was one of the best-performing stocks in the Canadian market up until a few years ago when it's flatlined a bit and that's right.

The multiple has historically been very high. It's not high now and it hasn't been high for a couple of years. I think at worst if you just can get this company for its growth prospects alone for consistent as you say predictable revenue stream growing with inflation and whatever else any contractual increases it can make great.

But I think there's a case right now especially when there's potential multiple expansion involved. Like historically it's sort of been at 20- 25-times-earnings type company and here we are half that. I think there's a good total return equation in play right now I think and it's one two where you could probably let it go when it does get more fairly valued. It doesn't necessarily have to be a buy-and-hold-forever type situation despite its competitive position.

Jim Gillies: Yeah. To build on that the valuation I think is really something you want to watch for this moaty company. And I think people should be aware of that they were doing very very well on the Toronto Stock Exchange and they kept on touting that even though it kind of stopped after about 2015. The company itself will put out a press release or a slide deck showing how oh they've beaten the market they beat the S&P 500 they beat the cap industrial index and the S&P TSX and then you look at how they did it. It's like well but that's a 10-year chart. Actually it was a nine-year chart when I was looking at it about a year ago.

And if you lopped off the first two years all of a sudden Stella-Jones went from a market smasher to I think from about March of 2015 through to the end of 2021 I think it's annualized return was about 0.7% because to Iain's point they had gotten out ahead of their skis valuation-wise. They'd become this darling and so people forgot about them and the stock meandered down. And so when we were looking at them and recommended them I don't remember what Iain you put them into Stock Advisor at. But by the time we came along to them and I think we went first in Gems if I'm not mistaken but Iain has talked about 25 times earnings was where these were hovering.

By the time we came along to them I think we're at about 11 times earnings so we got it at a much better price and then as Iain says we're looking for multiple expansions. Not only are they growing earnings and growing revenues and growing cash flows and paying you a higher dividend and buying back stock but maybe if they ever go back to that 25-times multiple we're going to get 100% 150% return on our cost basis just from the multiple expansion. Forget about the business growth. And that maybe doesn't sound great if you go back and look at the 2020 early-2021 growth-stock frenzy.

But historically that's the aberration in the market and we know grows 10% 11% annualized with dividends reinvested. This suddenly becomes a very good argument for buying Stella-Jones at roughly the present valuation level.

Ricky Mulvey: Next company could not be more different. This is a company that operates a chain of strip clubs nightclubs sports bars and restaurants. It's also a media and convention company that serves the adult club industry. It's RCI Hospitality formerly known as Rick's Cabaret.

Jim when you presented this first of all I had to make sure it was okay for us to talk about on the show. But second of all when you presented this I understand how this business is profitable but what I don't understand with RCI Hospitality is how it has a moat when it has quite a few competitors.

Jim Gillies: I'm going to suggest to you not only does it have a moat it's got multiple moats. I do thank you for kind of running it through the proper channels. Because it's a legal business but I obviously understand that there could be disparate opinions about this type of business and so of course no one has to own anything they're not personally morally comfortable with of course.

But in my particular town where I live in Southern Ontario there is one approved location for this type of business. It's actually housed -- it's not owned by RCI but I'm going to I get to why it applies to RCI here. It is owned by an individual. It's in a historically significant house for this town where I live. It's actually in a Heritage building. For the last two decades they've said to the city ""We want to move out to more to the industrial ends of town"" thing and we would sell you the business or sell you the building. And the city says ""We have grandfathered in there will be no more of these types of businesses approved in this town.""

Nothing has happened and the place is still where it has been for decades. That's a kind of moat. Literally if they close or move that service will be gone from the city and that's what's going on for RCI.

They quite often they own the only approved allowed grandfathered-in locale for gentlemen's entertainment club kind of thing. ""Strip club"" sounds so sordid. They literally have a localized government-granted and -enforced moat. They don't have to go out and advertise and try to beat back the competition coming in and setting up across the street from them or across... They're legislated in and so what ends up happening a lot of these things have also been sole proprietorships and RCI is going in and buying up the sole proprietorships or like individual businesses they're buying them up at relatively low valuations because it's another example of it's a mountain no one else realized they wanted. They're buying at 3 4 and 5 times EBITDA when they take over someone looking to sell one of these locales. They go in. They pay a relatively low valuation and they're grandfathered in.

Again whether you agree with the business model or not -- and I certainly can see the arguments on both sides to be honest with you -- there is some value in a localized government-granted moat and one of the best-performing stocks in North America in the past 75 years is Altria aka Philip Morris aka the Marlboro cigarette people. One of the reasons it's been so successful has been the tremendous external pressure against owning companies like that. It's kept it at a low valuation. That company as well they don't have to advertise cigarettes anymore. They don't have a lot of R&D budget. They make a ton of cash. They pay a ton of taxes they make a ton of cash and roll that cash continually into raising their dividend and buying back shares and they do so at a really low valuation because of the external pressure.

And that's what I mean what's unsaid here is since we started looking at RCI Hospitality about two-and-a-half years ago I think the stock... Because that's the same principle coming forward here is I said to Iain in the past this is probably even though given the controversial nature of the business it's probably not one we want to recommend. But I think it's worth looking at for people who don't mind the morality of the business. I think it's worth looking at because I hold RCI Hospitality as it's probably got one of the best and most comprehensive well-thought-out plans for delivering their free cash flow. What they're going to do with their cash in their whole capital allocation stack.

At this price we're going to seek tuck-in acquisitions. At this price we're going to seek dividends dividend hikes maybe a special dividend. At this price we're going to be looking to buy back shares. And I think they've done really really well. The CEO he was a big fan of the book The Outsiders which is all about capital allocation and rock-star companies that have done well with it. And he read that about five or six years ago and I think he embraced it as how he wants to run RCI Hospitality.

And so again you're focused where there's a lot of real good positives that we would like with a lot of stocks in the Foolish universe. But there is that business that maybe no one else wants and so you go that's an interesting combination to me.

Ricky Mulvey: It's a company you want to ask questions about and Glassdoor ratings are always something that can be juiced and you want to look with a more critical eye especially for a smaller-cap companies. 94% of employees would recommend working there to a friend. If this is your space it sounds like it has an incredibly high employee score I would say.

Let's move on to some final questions. I think the thing about moats and you were talking about this earlier with some companies is they can end up being stocks that you own but don't really pay attention to. And that's exactly the case with a company like Pool Corp. which is not selling pool supplies to consumers but rather businesses and it's not a stock I own but it's 20 times larger than its second competitor and that would give it I would say a pretty strong vote in a space in a hill that not too many people else are at or on.

Jim Gillies: Yeah. It's definitely I think I said before I actually own it and yeah I couldn't tell you the last time I went and looked at their filings. Just because it's not one that I worry too much about. I would encourage people who are interested in Pool Corp. go have a look at their historical returns how they've done in terms of returns on capital and then what they've delivered to shareholders. It's been -- to long-term shareholders. Again this is not something that you should be jumping in and out of I think. Iain?

Iain Butler: Actually you just raised a question that I threw into our notes ahead. Do either of you key on a specific metric to provide some indicate that a moat might be present? Is there is there any one number that you look to and go this is an interesting competitive situation potentially.

Ricky Mulvey: I'm honored you asked me but I have no idea. I'm going to punt this to Jim.

Jim Gillies: I'm going to say no disappointingly. I'm a cash flow guy so I look at cash.

Iain Butler: I think that's the answer. The two that came to mind when I was asking myself that question as I was looking at some of these companies that we threw into the air I think an improving margin is one. An improving operating margin indicates pricing power potentially and the ability to sort of get more out of your customers and what you're having to put into them cost-wise. I wonder about return on equity as well. Like a high return on equity might be an indication.

Jim Gillies: Maybe more return on capital. Because especially in a world where we've seen a lot of companies blow up their balance sheets with buybacks and yet that's going to keep your equity account low and it's going to float your ROE higher. Maybe more of a return-on-capital thing I would argue for.

Iain Butler: But I think that maybe the message then is it's a mosaic approach. There's no real like one thing that any of us are going to point to and go boom! Moat. It's like you got to understand the business.

Jim Gillies: I love the ""mosaic approach"" analogy. That's very Charlie Monger review. I think that's where I first heard that and I think that's great.

Special to The News-Messenger

Seventy-five years ago — give or take a year or so here or there — plenty of things were happening to impact life locally.

The Fremont Bypass and the Ohio Turnpike were both completed and the St. Lawrence Seaway was moving toward being able to pass ocean-going ships through. The 1956 Fremont ConSurvey Directory had this to say about the seaway: “When the great St. Lawrence Seaway is completed (1959) there is reason to believe northern Ohio in which Fremont and Sandusky County are located will reap the benefits of this enormous project.”

Also in Fremont and surrounding area a $2.9 million bond issue was approved for additional elementary school space and a new senior high school which was recently torn down as part of the latest new high school project. Back in 1956 the directory pointed out that “This development will bring a modern senior high school offering a comprehensive high school program.” Also in 1956 a new parochial high school — St. Joseph’s — was opened. And two years later a new parochial elementary school — Sacred Heart — opened as part of the new church campus on the east side of the city.

Whirlpool purchased Clyde Porcelain Steel in 1952

In Clyde Whirlpool Corporation purchased the Clyde Porcelain Steel Co. in 1952 and began producing washing machines there and then purchased the Bendix Corporation in 1954. The company has been a key industry for the county since.

The Fremont directory brings back many memories.

Rodger Young Park featured a popular swimming pool as well as ball diamonds; model airplane circles; horseshoe tennis and shuffleboard courts; outdoor dancing facilities; shelter houses and an amphitheater.

Greyhound buses and other “franchised” lines served the city regularly with stops at Tremper’s on West State Street between Front and Arch streets.

Fremont Post Office was considered a modern operation

The Fremont Post Office building which included a variety of government offices on the second floor was referred to as “a modern one in every respect.” Now the home of Pontifex the building stopped housing the post office when that government agency moved to a new home on Enterprise Drive north of the city.

At least that building still stands. Many others do not.

The Fremont Opera House stood mostly unused in the 1950s until it was demolished to make way for Liberty National Bank on the northwest corner of Arch and State streets. A series of banking firms followed until US Bank closed its office at that site.

Fremont’s classic old City Hall on the southwest corner of Arch and Croghan streets was torn down following the “funnel cloud aloft” storm of June 30 1977. Fourteen years later the News-Messenger completed its move from downtown to Cedar Street. That not-so-beautiful old building which was right across Arch Street from the old City Hall was later torn down to make room for the expansion of the Croghan Colonial Bank.

Another beautiful old building that came down in this time frame was the National Bank Building which stood at the southeast corner of Front and Arch streets where the Credit Union parking lot is now.

Other companies of note back then included The Howard Zink Corp. Paul E. Spieldenner the S.E. Hyman Company Herbrand the Fremont Foundry Consolite Fremont Savings Bank Gottron Brothers Price Lumber and Winters Hardware.

That’s just a few to jog memories of longtime Fremonters.

Swimming Australia (SA) confirmed receipt of the letter in response to questions from reporter Julian Linden in an Australian Daily Telegraph exclusive today.

The letter is signed by every state swimming association president in the country plus the Northern Territory as well as the national swimmer’s union and coaches and teachers’ association ASCTA. Basically just about everyone representing everyone that matters.

It’s just a couple of weeks since one of the legends of swimming Tracy (nee Caulkins) Stockwell lost the presidency at Swimming Australia in a vote underpinned by a crisis in management of one of the national federation of the most successful women’s swimming team in the world at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

Linden writes in the Telegraph that “Australia’s signature sport is on the brink of mutiny because of an ongoing power struggle that’s trickled down from the highest levels right to the grassroots”. Swimming is a sport on “the verge of a full-blown revolt” Down Under.

News Corp got a copy of what was sent as a confidential letter to SA’s board of directors calling for urgent review from stakeholders saying they have lost faith in the way their sport is being managed. The explosive letter includes:

“It is our view the current culture and behaviours from the Swimming Australia executive do not align with stated values and strategic objectives.” Swimming Australia stakeholders – Photo: Australia is the world’s biggest wave in women’s swimming – pictured Cate Campbell in full flow (- by Patrick B. Kraemer / MAGICPBK

The Telegraph reports that some of the biggest movers and shakers swimming – all speaking on the condition of anonymity because they fear repercussions for going public – “have expressed major reservations about the leadership style of new chief executive Eugenie Buckley” who took over from another swim legend Alex Baumann when he stepped down suddenly last year on grounds of health.

The letter follows a a lead-balloon of a memo from Buckley to all the swim states and territories notifying them that their participation growth funding was being hacked in half for the next financial year. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back for stakeholders aware that Swimming Australia had lost the long-term and lucrative funding it had from Georgina Rinehart Executive Chairman of Hancock Prospecting a privately-owned mineral exploration and extraction company. Rinehart is Australia’s richest person her wealth reaching around A$29 billion in 2012 which at the time made her the world’s richest woman. She was listed by Forbes on its World’s 100 Most Powerful Women.

Rinehart recently withdrew funding from Swimming Australia while continuing to offer direct support for swimmers. Her precise reasons have not been divulged but stakeholders have indicated that there have been concerns over the difference between what they see as governing in the best interests of swimmers and governing on the basis of prevailing political issues and agendas in society at large. The transgender issue for example is one of those issues where sport and society cannot be treated in the same way because male advantage in female sport breaks the rules of Fair Play and sex-based discrimination.

Linden reports that SA’s latest financial statement shows a net loss of AUS$2.21 million.

Meanwhile Buckley previously in charge of Netball Queensland was hired initially by SA on an interim basis but landed the role permanently on January 1 this year “despite some board members apparently unaware she was being sued by a director at her former job” Linden reports.

University professor Marie Kavanagh commenced legal action against Buckley Netball Queensland and its company secretary and general manager of corporate services Ana Croger for allegedly defaming her. The case is ongoing.

SA’s new president Michelle Gallen who was voted in over Stockwell confirmed the board had received the letter and would meet with the aggrieved state representatives.

“Our States all have such diverse needs and diverse memberships” she told News Corp.

Australian s/c nationals in virtual mode for Covid-19 season –

“It is their job to advocate for what is in their best interests and it is our job to govern in the best interest of the sport as a whole so there will inevitably be some natural tensions in that relationship. We remain absolutely committed to open and honest dialogue with all our stakeholders to address any challenges while at the same time ensuring we continue to work together to ensure we propel our sport forward during this decade of immense opportunity.” Michelle Gallen Swimming Australia – image – sprinter Meg Harris courtesy of Swimming Australia

The crisis has erupted on the eve of the World short-course championships that get underway in Melbourne on December 13.

Gallen told Linden that the meeting with stakeholders would go ahead during the world titles.

Linden reflects the depth of crisis when he reports:

Just last month News Corp revealed SA had axed Tracy Stockwell as president but without notifying the taxpaying public that bankrolls the sport then replaced her with Gallen. Stockwell was just the latest high-profile departure from SA which has begun to resemble a revolving door – another telltale sign of the impending crisis. Her predecessor Kieren Perkins replaced John Bertrand as president in late 2020 but announced just a year later he was stepping down to take on a bigger role running the Australian Sports Commission. In 2020 less than a year before the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics Leigh Russell stood down as CEO along with Jacco Verhaeren quit as head coach. Other board members have also left some in protest at the way the sport is being managed raising concerns about the lack of transparency.

The luxury complex which is made up of 400 flats in five interconnecting blocks is also well known for its iconic rooftop jogging track which gives runners outstanding views of the Qatari capital.

During the World Cup rents for one-bedroom apartments are around £1600 per night while those with three bedrooms an eye-watering £2500 per night meaning hundreds of thousands of pounds of licence fee payers money is being spent on providing top class facilities for the BBC team.

Other BBC presenters and pundits also staying in the prestigious complex include former footballers Dion Dublin Martin Keown Ashley Williams Danny Murphy Vincent Kompany ex-Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino and Match of the Day 2 host Mark Chapman.

A number of the BBC's World Cup production team are also staying at the lavish complex which was completed in 2018.

The star team from the Beeb have become familiar faces in the adjacent café Flavours which serves up lattes fresh fruit juices and French toast.

It is not known how many staff the BBC has brought to Qatar and the corporation did not respond to a request for staffing numbers.

But according to available figures it took 272 for the 2014 Brazil World Cup. For the 2010 South Africa tournament BBC staff numbered 295 costing the corporation £20000 per person.

At the time the BBC was also slammed for spending a staggering £6million on its World Cup coverage.

Teacher Beth Martin 29 who lives in the complex told MailOnline: 'Since the BBC arrived it's been a hive of activity there are celebrities everywhere and on one hand it's been lovely.

'I feel that I have been living Match of the Day since the World Cup kicked off because it's so strange to see Lineker and other famous footballers in and around the complex each day.'

Ms Martin revealed how the BBC stars happily posed for selfies with her and her father Jeremy also a teacher who was visiting Qatar to attend England's World Cup match against Wales.

She added: 'My little footballing heart has been overwhelmed.

'It's incredible meeting these people who are my heroes. But it's not cheap to stay here because all of the prices have been increased for the World Cup.

'I can't imagine what the BBC must be paying to have all these people here?'

Another resident said: 'I have to pinch myself when I see Lineker and other stars in the building. The BBC lot are clearly enjoying themselves here because when they're not in the stadium on TV they're by the pool.

'This complex is usually very quiet just like the rest of Doha but it's been incredibly busy over the past few weeks.

'The only problem is trying to get a sunbed by the pool.

'Normally it's never a problem but these ex-footballers seem to get there first. They might be retired but they still move very fast.'

Despite a sequence of solid results in 2021 (Russell's podium double points in Hungary) Williams has struggled to stay afloat in Formula 1 in recent seasons.

The British squad's financial situation has been precarious for some time with former team principal Claire Williams spending many years trying to secure sponsorship for the team.

Eventually Williams was forced to sell the team to Dorilton Capital - facing the harsh realities of their increasingly unhealthy balance sheet.

In an effort to support the team during its financial struggles - before the recent takeover by Dorilton Capital - Williams agreed to a sponsorship deal with ROKiT ahead of 2019.

The Grove-based team's desperation to secure sponsorship was evident in the 2019 and 2020 campaigns signing Robert Kubica and then Nicholas Latifi to secure much-needed financial injections.

Nicholas Latifi's multi-year stint at Williams is clear evidence of the team's instability in previous seasons.

Returning to the issue of the sponsorship agreement with Rokit and Williams Rokit pulled out of its three-year contract with the team after just one season.

Rokit withheld the payments it owed Williams for the remainder of their contract which eventually saw the team take the case to court in search of arbitration.

It has been clear for some time now that the Grove-based team was in Pole Position to win this case and the California court has confirmed this.

The final judgement of the California court is that Williams will receive a total of £26220094.25 from ROKiT to settle this dispute.

Whilst Dorilton Capital's ownership of Williams has already provided the team with financial security this final judgement will be welcome news to the British squad all the same.",,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble is vacating its namesake Toronto office building.

The consumer goods company is downsizing from its 90000 sq ft office at 4711 Yonge Street. CBRE is marketing the concourse ground floor and second floor block at the Yonge and Sheppard tower which is owned by Menkes. P&G declined to comment on its move.

While pricing for the P&G office space was not available the asking net rent for the 15th floor is $21/sq ft on par with the average for the North Yonge submarket. Additional rent for the 23000 sq ft space is $23.61/sq ft. Suite 902 at 17000 sq ft asks the same.

As of the end of Q1 the office vacancy rate in the North York submarket was 24.7% higher than the Toronto North average of 19.3%.

The P&G block is available as of Feb 1 2025 and podium signage is offered. The space is being marketed towards life sciences companies and data centre operators. It offers 25 watts of power per sq ft.

The 16-storey Class-A office tower was built in 1987. It’s LEED platinum certified and has seven elevators car-charging stations and a café.

One underground unreserved parking space is available per 1000 rentable sq ft. Highway 401 and six GO Bus routes are nearby and there is direct underground access to the Yonge-Shephard subway station.

Production occurs at an Amazon warehouse in North Las Vegas on Thursday July 30 2020. (Elizabeth Brumley/Las Vegas Review-Journal)

When Amy Ogden started working in Southern Nevada real estate in 2006 warehouse tenants were mostly tasked with trucking goods to hotels and convention halls.

New projects also were poorly designed. Developers would squeeze a warehouse to the edge of its land resulting in tight parking bad loading areas and Ogden recalled it led to a nickname for such buildings.

“It was a broken box” said Ogden an industrial property broker with Logic Commercial Real Estate.

Firms still haul goods to the Strip but the region’s warehouse market has exploded in growth — making Southern Nevada much more than a place where people deliver food linens and the like to Las Vegas’ resort corridor.

Through a combination of factors including the huge growth of e-commerce available land and proximity to Southern California America’s casino capital has emerged as a competitive player in the warehousing and distribution industry.

Rising interest rates have taken some wind out of the market’s sails industry pros say and the U.S. economy has been wobbly. Plus any real estate deal and certainly any building boom comes with risks.

But over the past several years the local industrial market has undergone a transformation. Developers have flooded Southern Nevada with massive warehouse projects especially in North Las Vegas; more tenants have been distributing products to other states; fierce demand for space has pushed vacancies to record-lows; and a rising tally of developers and other investors started doing deals here.

“(It’s) really crazy how active this market has become” said Colliers International broker Dan Doherty a longtime industrial real estate specialist in the valley.

‘The secret got out’

Las Vegas’ warehouse market had been growing for years before the pandemic sent the sector into overdrive as the public health crisis sparked an accelerated shift to online shopping that fueled demand for distribution space.

Taylor Arnett first vice president of acquisitions at developer CapRock Partners said his firm and others have been leasing projects “as quickly as we’ve ever seen it in any of our careers.”

Four or five years ago it would typically take six to 12 months to lease a new project. Today he added it would be “strange” for a project to not have any leasing activity while still under construction.

Arnett whose firm has built around 2 million square feet of industrial space in Southern Nevada said it’s close to finishing another 700000 square feet. Most of that new batch is pre-leased he said.

Other signs of the warehouse boom:

— In September a footwear brand owned by clogs maker Crocs Inc. announced plans for a roughly 730000-square-foot distribution center in North Las Vegas — in a complex that broke ground this summer.

— A new industrial park near North Las Vegas Airport sold for more than $140 million in October the month after construction finished and was already fully leased.

— Last month VanTrust Real Estate announced it started construction on the first two buildings of a 350-acre project it’s developing in North Las Vegas’ Apex Industrial Park and it already signed a tenant for one of the buildings.

Overall Southern Nevada has around 153 million square feet of industrial space up from 123 million in 2017 according to data from John Stater Colliers’ Las Vegas research manager.

Much of the construction in recent years has been speculative meaning developers started projects without users lined up. But tenants have been plentiful. The market’s vacancy rate is just 1.3 percent down from 4.5 percent in 2017.

Keith Earnest executive vice president at VanTrust said he viewed Southern Nevada as a “sleeper” market years ago adding there “wasn’t much activity” in construction.

In recent years however other developers and landlords have entered the market.

“Unfortunately the secret got out” Earnest said.

‘It’s a gamble’

In the mid-1990s when Doug Roberts started working in Southern Nevada’s industrial market there were some regional and national tenants. But the market was mostly dominated by firms that supplied Las Vegas’ resorts and convention facilities he recalled.

New buildings also were typically smaller than what developers put up now. Back then a big project was 200000 to 250000 square feet said Roberts a partner with Panattoni Development Co.

Southern Nevada had a big wave of warehouse construction in the early- and mid-2000s as the broader real estate market surged on easy money. But after the bubble burst and the economy tanked industrial development largely ground to a halt.

Only around 52700 square feet of industrial space was completed in 2011 after developers built more than 42 million square feet from 2000 through 2008 according to Stater’s numbers.

Rob Lujan broker with Jones Lang LaSalle said site locators probably skipped over Las Vegas a decade or so ago because the recession had crushed the local economy so badly.

“A lot of real estate groups just shied away” he said.

In 2014 with the economy still limping out of the Great Recession Las Vegas consulting firm RCG Economics cited “a gap between supply and demand” that indicated an opportunity for more industrial space in Southern Nevada.

“But many developers are not constructing new buildings” the firm said in a report.

Later that year warehouse developer Prologis held a ceremonial groundbreaking for a project in North Las Vegas saying the new building at roughly 464200 square feet was the region’s largest speculative industrial project in years.

By 2015 other spec projects were in the works including by Panattoni.

“It’s a gamble there’s no doubt about it” Roberts told the Las Vegas Sun at the time. “But we think we’re right.”

Tenants move in

Las Vegas’ casino-heavy economy has long been fueled by tourism. But amid the growth of e-commerce distributors found reasons to set up shop here.

The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are about 300 miles away and truckers leaving Las Vegas can service about 20 percent of the U.S. population in a day’s drive industry pros say.

Developers could also buy huge chunks of land at relatively low prices letting them lure tenants with more affordable rents. Also industry pros say Southern California’s higher real estate prices tight availability of warehouse space and longer development timelines made Southern Nevada — long known for lower costs and lighter regulations — an attractive alternative.

Warehouse construction surged with more than 5.3 million square feet of industrial space completed in Southern Nevada in 2019 up from about 1.4 million in 2015 according to Colliers.

Companies such as e-commerce giant Amazon beauty retailer Sephora baby products maker The Honest Co. and sports apparel retailer Fanatics opened distribution centers here. Fanatics which opened its North Las Vegas facility in 2017 told the Review-Journal recently that it picked the location to serve its West Coast customers.

By housing merchandise for teams in Nevada California Washington and other states it has been able to “cut down on delivery times to these fans” a spokesperson said.

Tapestry Inc. owner of luxury brands Coach and Kate Spade unveiled plans last year to open a distribution center in North Las Vegas to also serve West Coast customers. Its fulfillment center is expected to span more than 788000 square feet and designed to annually distribute 22.2 million units and hold 4 million units of inventory.

Overall the number of tenants in Las Vegas from around the United States is “magnitudes higher than it was just 10 years ago” Colliers’ Stater said.

Amazon effect

Amazon has an especially big footprint with 15 locations in Southern Nevada the company said.

Its ubiquitous blue delivery vans can be seen all over the Las Vegas Valley and Amazon operates multiple big industrial buildings near Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

Landlords have paid rising prices for Amazon’s buildings there too.

In April a Boston investment firm acquired an 857000-square-foot Amazon warehouse for $226.4 million as part of a two-building acquisition along Tropical Parkway off Interstate 15 property records show.

By comparison in 2017 an 813000-square-foot Amazon facility sold for $73.4 million as part of a two-building purchase along I-15 at Lamb Boulevard.

Sam Bailey manager of economic development policy at Amazon told the Review-Journal that Las Vegas can serve the Mountain West region “quite well” and back up or support such markets as California and Phoenix.

He cited Las Vegas’ available land access to talent and geographic location that he said is conducive to routing goods.

As a result Southern Nevada has been able to “step forward as a competitive market for distribution and e-commerce” Bailey said.

‘Balloon is slowly losing air’

Southern Nevada also has a track record of going gung-ho for real estate. Over the last few years amid a surge of investor spending industrial property values were driven so high it was “almost comparable to the housing bubble” said CapRock’s Arnett.

But he added “the balloon is slowly losing air.”

The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times this year in a bid to fight inflation driving up real estate financing costs for everyone from homebuyers to commercial property investors.

Southern Nevada’s industrial leasing is “still strong” but sales have slowed said Lujan of Jones Lang LaSalle.

“Groups just can’t afford to pay what they once could for properties” he said.

Also people will continue to shop online but if e-commerce spending slows demand for warehouse space could be affected.

Stater noted that developers would face risks “if the economy goes south pretty badly” and tenants stop signing leases for new projects.

“The question then is when are your loans coming due? How long can you wait for the economy to come back?” Stater said.

For now demand for warehouse space is “outpacing supply” with firms still hunting for buildings said Earnest of VanTrust.

“With that vacancy rate you feel pretty confident” he said.

Government help

The huge growth in Southern Nevada's industrial market has been heavily fueled by the rise of e-commerce.

But government spending and tax breaks have also helped as local officials have sought to lure distribution firms and diversify the region's casino-heavy economy.

""You can't drive through Southern Nevada now without seeing some sort of warehouse or distribution center along the highway"" said Kris Sanchez deputy director of the Governor's Office of Economic Development.

GOED has approved tax incentives for multiple industrial projects in the Las Vegas Valley in recent years including more than $25 million for a Google data center in Henderson and more than $15 million for a Novva Data Centers location in North Las Vegas.

It also approved $10.5 million in tax incentives for a Haas Automation complex in Henderson; more than $8.6 million for shoe brand Hey Dude's distribution facility in North Las Vegas; and $2.9 million for a North Las Vegas distribution center operated by Kate Spade owner Tapestry Inc.

In North Las Vegas where developers have been launching waves of big warehouse projects taxpayer dollars have helped expand the city's infrastructure enabling more construction.

In April 2017 for instance North Las Vegas City Council approved plans for about $43 million worth of street water and sewer projects in the Las Vegas Motor Speedway area which has been an especially popular spot for warehouse construction in recent years.

In September 2017 the U.S. Economic Development Administration spent $3 million for a sewer project in North Las Vegas that was designed to serve the ""growing area"" east of Interstate 15 and the 215 Beltway and north of Las Vegas Boulevard the agency said.

The project was slated to ""increase capacity and provide stability"" which was ""expected to lead to the expansion of several major manufacturing and logistics companies"" according to the EDA.

In 2018 the city of North Las Vegas teamed with a landowner on a 12-mile water pipeline project in Apex Industrial Park which after plodding along for years with little development amid a dearth of infrastructure has seen a burst of activity over the past year or so.

The Nevada Department of Transportation also awarded a $99 million contract in early 2020 for the construction of ramps flyovers and street connections at the Beltway/I-15 interchange in North Las Vegas.

North Las Vegas City Manager Ryann Juden said the city competes with markets outside Nevada for companies. But sometimes infrastructure will only count for so much when trying to recruit new employers given Nevada's consistently low-ranking public education system.

""That is a major hurdle that we have to cross all the time"" Juden said.

Apex comes to life

With the warehouse market booming in Southern Nevada more developers have ventured to North Las Vegas' Apex Industrial Park a rare surge of momentum for the remote area.

Apex off Interstate 15 at U.S. Highway 93 has been around for decades and offers thousands of acres for potential projects. But for a long time construction activity was scarce amid a dearth of infrastructure.

However utility service has been expanding to the area and over the past year or so multiple companies have bought land and pushed ahead with construction plans in the industrial park some 20 miles northeast of the Strip.

The increased activity at Apex also comes amid higher land prices and the depleted availability of project sites in the northeast valley's Las Vegas Motor Speedway area a popular warehouse construction spot in recent years.

Reno developer Dermody Properties broke ground last year on a 664300-square-foot distribution facility in Apex; aluminum beverage can maker Ball Corp. unveiled plans last year to build a plant at Apex; developer VanTrust Real Estate bought roughly 350 acres last year with plans for a 4.5 million-square-foot industrial park; and grocery chain Smith's purchased nearly 100 acres last year.

NorthPoint Development broke ground this summer on an industrial complex that's expected to span more than 2 million square feet. Hey Dude a footwear brand owned by Crocs Inc. unveiled plans to open a distribution facility in the project.

Rob Tecco vice president of North American distribution and logistics at Crocs Inc. said in September that the property size it needed wasn't available in other parts of the Las Vegas Valley.

""Everything else was spoken for near the Speedway"" he said.

Despite its quite high weight the Huawei Nova 10 Pro makes a slim impression in the hand. This is due to the rounded display edges on the long sides. Although the camera setup clearly protrudes from the casing and looks quite bulky the smartphone is still well-balanced.

The matte back is insensitive to fingerprints and looks chic but it does not feel as high-quality as we would expect from a smartphone in this price range. The build quality on the other hand is really good. The gaps are tight and even. Only the SIM slot's cover is slightly recessed in the frame and does not close flush. There is a rubber seal on the SIM slot but the Nova 10 Pro does not have a designated IP certification.

In general the Nova 10 Pro lacks a few premium features in terms of equipment.

It turns out that the designs are the result of an official collaboration between the brand and VAIN a freshly launched Helsinki-based fashion label run by designer Jimi Vain representing an interesting new entry into a years-long trend that’s seen big names like TELFAR and Forever 21 pair with fast casual chains like White Castle and Taco Bell. The goal? Come up with bizarre lighthearted new garments to be sold at accessible prices.

Unlike luxury labels like Gucci and Ralph Lauren which have lately begun branching out into the culinary space with Michelin star-courting restaurants and branded cafés slightly less prestigious fashion brands are tapping into the populist power of food via collaborations with beloved chains. Not everyone can afford a meal at Gucci Osteria Tokyo but almost everybody can shell out for the occasional Big Mac; that relatability engenders deep emotional bonds with consumers even in spite of scandals or criticisms of the fast food company.

McDonald’s has been consistently taken to task over the nutritional value of its food (or lack thereof) its environmental practices and its poor treatment of workers. In November the owner of seven McDonald’s locations in Brooklyn was ordered to pay $1 million to 511 employees at the fast food chain whose workers rights were violated; some employees were prevented from taking paid sick leave.

“The project does not comment on McDonald’s as a company” Vain told The Daily Beast. “For us it was a fashion project together with a brand that was important for us in our childhood and we focused on our task to design the clothes out of recycled workwear.” McDonald’s did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.

“As kids growing up in the no man’s land that is rural Ostrobothnia everything felt so far away” Vain said. “A McDonald’s along the local highway is what we had in common with the western world and beyond. When I lived in the countryside the only way I could get to McD was by moped: that’s the idea behind the motorcycle jacket.”

There are 13 items in the VAIN x McDonald’s capsule collection in total; other standouts include a striped logoed dress with a Peter Pan collar and a skirt constructed out of layered McDonald’s belts. One could imagine Julia Fox the queen of bizarro street style rocking the apron-style minidress with ease.

“McDonald’s reached out to us through a marketing agency asking for collaboration for a clothing line” Roope Reinola VAIN’s CEO told The Daily Beast. “We had full creative freedom as the brand guidelines were our only boundaries.”

“The brand boundaries were related to guidelines such as how the logo was used in the clothes and colors” Vain said.

In 2019 Balenciaga released a McDonald’s french fry carton-inspired shoe begging the question of whether Vain had the Spanish luxury brand in mind when creating his capsule collection.

“Not consciously” Vain said. “I don’t deny that Demna wouldn’t be an inspiration in my career. He has changed the fashion industry a lot with his work. I don’t see that much Balenciaga in the collection but I can understand it.”

Plus if there’s anything about pop culture in the last couple of years that could likely be universally agreed upon it’s that high and low culture have become so thoroughly blended that it’s now almost irrelevant to try to differentiate the two. Balenciaga sent a purse inspired by Lay’s chips bags down the runway in Paris this October guys.

———————–

Brian Cole president of Signature Private Wealth Management has led the investment division of Signature Bank of Arkansas since starting it from scratch in 2006.

In 2002 Cole managed the investment and trust division for Arvest Bank in Fayetteville when the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal named him to the Forty Under 40 class.

Cole left Arvest to start Signature Bank’s investment division one year after Gary Head president and CEO of Arvest’s Fayetteville market started Signature Bank.

“We opened a Raymond James office for Signature Bank back in May of 2006” he said. “At the time it was just my assistant who came with me from Arvest and me. We have six financial advisers including myself and we manage $500 million in assets.”

Most of those assets are managed for Northwest Arkansas clients but the office has clients nationwide from California to South Carolina. It has about 1700 accounts and manages assets for about 700 households. Total revenues have risen to more than $3 million annually.

Along with his role as president of Signature Private Wealth Management Cole serves clients as a financial adviser and is the branch manager for the Raymond James office. He oversees five advisers and a sales assistant and manages the recruiting and compliance for the office.

“We have a unique setup here to most brokerage offices in that our group functions more as a team” he said. “We’re not a group of investment advisers competing against each other for business. We function as a team which provides a better alternative for the client because they’re not just getting one person’s opinion about what they should do with their investments.”

Multiple advisers can provide advice to clients and they can speak to anyone on the team he said. Each client has a key adviser with whom they work but the advisers help each other with their clients.

Cole’s office is at the Signature Bank location in Fayetteville and Signature Private Wealth Management also has offices at the bank’s locations in Bentonville Rogers and Springdale. It has plans to open offices at the bank’s new locations in Harrison and Jonesboro. He also wants an office at Signature Bank’s bilingual bank Banco Sí.

“I think that’s going to be a tremendous opportunity for the bank” he said. “It would be a huge opportunity for our group as well.”

Before joining the financial services industry Cole was an attorney for six years. He spent the first two years after earning his law degree as a deputy prosecuting attorney for Benton County and was in private practice after that.

He said he handled estate planning and had good clients including a bank but wasn’t enjoying the work. He joined the bank after its president asked him to come on board following the departure of the person managing its trust division. He earned his securities licenses in early 2002 and developed an interest in managing money.

“When I had the opportunity to leave Arvest and start the investment division for Signature it seemed like the thing to do” he said. “Without question the best career decision I ever made.”

He was grateful to Head who hired him at Arvest and Signature banks for having trust and confidence in Cole. Without Head Cole said he likely wouldn’t have taken those opportunities.

“I feel very lucky to still work with him on a daily basis” he said. “He and I office very close together here in the bank.”

Cole 54 said his background as an attorney has helped with estate planning and speaking to clients about wills and trusts. Advisers coordinate with clients’ attorneys to complete the documents and Cole said he’s involved in the process from beginning to end.

While he no longer practices as an attorney he maintains his Arkansas law license.

After reaching the $500 million mark earlier this year he said his next big goal is to reach $1 billion in assets under management.

Cole and his wife Missy have five children. An avid golfer he said his eldest plays golf professionally while the second oldest plays in college.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvc2VtaW5vbGVzLzIwMjIvMTIvMDQvZnN1LWZvb3RiYWxsLW9rbGFob21hLXNvb25lcnMtYm93bC1nYW1lcy1mbG9yaWRhLWdhdG9ycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FSU to face Oklahoma in Orlando Florida Gators headed to Las Vegas Bowl,"Florida State will be playing Oklahoma in Orlando’s Cheez-It Bowl in a matchup of two of the most storied programs in college football history.

The Seminoles (9-3) enter the postseason ranked No. 13 in the Associated Press poll and the final College Football Playoff rankings. They’re vying for their first bowl victory since blowing out Southern Miss in the 2017 Independence Bowl.

Oklahoma (6-6) was one of the most disappointing teams in the nation under first-year coach Brent Venables. The Sooners started the season in the top 10 and rose as high as No. 6 before stumbling in a deep Big 12. Their quarterback is Dillon Gabriel the former UCF star; he has thrown 24 touchdown passes in 11 games this season.

It will be the teams’ first meeting since a 2011 top-five matchup at Doak Campbell Stadium — one of the best home environments FSU has had since Bobby Bowden’s glory days. Their last bowl showdown was in the Orange Bowl for the 2000 national championship (which Oklahoma won 13-2).

The Florida Gators are headed to the Las Vegas Bowl where they will face No. 17 Oregon State on Dec. 17 in the Raiders’ Allegiant Stadium. It will be the first time the programs have met. The 9-3 Beavers will have a shot at their first 10-win season since 2006. Led by fifth-year coach Jonathan Smith Oregon State has a top-40 scoring offense and defense. The Beavers have only faced four SEC teams and none since a trip to LSU in 2004.

UCF meets Duke in the Military Bowl on Dec. 28 at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Maryland. The Knights are competing for their eighth 10-win season in program history.

The Gasparilla Bowl will pit Wake Forest against Missouri at Raymond James Stadium on Dec. 23. The Demon Deacons started 6-1 and reached the top 10 nationally before fading down the stretch to finish 7-5. Missouri won its final two games to finish 6-6.

Tampa’s other bowl game the ReliaQuest Bowl will feature Illinois against No. 24 Mississippi State. The game formerly called the Outback Bowl will be Jan. 2. at Raymond James Stadium. The Illini finished the regular season 8-4 — their best record since the 2007 Rose Bowl run while the Bulldogs (8-4) have a shot at finishing the season ranked for the first time since Dan Mullen’s final year (19th in 2017).

Mizzou will travel to Tampa Fla. to face the Wake Forest Demon Deacons in the Gasparilla Bowl sponsored by Union Home Mortgage. This will be the Tigers' second consecutive year going to a bowl game.

The Gasparilla Bowl will kick off on Dec 23 at 5:30 p.m. (CT) in Tampa Fla. at Raymond James Stadium home of the South Florida Bulls and the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Fans watching from home will be able to tune in on ESPN for the sunset showdown.

Missouri has some momentum coming into the bowl season but it hasn't won a bowl game since 2015 when the Tigers took down Minnesota in the Citrus Bowl. Getting a victory here would be huge for head coach Eli Drinkwitz heading into his third offseason at the helm. It may not exactly be the Sugar Bowl but hoisting any kind of hardware is a bonus come contract extension time.

Like the Tigers the Deacs went 7-5 in 2022 finishing sixth in the ACC. They closed their season by losing four of their last five contests but should have a renewed sense of purpose with bowl game bragging rights on the line. Wake Forest is led by quarterback Sam Hartman who's thrown for 3421 yards and 35 touchdowns this year. The Deacons' passing attack will pose one of the toughest challenges that Missouri has faced this season but the talented Tigers' defense should be more than up to the task.

Although it's been seven years since Mizzou pulled off a bowl win the Tigers' last triumph did coincidentally come in the state of Florida (2015 Citrus Bowl-Orlando Fla.) so that has to count for something. The Tigers will have just about three weeks to prepare for the Gasparilla Bowl and it's likely that they've already gotten to work. Come game time this 2022 Mizzou squad will have one more chance to show the world what they're made of.

While the GeForce RTX 3060 8 GB contains the same GA106 GPU as its 12 GB sibling NVIDIA's memory changes significantly hamper in-game performance.

4 Reviews

Hardware Unboxed has outlined the performance of the RTX 3060 8 GB which NVIDIA announced last month with a new RTX 3060 Ti. While the latter received a GDDR6X VRAM upgrade the RTX 3060 8 GB has 4 GB of VRAM less than the original RTX 3060 as well as a narrower 128-bit memory bus. As a result the RTX 3060 8 GB delivers 240 GB/s of memory bandwidth two-thirds of what the original RTX 3060 manages. Unsurprisingly the newer RTX 3060 falls short of its older namesake in benchmarks despite containing the same GA106 GPU.

According to Hardware Unboxed the difference between the two models is stark in certain titles. As the YouTube channel discusses in the video below the RTX 3060 8 GB offers up to 35% worse performance in some modern triple-A titles like Dying Light 2 than the original RTX 3060. However a 17% gap exists between the pair in a dozen games tested at 1080p. A similar gap exists at 1440p too with Hardware Unboxed using these resolutions to prevent VRAM usage from being a bottleneck.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvMjU4MS1udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwNjAtOGdiL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 8GB: Why You Should Avoid It,"Do you remember that time when Nvidia ""unlaunched"" a product stating that despite being a fantastic graphics card it wasn't named right?... ""Having two GPUs with the same RTX 4080 designation is confusing."" That's right we're talking about the ""unlaunching"" of the 12GB RTX 4080 about two months ago.

For those of you not up to speed when Nvidia announced their latest GeForce 40 series they did so with three products: the flagship RTX 4090 the RTX 4080 16GB and RTX 4080 12GB. The problem was that the two RTX 4080 variants were very different and those differences were not limited to memory capacity as the naming scheme was hinting.

That's because in order to cut down the memory capacity without using lower density chips you also need to reduce the memory bus width. Using different silicon that would result in substantially different performance was not a good move but this sort of dodgy behavior wasn't new. Nvidia had done it before for example with the DDR4 version of the GeForce GT 1030.

The big mistake was announcing the RTX 4080 12GB and that particular anti-consumer move to the world in the biggest event Nvidia had held in years. Traditionally how they like to handle dodgy product releases is to sneak them out at a later date via a silent launch meaning far fewer people notice and even fewer seem to care.

Well this is exactly what they have done with the 8GB variant of the GeForce RTX 3060. Ironically they launched this product on October 27 just 12 days after unlaunching the 12GB 4080 for having a confusing name.

Although it's true that both the 8GB and 12GB variants of the RTX 3060 are based on the GA106 silicon – so it is technically the same GPU – the changes still go well beyond an adjustment to memory capacity. The memory subsystem of the 8GB model has been drastically reduced the L2 cache is 50% larger for the 12GB model as is the bus width. All in all bandwidth is 61% greater in the original RTX 3060 model producing 360 GB/s whereas the ""new"" 8GB variant has been slashed to just 224 GB/s – the same bandwidth as the RTX 3050.

Ultimately this means the 8GB RTX 3060 is going to be slower than the 12GB model – and spoiler alert it's ~15% slower on average – but in some instances we're seeing margins of over 30% so it's a big enough deal for us to bring it to your attention.

One additional note Nvidia hasn't made any official adjustments to MSRPs so the 8GB RTX 3060 still comes in at $330. Looking over at Newegg we can see that the 12GB RTX 3060 starts at $350 with a number of models available for between $350 and $380. Meanwhile the most affordable 8GB variant comes from Inno3D and it starts at $385 though there are some Asus models on backorder at $360 and $370. Point is in terms of pricing there's no distinguishing between the original 12GB models and these new gimped 8GB versions.

In Australia we bought a Galax model that we purchased for a 10% discount from the original 12GB version and you might think ""Well that's okay"" but it's not. The GeForce RTX 3060 was released almost 2 years ago everyone is familiar with how it performs and those that aren't can quickly consult the bevvy of online benchmarks. Meanwhile this new 8GB model is nowhere to be found as there isn't a review program it's up to reviewers to purchase the card and inform consumers.

In fact you might not even know there was an 8GB version or simply assumed the RTX 3060 only came with 8GB of VRAM just as the 3060 Ti does. The trap here is that unsuspecting consumers could be baited into paying RTX 3060 12GB money or very near so for a product that's significantly slower.

We asked Nvidia for an official response about why the 8GB version was released and they simply said it was to offer customers more options. They also stated that the 12GB version was going to remain available in parallel. And just to be clear this is an Nvidia sanctioned product and not their partners going rogue rather it's possible partners are obligated to produce it.

Nvidia appears to be looking to clear out their inventory of lower-end Ampere GPUs and are no doubt keen to maximize profits as they do so. This also allows them to sell defective GA106 silicon for far more than they would get selling it as an RTX 3050.

Our issue is of course that we now have two products called ""GeForce RTX 3060"" and they don't deliver the same level of performance and in many instances it's not even close. And we're not talking about memory bound testing – as in exceeding the 8GB VRAM buffer – we're talking about performance when remaining well within the 8GB buffer.

So let's take a look at that we'll go over a few games and then show you a 12 game average. For collecting these results we used fresh data with both 12GB and 8GB RTX 3060 cards using the latest display drivers. Other GPUs are included for comparison purposes.

Benchmarks

Starting with Cyberpunk 2077 we find that the 12GB model is 13% faster at 1080p when compared to the new 8GB model not a massive difference but it's certainly noteworthy.

That margin grows to 18% at 1440p and now we're looking a two different tiers of performance and a noticeably better gaming experience with the original 12GB model.

Moving on to Dying Light 2 here we have a game that is clearly memory heavy and as such the 8GB model limits the performance of the RTX 3060 GPU.

The original card was a massive 35% faster at 1080p that's a tremendous performance difference for two products sharing the same name and it's the same story at 1440p. In fact here we go from a very console-like 34fps with the 8GB version to a much smoother 46 fps using the original 3060.

Halo Infinite sees the 12GB model offering 21% greater performance at 1080p going from 63 fps to 76 fps another big performance difference for two products that share the same name. The margin remains similar at 1440p where the original 12GB 3060 was 19% faster.

Horizon Zero Dawn sees a smaller 16% performance improvement for the 12GB model over the new 8GB version though that margin did grow to 20% at 1440p.

Both results are bad as a double-digit change in performance is unacceptable especially given the difference in memory capacity plays no role here.

We're also looking at 22% greater performance for the 12GB variant in Shadow of the Tomb Raider as the new 8GB model drops performance to 85 fps. The margin is similar at 1440p where the 12GB version is 20% faster rendering an additional 12 fps.

Performance Summary

That's enough with the individual game results you can easily get the idea. On average you can expect 17% better performance with the 12GB model at 1080p but as we saw that margin can be as high as 35%...

It's a similar story at 1440p when working within the 8GB buffer the 12GB model was still on average 18% faster as it enjoys significantly more memory bandwidth.

What We Learned

The new 8GB version of the GeForce RTX 3060 is noticeably slower than the original and in a number of instances was significantly slower in our testing. In our opinion this is a horrible anti-consumer move by Nvidia it serves little more than to line their pockets while misleading and potentially ripping off customers.

It's true that pricing could be improved at which point it might not be bad in terms of value. After all let's say Nvidia drops the price relative to the 12GB version by 20% or even 30% then the 8GB RTX 3060 would start looking pretty great in terms of value at least compared to Nvidia's own product stack.

We would agree with that assessment had it been called let's say the ""GeForce RTX 3060 LE 8GB"" something that makes it clear to prospective buyers this isn't your typical RTX 3060. In that case we wouldn't really have a problem with this cut-down model and while we'd still prefer a name change entirely we could at least accept a more honest attempt at making it clear to buyers that this is a different version.

To demonstrate just how difficult it is for the uninitiated to even tell which model they're buying or that there is even a different model here's the box for our original RTX 3060 and the new 8GB box...

Those operating under the assumption that an RTX 3060 is an RTX 3060 might see an 8GB model selling for a reasonable discount and think they've stumbled upon a bargain snap it up only to realize their bargain is quite a bit slower than it would have been otherwise. And for those none the wiser it just means you could have done better and possibly gone further between upgrades.

Unfortunately this sort of behavior will continue unless Nvidia faces enough backlash from consumers and the enthusiast community. We're always going to fight against this sort of anti-consumer behavior from corporations whether it be Nvidia AMD Intel LG Samsung MSI Asus and so on many of these companies we've taken to task in the past and we'll continue to do so.

Rest assured if AMD was to pull a similar stunt we'd go after them just as hard much like when we dedicated several articles to call them out over the plans to axe Zen 3 support for 300 and 400 series motherboards. We were having none of their excuses we didn't buy into the technical reasons for why they had to end support. Put simply they misled consumers we went after them and they corrected course and this was made possible thanks to strong push back from the community.

When Nvidia announced the GDDR6X variant of the RTX 3060 Ti it also announced the RTX 3060 8GB model. Unlike the former this one looks to be a considerable downgrade over the original model. The first reviews are coming in and overall the lower-memory card is about 15% slower than the 12GB model.

The first review from a reputable source comes from HardwareUnboxed who tested both cards on various games at 1080p and 1440p. These resolutions were chosen to avoid VRAM bottlenecks during testing.

At both resolutions the 8GB RTX 3060 was the slower of the two. That was only expected considering the 8GB model has a smaller 128-bit memory bus compared to the 192-bit memory bus of the original RTX 3060. All other specifications remain the same memory and clock speeds CUDA core count and TDP.

Based on this testing the RTX 3060 12GB averaged 110FPS (91FPS at 1%) at 1080p and 79FPS (65FPS at 1%) at 1440p. On the other hand the 8GB model averaged 94FPS (78FPS at 1%) at 1080p and 67FPS (54FPS at 1%) at 1440p. These results put the 8GB model 15% slower than the 12GB variant.

KitGuru says: With the performance difference perhaps this should have been an RTX 3050 Ti instead.

Key trends

More than 15.3 million people are in dire need of life-saving health assistance in 2023 a 3.2 million increase from 2022.

The weak fragile and disrupted health systems with concurrent public health emergencies and numerous challenges affect not only the access availability and quality of health services across Syria but also the physical and mental well-being of the vulnerable population.

According to WoS HeRAMS 2022 Q2 analysis 41 per cent of public hospitals are either not functioning or partially functioning while 43 per cent of primary health care (PHC) facilities are either partially functioning or not functioning at all. Compared to Q2 2021 there is a notable decrease in hospitals and health facilities (HFs) providing services of BEmONC (-32%)  CEmONC (-21%) blood bank services (-15%) dialysis (-13%) and tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment (-9%).

The increase in 2023 PIN is attributed to the recurring disease outbreaks a change in the methodology to be more proactive rather reactive and focus more on services availability and deteriorating socio-economic status of the communities which resulted in increased displacement and worsened determinants of health thereby negatively impacting health outcomes . In addition to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recurring infections  a cholera outbreak was declared by MOH Syria in September 2022 . The outbreak is spreading fast and as of 5th November 2022 33567suspected cases and 2002 confirmed cholera cases including 92 associated deaths (CFR 0.3%) have been reported from all governorates in Syria .

The uncertainties around the renewal of the cross-border resolution the impact of the regional and global instability such as the Ukraine crisis and economic crisis in Lebanon have effects on fuel supplies availability of food and availability of essential medicines including crossline and cross-border efforts. Finally resource mobilization constraints have hampered ongoing emergency health response activities and impacted the continuity of established interventions such as primary care networks routine immunization referrals and supply chains upon which vulnerable persons increasingly rely.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpbGZpbmdlci5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9kZXRhaWxzL2JpbGZpbmdlci1kZWxpdmVycy1tYWludGVuYW5jZS1zZXJ2aWNlcy1mb3ItZXZvbmlrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bilfinger delivers maintenance services for Evonik,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bilfinger.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/news/press-releases/details/bilfinger-delivers-maintenance-services-for-evonik/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C491C49840>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpbGZpbmdlci5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9kZXRhaWxzL2JpbGZpbmdlci1kZWxpdmVycy1tYWludGVuYW5jZS1zZXJ2aWNlcy1mb3ItZXZvbmlrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sdXh1cnl0cmF2ZWxtYWdhemluZS5jb20vbmV3cy1hcnRpY2xlcy9jYXlvLWxldmFudGFkby1yZXNvcnQtYS1wcml2YXRlLWlzbGFuZC1yZXNvcnQtdG8tb3Blbi1uLXRoZS1kb21pbmljYW4tcmVwdWJsaWPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cayo Levantado Resort A Private Island Resort to Open in the Dominican Republic - 85037,"Cayo Levantado Resort A Private Island Resort to Open in the Dominican Republic

Tens of thousands of Christians took to the streets across the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Sunday to protest violence in eastern regions as church leaders accused the international community of hypocrisy over Rwanda’s alleged role in the fighting.

After Sunday services churchgoers in the capital Kinshasa and other major cities heeded a call from the Conference of Catholic Bishops to demonstrate against the conflict with the M23 rebel group which Congo accuses Rwanda of supporting.

Rwanda denies this.

“We say no to war no to a divided Congo” said Blaise Emmanuel vicar at St Elizabeth’s parish who with other priests led a procession in Montgafula one of the poorest municipalities in Kinshasa.

The mass protests were the most significant since an escalation in fighting in recent months between state forces and M23. The violence has displaced an estimated 390000 people according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Demonstrators in Kinshasa sang and carried banners reading: “No to Balkanisation no to the hypocrisy of the international community. The DRC is not for sale.”

Many in Congo have for years accused the West of failing to hold Rwanda to account for its alleged role in stoking insecurity in the east.

The European Parliament in late November called on Rwanda not to support the M23 rebels. But last week the European Commission was criticised in Congo for a decision to give 20 million euros ($21m) to support Rwandan troops helping fight rebels in Mozambique.

At the end of the march in Montgafula protesters sang the national anthem and a priest holding a Congolese flag climbed onto a chair to address the crowd.

“It is the small country that is fighting us” said Father Theophile Landu in reference to Rwanda. “Behind it are the United States and the European Union. We tell them that they must stop the hypocrisy.”

In August US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said reports by UN experts that Rwanda continued to support the M23 were “credible”.

Rwanda’s government has disputed the findings.

Anti-Western sentiments were aired in other cities in protests where high-profile attendees included the head of the Senate several ministers and lawmakers from the ruling party and the opposition.

Congo and Rwanda took part in talks in late November aimed at finding solutions to the conflict. Other negotiations led by the seven-member East African Community (EAC) are ongoing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcm8ud2hvLmludC9jb3VudHJpZXMvdW5pdGVkLXJlcHVibGljLW9mLXRhbnphbmlhL25ld3MvemFuemliYXItc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LXJvbGxzLW91dC1maW5hbC1yb3VuZC1wb2xpby12YWNjaW5lc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zanzibar successfully rolls out final round of polio vaccines,"Zanzibar - In a bid to maximize protection of the population from outbreaks using scarce resources Zanzibar has successfully piggy backed measles and rubella vaccination and vitamin A drops administration on a scheduled fourth round of polio vaccination campaign.

Benefiting from a wide network of community health volunteers the three in one campaign reached its goals. A total of 363134 children above the targeted 361845 were vaccinated in 11 districts in all five regions of the Unguja and Pemba islands that make Zanzibar. A total of 2124 personnel including vaccinators recorders and community health volunteers were deployed and they reached 196216 houses.

The archipelago’s five regions and 26 of the Mainland comprise the United Republic of Tanzania.

Grateful for support from Rotary International and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation WHO provided doses of polio vaccine technical and logistical facilitation. UNICEF and other partners also supported the campaign.

During the four-day campaign and one additional day for mop up vaccination teams traversed the streets and rural suburbs to deliver the three protections: Measles Rubella vaccine injection and oral drops of polio vaccination and Vitamin A.

Taking advantage of the community engagement conducted for polio immunization campaign the results of the coverage of measles and rubella vaccination and Vitamin A drops matched the success of polio.

A total of 290571 children got measles and rubella vaccination which is 108% achievement from the estimated 269688. Vitamin A reached a total of 251171 children.

“We need to keep educating our public about the importance of vaccines in prevention of disease. As the community understanding about vaccination rises our country will grow healthier in general” said Honorable Othman Masoud the First Vice President of Zanzibar.

Speaking on behalf of the WHO Country Representative at the opening of the campaign Dr. William Mwengee said “On behalf of all partners involved in the campaign we reiterate our commitment to continue supporting Zanzibar’s effort to prevent polio and other vaccine preventable diseases.”

Measles broke out in Zanzibar in July this year causing nearly 2000 cases including 8 deaths according the Zanzibar Minister for health Honorable Ali Mazrui.

According to the Director of Preventive Services in MOH Zanzibar Dr. Salim Slim the integration of measles and rubella and vitamin A on polio immunization campaign saved time and costs for the health system.

The fourth round of polio immunization campaign is the final in a series of additional prevention to all children aged 0—59 months scheduled in Tanzania and other neighboring countries following outbreak of Wild poliovirus type 1 in Malawi and Mozambique. The two countries reported cases of wild polio in February and April this year."

‘As we get ready for Christmas we are encouraging islanders to reduce their waste in general’ said Tina Norman-Ross waste prevention and recycling officer.

‘The calendar will then hopefully be a reminder throughout next year to keep thinking about what ends up in the bin and highlight how a few small changes can save a lot of money.’

It is estimated more than £10m.-worth of food is thrown away in Guernsey each year.

More than 3000 tonnes are collected annually from households about two-thirds of which could have been eaten.

An average family could be wasting as much as £800 a year on food that is binned.

‘We asked our chefs to come up with a seasonal dish for a particular month using fresh local as well as general store cupboard ingredients’ said Mrs Norman-Ross.

‘We hope it will encourage people to plan ahead make shopping lists buy what they need and eat what they buy.’

The chefs supporting the initiative are from the Conservatory Cooked Copenhagen Imperial La Fregate La Reunion Le Pommier JB Parkers Pier 17 Old Government House and The Rockmount.

Richard Wood head chef at Le Pommier showed how islanders can use up food in the fridge and cupboard to make a delicious meal.

He made a vegetable moussaka in about 40 minutes which if made purchasing brand new ingredients would have been about £2.50 per person but was less due to using left over ingredients.

The campaign also highlights the differences between best before and use before dates.

Best before dates are found on products such as fruit and veg which can be eaten beyond the date whereas use before dates are more likely to be seen on certain meats which could cause harm if eaten after that date.

Mrs Norman-Ross said the run-up to Christmas was an important time to get the message across given the emphasis on food and drink over the festive season.

The $125 million terminal allows Royal Caribbean to bring in Oasis Class ships some of the biggest cruise ships in the world to Galveston. Architects Bermello Ajamil & Partners Inc. designed the 161300-square-foot LEED-certified building.

The new sculpture Galveston Beach Trio pays homage to the island’s musical heritage which includes Galveston-born Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter Barry White as well as musicians Joyce Fields who played piano for more than 18 years during Sunday brunch at the Hotel Galvez and Joe Pena a local guitarist known as the Granddaddy of Galveston Rock and Roll. As the sculpture features a human-sized pelican sea turtle and crab playing in a band the connection between these specific musicians and the sculpture may not be immediately clear to passersby but a nearby plaque provides details about Galveston’s rich music history.

In a press release announcing the new port and sculpture Joshua Carroll vice president Destination Development Royal Caribbean Group stated “Showcasing the history and culture of Galveston was our top priority in establishing this art installation in our new terminal and we’re thrilled to partner with Brad Oldham Sculpture to bring this vision to life.”

The Royal Caribbean Group worked with Houston-based Piper Faust Public Art to pull together a group of artists to consider for the opportunity. Ultimately the design by Mr. Oldham and Mrs. Coltrin was selected. The duo specializes in narrative-based sculpture and site-specific installations that capture the character and energy of a place.

Mr. Oldham remarked “We are honored to create a permanent installation that cultivates the vacation vibe with an approachable music theme using native animals to make up the band. It is exciting to think that the Galveston Beach Trio may make it into family vacation pictures to capture the special time together.”

Mrs. Coltrin added “Galveston is particularly meaningful to me because my grandfather was a 1925 graduate of Ball High School before attending Texas A&M University. He had a private architecture practice in Galveston in the 1940s. I think that he would like to know that his granddaughter helped create a sculpture celebrating his hometown.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYW1hbmRhbGEuY29tLmJ6L25ld3Mvcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLW1ha2VzLWRlYWwtd2l0aC1wb3J0LW9mLW1hZ2ljYWwtYmVsaXplL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean makes deal with Port of Magical Belize,"Photo: Port of Magical Belize

A letter from Royal Caribbean Group to David Gegg CEO of Portico Enterprises Ltd. indicates that the company has chosen to enter a business arrangement with the developers of Port of Magical Belize rather than the Stake Bank developers of Port Coral or Waterloo Holdings Ltd.

BELIZE CITY Thurs. Dec. 1 2022

According to a letter leaked to 7News by government sources the Royal Caribbean Group (RGC) has indicated its intention to enter a business arrangement with Portico Enterprises Ltd. the developer of Port of Magical Belize rather than the two other companies that have had plans to develop cruise terminals in the Belize District—Stake Bank Enterprises Ltd. and Waterloo Holdings Ltd.

That major cruise line has reportedly stated that the Port of Magical Belize project “encompasses the adequate environmental and operational criteria” required by the company and that a subsequent Memorandum of Understanding that will lay out the terms of partnership between the two entities is soon to be signed by the companies.

At this juncture as three companies (Portico Waterloo and Stake Bank) jostle for a spot in the cruise terminal sector within a limited geographical space in the Belize District (with indications from the Government of Belize that it might not be feasible to have three cruise terminals in the area) the selection of Port of Magical Belize by the Royal Caribbean Group could be crucial perhaps even decisive in determining which cruise terminal projects can succeed. Recently reports surfaced of the National Environmental Appraisal Committee’s denial of Waterloo’s proposal for the development of a cruise port at the Port of Belize Limited compound for a second time. While there is no indication at this time whether the company will continue to pursue approval of its project the Royal Caribbean Group has stated in their letter that their ships would not be docking at any Waterloo cruise terminal nor at Stake Bank’s Port Coral development the construction of which is already at an advanced stage.

“RCG commits that Magical Belize will be the exclusive development project and port of entry for RCG amongst Waterloo and Port Coral” the letter states.

That company whose passengers are currently tendered to the Fort Street Tourism Village (49% of which is owned by RCG) states that it will continue to honor its fiduciary responsibility to the FSTV until the concession is no longer valid or the tourism village is no longer a port of entry. At that point its ships would start berthing at the Port of Magical Belize which is to be located near Northern Lagoon in the southern part of the Belize District and is to be built at a cost of USD 355 million.

Royal Caribbean and the other major cruise lines have indicated the need for cruise destinations to provide shoreside berthing capabilities for its large Oasis-class vessels in line with an upgrade within the cruise industry. Those massive ships cannot berth at the Fort Street Tourism Village. The process of tendering passengers from sea to the mainland is to be phased out totally by 2025 which is the year in which the construction of Port of Magical Belize is reportedly scheduled to reach completion.

RCG has stated that they will now manage the project development along with the principals of Portico. The project will according to its developers create around 5000 jobs.

7News is claiming that the Port of Magical Belize’s “lead developer David Gegg has navigated between two governments first getting an MOU from the UDP in 2017 and then an EIA approved under the PUP in 2021… the project also got a ‘Definitive Agreement’ under the UDP signed one month before the election in October of 2020.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2JhYnktdW5leHBlY3RlZGx5LWJvcm4tb24tcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLzg5NTM40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baby Unexpectedly Born on Royal Caribbean Cruise Ship,"Royal Caribbean International’s Jewel of the Seas added an unexpected passenger after an expectant mother went into premature labor and gave birth on board on Tuesday November 29 2022. The mother and baby were transferred off the ship to medical facilities as soon as possible and both are doing well.

Baby on Board

The Radiance-class Jewel of the Seas is currently sailing a 6-night roundtrip Western Caribbean sailing from Port Canaveral Florida. The ship departed on Sunday November 27.

While on board as the ship was en route to Jamaica the expectant mother – whose name has not been released to protect the privacy of her and her family – was experiencing discomfort and as a precaution due to her pregnancy visited the ship’s medical facility.

The onboard medical team determined that she was in active labor the stage at which contractions intensify and such discomfort would no longer be able to be walked off or dismissed as general cramps.

The premature baby was safely delivered onboard the cruise ship by Dr. Alif Patilla a senior physician for Royal Caribbean International with virtual assistance from Dr. Jorge Perez a neonatal specialist with KIDZ Medical Services a partner of Royal Caribbean.

“The people of Royal Caribbean – shoreside and crew – are truly best in class. This week it was proven again with the incredible delivery of this baby at sea” said Dr. Calvin Johnson M.D. Chief Medical Officer Royal Caribbean Group.

When Jewel of the Seas arrived in Ocho Rios the baby and mother were transferred to St. Ann’s Bay Regional Hospital which is just 7 miles (11 kilometers) from the cruise ship dock. The baby was admitted to the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit.

Both mother and baby are reported as doing well and are to be transferred to Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami on Friday December 2. There have been no reported delays or changes to Jewel of the Seas‘ itinerary and the ship is scheduled to return to Port Canaveral on Saturday December 3.

Pregnancy Policies

All cruise lines have strict policies about setting sail when pregnant. For Royal Caribbean International all boarding guests must fill out a health questionnaire prior to embarkation that confirms they are not more than 23 weeks pregnant and if pregnant will not reach the 23-week mark before the cruise ends.

If a mother is uncertain as to the date of conception or the last day of her most recent menstrual cycle it can be difficult to know precisely how many weeks along a pregnancy may be.

A normal pregnancy length is 40 weeks but premature babies may be born many weeks before that timeline. A premature baby is generally considered to be one that is born before reaching 37 weeks. Roughly 10% of babies born in the United States are premature.

Cruise lines refuse service to women later in pregnancy due to the risk of complications when the ship may be far from more extensive medical facilities that can provide specialized infant emergency care if necessary.

While cruise ships are equipped with a full medical team for general emergencies the specialist care necessary for infants particularly if born premature means it is better to have shoreside facilities available. There is no indication at all that the new mother took any unnecessary risks or violated Royal Caribbean’s pregnancy rule.

While rare unexpected births do happen occasionally on cruise ships. In 2015 a baby boy was born aboard Royal Caribbean’s Independence of the Seas and in 2016 a baby boy was born aboard Cunard Line’s Queen Mary 2.

Many experienced travelers may plan a cruise a year or more before setting sail. If a booked guest finds themselves unable to sail because of pregnancy Royal Caribbean International has Resolution Agents that will help make further plans to accommodate the pregnancy.

Possible options depending on the timing of the cruise might include moving the sailing to an earlier date postponing the trip until after the expected birth or refunding the cruise altogether. Each case is considered individually on its unique circumstances.

MIAMI FL — A passenger on a Royal Caribbean cruise unexpectedly gave birth at sea with the help of the ship’s medical team and a neonatal specialist on shore in Miami.

The mother didn’t feel well while traveling on the Jewel of the Seas and visited the medical facility on Tuesday Royal Caribbean said. The ship’s doctors quickly realized that she was in active labor. The premature baby weighing 2.2 pounds was delivered on board by Royal Caribbean’s senior physician Dr. Alif Patilla and his medical crew and the virtual assistance of Dr. Jorge Perez founder of KIDZ Medical Services a partner of the cruise line. Perez was on the phone with the ship all night from 6 p.m. to 4 a.m. according to a news release from his office.

“My initial concerns were about the capability of the medical team on the ship and their resources since this was an extremely unusual situation and a 22-week-old infant is just at the edge of viability” Perez told Patch. Cruise ships aren’t equipped to handle this type of birth he said. “After they were able to successfully intubate the child I was more comfortable.”

Perez guided the on-board medical team as they improvised with an adult ventilator on the premie. He also walked them through administering fluids through a peripheral IV monitoring the child’s glucose and drawing up a sugar solution and antibiotics to the correct dosage for the baby. He also taught them to regulate the baby’s temperature using saran wrap.

“The shipboard doctor on the Royal Caribbean International ship did everything I told him to do” Perez said. “Without his excellent collaboration and constant communication the outcome would likely have been quite different. For instance not every physician is able to intubate a preemie and the shipboard doctor — using a laryngoscope most likely for an adult-sized person — followed my instructions in great detail. Together this team of clinicians and dedicated professionals saved this baby's life.” The mother and baby were transferred to St. Ann’s Bay Hospital when the ship arrived at its next port Ocho Rios Jamaica Royal Caribbean said. The child was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.

The family was later transferred to Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami. “The people of Royal Caribbean — shoreside and crew — are truly best in class. This week it was proven again with the incredible delivery of this baby at sea” Dr. Calvin Johnson M.D. chief medical officer Royal Caribbean Group said in a statement provided."

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

The finding of 'reasonable' evidence to conclude that the U.S. ally had breached international law in its conduct of the war in Gaza was released in a summary of a report being delivered to Congress on Friday.

It is the strongest statement that the Biden administration has made yet.

But the caveat that the U.S. was unable immediately to link specific U.S. weapons to individual strikes by Israeli forces in Gaza could give the administration leeway in any future decision on whether to restrict provisions of offensive weapons to Israel.

The first-of-its-kind assessment which was compelled by President Joe Biden´s fellow Democrats in Congress comes after seven months of airstrikes ground fighting and aid restrictions that have claimed the lives of nearly 35000 Palestinians mostly women and children.

Those were launched in response to Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 2023 that saw 1300 Israelis murdered.

While U.S. officials were unable to gather all the information they needed on specific strikes the report said given Israel's 'significant reliance' on U.S.-made weapons it was 'reasonable to assess' that they had been used by Israel's security forces in instances 'inconsistent' with its obligations under international humanitarian law 'or with best practices for mitigating civilian harm.'

Israel's military has the experience technology and know-how to minimize harm to civilians but 'the results on the ground including high levels of civilian casualties raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases' the report said.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen the Maryland Democrat who led the push in Congress told reporters that even even though the administration had reached a general finding 'they´re ducking a determination on the hard cases politically inconvenient cases.'

Biden has tried to walk an ever-finer line in his support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu´s war against Hamas.

He has faced growing rancor at home and abroad over the soaring Palestinian death toll and the onset of famine caused in large part by Israeli restrictions on the movement of food and aid into Gaza.

Tensions have been heightened further in recent weeks by Netanyahu´s pledge to expand the Israeli military´s offensive in the crowded southern city of Rafah despite Biden's adamant opposition.

Biden is in the closing months of a tough reelection campaign against Donald Trump. He faces demands from many Democrats that he cut the flow of offensive weapons to Israel and denunciation from Republicans who accuse him of wavering on support for Israel at its time of need.

Rep. Michael McCaul the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said the review was unnecessary 'and only contributes to politically motivated anti-Israel sentiment.'

'Now is the time to stand with our ally Israel and ensure they have the tools they need' he said in a statement.

The Democratic administration took one of the first steps toward conditioning military aid to Israel in recent days when it paused a shipment of 3500 bombs out of concern over Israel´s threatened offensive on Rafah a southern city crowded with more than a million Palestinians a senior administration official said.

The presidential directive agreed to in February obligated the Defense and State departments to conduct 'an assessment of any credible reports or allegations that such defense articles and as appropriate defense services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law including international humanitarian law.'

Nothing in the presidential directive would have triggered any cutoff of arms if the administration had more definitively ruled that Israel´s conduct had violated international law.

The agreement also obligated them to tell Congress whether they deemed that Israel has acted to 'arbitrarily to deny restrict or otherwise impede directly or indirectly' delivery of any U.S.-supported humanitarian aid into Gaza for starving civilians there.

On this question the report cited 'deep concerns' that Israel played a significant role in preventing adequate aid from reaching starving Palestinians. However it said Israel had recently taken some positive steps although still inadequate and the U.S. government did not currently find Israel restricting aid deliveries in a way that violated U.S. law governing foreign militaries that receive U.S. military aid.

Van Hollen accused the administration of glossing over what he said were clear Israeli blocks on food and aid deliveries during much of the war. 'That´s why we have hundreds of thousands of Palestinians that have nothing to do with Hamas on the verge of starvation' he said.

Lawmakers and others who advocated for the review said Biden and previous American leaders have followed a double standard when enforcing U.S. laws governing how foreign militaries use U.S. support an accusation the Biden administration denies. They had urged the administration to make a straightforward legal determination of whether there was credible evidence that specific Israeli airstrikes on schools crowded neighborhoods medical workers aid convoys and other targets and restrictions on aid shipments into Gaza violated the laws of war and human rights.

Their opponents argued that a U.S. finding against Israel would weaken it at a time it is battling Hamas and other Iran-backed groups. Any sharply critical findings on Israel are sure to add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel´s military and further heighten tensions with Netanyahu´s hard-right government over its conduct of the war against Hamas.

Any finding against Israel also could endanger Biden´s support in this year's presidential elections from some voters who keenly support Israel.

At the time the White House agreed to the review it was working to head off moves from Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to start restricting shipments of weapons to Israel.

Israel launched its offensive after an Oct. 7 assault into Israel led by Hamas killed about 1200 people. Two-thirds of the Palestinians killed since then have been women and children according to local health officials. U.S. and U.N. officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct. 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.

Human rights groups long have accused Israeli security forces of committing abuses against Palestinians and have accused Israeli leaders of failing to hold those responsible to account. In January in a case brought by South Africa the top U.N. court ordered Israel to do all it could to prevent death destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

Israel says it is following all U.S. and international law that it investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces and that its campaign in Gaza is proportional to the existential threat it says is posed by Hamas.

Biden in December said 'indiscriminate bombing' was costing Israel international backing. After Israeli forces targeted and killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen in April the Biden administration for the first time signaled it might cut military aid to Israel if it didn´t change its handling of the war and humanitarian aid.

Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 1980s and early 1990s were the last presidents to openly hold back weapons or military financing to try to push Israel to change its actions in the region or toward Palestinians.

A report to the Biden administration by an unofficial self-formed panel including military experts academics and former State Department officials detailed Israeli strikes on aid convoys journalists hospitals schools and refugee centers and other sites. They argued that the civilian death toll in those strikes - such as an Oct. 31 strike on an apartment building reported to have killed 106 civilians - was disproportionate to the blow against any military target."

Chris Hill: Another co-CEO bites the dust and we've got a bull-vs.-bear debate on cloud infrastructure. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me Motley Fool senior analyst Emily Flippen. Thanks for being here.

Emily Flippen: Thanks for having me Chris.

Hill: It was one year ago today on our MarketFoolery podcast that the lead story was Salesforce. The company's third-quarter results were really good and they were overshadowed by the news that CEO Marc Benioff was being joined by Bret Taylor as co-CEO. Here we are one year later and once again Salesforce's third-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected and this is getting overshadowed again Emily by the news that Taylor is leaving the company. We will get to the results in a minute but I'm struck by the fact that for the second time in less than three years a co-CEO is leaving Marc Benioff and Salesforce.

Flippen: Benioff sounded sad about it in his commentary. It makes me wonder if it was never quite a great relationship to begin with but you certainly do feel bad for Marc Benioff now re-entering the role of sole as CEO. He is the co-founder of Salesforce so he has been there since the beginning for this company. But Bret Taylor was an operational CEO if you will to match Benioff's visionary tendencies. Certainly the market did not appreciate this departure not only because the tenure was so short but also because it raised the questions of well what's going on behind the scenes in these relationships? Is Salesforce losing some of the operational capacity that they had with Taylor? It's a big question mark for Salesforce right now but we do know that Benioff is a strong leader. The results from Salesforce were strong as well. Within its own I don't think it changes the investment thesis for investors in this company but it certainly raises some yellow flags.

Hill: We were talking before we started recording. You pointed out that there's not a huge dataset in terms of public company co-CEOs but the dataset that we do have as small as it is it's not great. It's just like I don't know. I'm now between this the co-CEO -- maybe ""debacle"" is too strong a word but the co-CEOs that didn't work out at Chipotle. We could name other companies as well. I don't know. You just used the phrase ""yellow flag."" It's now moved into that category for me as an investor. If I see a company in my portfolio is coming out with the news that the CEO is being joined by a co-CEO I'm now no longer looking at it as glass half full.

Flippen: It's such a fun dynamic to try to bait because you don't really know what's going on behind the scenes with co-CEOs. So it's really easy to point out well this is a structure that's never going to work in the first place because what you're doing is we're moving the single point of responsibility that exists for an organization. When you're the CEO of a company even if you're not making decisions that affect the company itself you are the responsible party for that company's performance. At any time you're dividing up responsibility among two people it can turn into a battle of well that wasn't my call; that was the co-CEO's call. You are then potentially exposing yourself to more in-fighting. Now there are some good examples of companies that have made this work. Atlassian and their two co-CEOs/two co-founders have done an incredible job of leading that company to a long track record of success.

But I do think to your point we don't have enough data. There is such a small subset of companies that have ever operated under the regime of two co-CEOs to really draw out whether or not it means good things or bad things for companies. But because we have seen so many high profile blow-ups I think it's fair to say it is a yellow flag. Whenever I see the structure coming into play what I want to see is some conversation around how they're going to divide up those responsibilities. Where do they see their circle of competencies? What decisions are they making? What conflict resolution policies do they have when those decisions come into conflict with each other? All of these things happen behind the scenes which can make it so challenging for an individual investor who doesn't have insight into how these decisions are being made to figure out is this a bad structure or is this potentially a good structure?

Hill: Shares of Salesforce are down 10% today. As you said this was a really solid quarter. Are we seeing a little bit of headline risk here that whatever drama there is surrounding the co-CEO leaving is masking what on the surface appears to be really good results?

Flippen: I will say I think this is a bit of an overreaction and I think the market's overlooking what aspect of Bret Taylor's career that is potentially also coming into play here. Taylor used to be on the board of directors for Twitter. But with the Musk transition that board has been resolved. This could be a situation. Dissolved not resolved. Hopefully to be resolved at some point in the future but dissolved for the time being which has put Taylor in a position where maybe his career is just coming to a crossroads. He has an entrepreneurial pass like you mentioned. He spent a long time working for large organizations Salesforce Facebook even leading them through their IPO as CTO. There are ways for him to potentially evolve his career. That could simply have nothing to do with the performance of Salesforce or co-leading with Marc Benioff and much more to do with his individual career.

Hill: Let's move to groceries. Kroger's third-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. The grocery chain also raised guidance for the full fiscal year. Kroger is the parent company of a number of grocery brands including Ralphs and Harris Teeter. I don't think this should surprise anyone who's actually been to a grocery store lately just the fact that a grocery store chain is doing well in these inflationary times.

Flippen: We're all feeling it in our pocketbooks. Anytime for me my weekly grocery shops have dramatically increased in price. My instinct when I see Kroger and other grocery stores doing well as a consumer is to be a little bit put out. It's great that you're doing well but what about my pocketbook? But there have been a lot of eyes on Kroger given its earlier announcement this year of their intention to acquire Albertsons combining two of the largest grocery store chains in the U.S. They think that will lower prices for consumers. There's some regulatory questions about whether or not that would actually be anticompetitive. But regardless there are a lot of eyes looking on Kroger as a result of this acquisition and they certainly met expectations in the quarter. Revenue rose more than 6% year over year. That's excluding fuel.

Their gross margins actually held steady which is extremely impressive for a grocery store chain to achieve during these inflationary periods. Their same-store sales or their comparable-store sales rose nearly 7%. As a result they raised guidance across the board including and most importantly for their store brands. I think this is where the story gets a little bit more nuanced than just saying well people are buying more groceries inflation is hard corporate greed is up. Kroger has actually put a lot of effort into developing and expanding their private-label brands. Those private labels themselves saw same-store sales growth of nearly 10%. That's just the I should say same-store sales probably a bad comparable.

But comparable growth for those brands of 10% in the quarter which is extremely impressive for a company of their size and their operating profits have actually declined minorly in part because of some of this accounting funkiness with the impact that inflation has on their inventory accounting systems. But also in part thanks to increases of expensive operation. It's not like Kroger is doing so exceptionally well in these inflationary times that they are taking a victory lap. This is still a very low-margin business. They're trying to squeeze out the margin that they can to provide value for customers by launching and pushing their private-label products which sell at lower prices in comparison to higher-value brands. This is a good business but one that is still attempting to navigate an uncertain economy the same way we are as consumers.

Hill: It is a low-margin business which is why the stat you just shared about their in-house brands and the comparable growth there is as impressive as it is. This is a business that has historically done a good job with its acquisitions with incorporating the brands that they acquire and bringing them under the Kroger umbrella. They've never attempted it with a grocery chain the size of Albertsons. How much of a challenge is that for them? I'm assuming part of the navigation they have to do is prepare for the Albertsons acquisition while also making it clear to regulators that they're doing their due diligence and that they are laying out a good case for why this acquisition should go through. Because I could see competitors making the case to regulators you shouldn't let something the size of Kroger acquire something the size of Albertsons.

Flippen: It's a fair argument to be made which does put the onus on Kroger to prove that they can lower prices as a result. Their argument is hey we're up against unprecedented competition right now. Walmart even Amazon all these e-commerce players getting into grocery and this combination will allow us to be more efficient scale larger and provide lower prices for consumers. That's their argument to regulators. But to your point Chris getting them to buy that argument challenging especially in an environment that has a lot of scrutiny from regulators but also it's probably going to be very expensive for Kroger. We've already seen some of these costs start to weigh on the business. I wouldn't be surprised to see their bottom line contract as this integration and this acquisition is swallowed by Kroger. Expect for the nonadjusted bottom line to be impacted if this acquisition does continue to move forward. But long term I do think this combination if it's allowed by regulators and if it's achieved appropriately could be wonderful in terms of just expanding Kroger's reach and hopefully improving its margin.

Hill: Emily Flippen always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.

Flippen: Thanks for having me again Chris.

Hill: Before this next segment I got to give you a heads-up on something we're going to be doing all month. If you listened to our MarketFoolery podcast back in the day you know that the man behind the glass Dan Boyd and I have a tradition in the month of December. Back in 2015 we were complaining to each other about the lack of creativity that radio stations have when they switch their format to playing all holiday music. To be clear it's not that we're anti-holiday music. We are fans of holiday music. What bothers us is that radio stations play the same 50 songs over and over. No disrespect to Mariah Carey; love that song. ""Jingle Bell Rock""? Sure. Play that once for old time's sake. But over and over? This was something that Dan and I could not abide.

So we decided to do our small part to broaden everyone's horizon of holiday music. This month Monday through Thursday from now until Christmas we're replacing our usual outro music with something that you are not going to hear on your local radio station. If you're wondering what the song is just check the show notes on your podcast app.

Now on to the next segment. Running a business means dealing with competitors and it's tough to compete with a company that is roughly 1000 times bigger than yours. But that's exactly what DigitalOcean is trying to do in the business of cloud infrastructure. With more here's Ricky Mulvey.

Ricky Mulvey: Welcome to bear-vs.-bull. We pick a company find some analysts and then flip a coin to see which side they'll take. Today the company is DigitalOcean a cloud infrastructure provider for small to medium-sized businesses. On the bull side making his bull-vs.-bear debut -- it's not bear-vs.-bull; it's definitely bull-vs.-bear -- making his bull-vs.-bear debut it is Jeff Santoro. Welcome.

Jeff Santoro: Hey Ricky. How are you doing? Happy to be here.

Mulvey: Doing well. Thanks for being here. And on the bear side returning champion Jamie Louko. Thanks for playing.

Jamie Louko: I hate to put a stifle on Jeff's debut but it's going to be a tough panel today.

Santoro: Yeah we'll see.

Mulvey: Oh there's no easy outs in bull-vs.-bear. Let's get started. Jeff Santoro five minutes for the bull side. Time is yours.

Santoro: All right. Let's say you're a small or medium-sized business or maybe even a start-up. You have as little as two employees maybe a few dozen. It's 2022. You absolutely need cloud infrastructure to compete. There's no way around it. So you have several choices. You can go to the cloud behemoths like AWS Google Cloud Microsoft Azure and you know what you're going to get. It's going to be a quality product. But the question is at what cost? You will literally be a tiny fish in a massive pond. The pricing is going to be opaque customer support might be difficult to navigate and the offerings are super complicated especially for a small business that doesn't have a team of software developers and engineers to navigate that scenario. Enter DigitalOcean. They offer transparent affordable pricing. It's easy to understand. There's 24/7 customer support no matter how big or small your business is.

There's a community of developers ready to add extra support. It's the ideal choice for start-ups and small or medium-sized businesses that have a limited staff and limited financial resources. This is the market that DigitalOcean caters to and it's done so very successfully. It's also a big market opportunity. By one estimate DigitalOcean has a total addressable market of $72 billion and that's projected to double by 2025 to $145 billion. Just to put that in perspective DigitalOcean's trailing 12-month revenue as of this past quarter was only $533 million. Even if that TAM number is wildly optimistic the market opportunity is still huge for DigitalOcean. Now what happens when these small businesses become large businesses? Well DigitalOcean is going to need to adapt and grow with its customers so it can continue to support them.

But the evidence so far is that their customers are really happy with the platform and that should really help with churn and keep customers as the company scales. To drive this point home in the last quarter DigitalOcean's net dollar retention rate was 118%. That means that customers now are spending 18% more than they did a year ago. Importantly this number includes churn so that's customers that have left. This number was also 107% when the company first came on the public markets back in Q1 of 2021. It's grown pretty strong over the time that they've been publicly traded. What's even more impressive about that churn number and about the net dollar retention rate is that a lot of small businesses go out of business. Some of that churn isn't companies leaving because they're not happy with DigitalOcean; it's because they simply went out of business. So that makes the churn number and the retention rate number even more impressive.

Let's take a look at DigitalOcean's most recent quarter which was Q3 of 2022 reported recently. I want to compare a couple of important metrics to that first publicly reported quarter Q1 of '21. Year over year revenue growth has never been below 29%. Gross margin has expanded from 58% to 65%. On the bottom line the company has gone from a net loss of $3 million in that first reported quarter to net income of $10 million in most recent quarter. Free cash flow has been positive in every quarter except the first one when they were on the public market.

Lastly one thing that I like to look at when I evaluate businesses is their operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. In Q3 of 2022 their operating expenses were 58% of revenue and in the year-ago quarter that number was 62%. We've seen that improve over the past couple of months. Now what about moving forward? Well Q4 management is expecting $161 million of revenue at the midpoint.

That would be a year-over-year increase of 34% and would continue that revenue growth streak that I mentioned earlier. For the full year revenue target is $574 million at the midpoint and that's actually raised from where the guidance was in Q2. It would mean full-year revenue growth of 32% compared to 2021. Lastly free cash flow margin was 15% and management is expecting that to grow to 20% by 2024.

The last thing I want to talk about is valuation. Despite all these strong results DigitalOcean trades for around 5.5 times trailing sales and 70 times free cash flow and both of those metrics are just about at their all-time low. You can buy shares of DigitalOcean right now for almost as cheap as it's ever been.

Just to sum it up DigitalOcean has carved this niche within a market opportunity that has massive secular tailwinds. If it continues to please its customers and can grow with them while continuing to take share of the growing SMB market this will be a winning investment for years to come.

Mulvey: Jeff Santoro thank you for the bull case. Yeah competing with Microsoft Amazon Google that sounds difficult. Taking the bear side Jamie Louko five minutes is yours.

Louko: Thanks Ricky. As much as I love DigitalOcean I have a few problems with the company. The first is that it's facing some huge competitors. DigitalOcean is up against rivals like Amazon Web Services Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure in this space. While DigitalOcean is the only platform that has major SMB offerings this could definitely change. Amazon has about $35 billion in cash. Microsoft has $63 billion in cash and is generating $23 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. Google is generating $22 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow and has about $62.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Comparatively DigitalOcean has just $825 million in cash and marketable securities and about $41 million in trailing 12-month free cash flow. While Amazon Microsoft and Google don't have leading SMB cloud solutions yet that could change and all three companies have more than enough money to build market-leading products if DigitalOcean continues to gain steam and these companies want a piece of that pie.

But why haven't these large rivals done it yet? Potentially these three big players don't have established solutions because there hasn't been consistent demand for it yet. Now that Amazon Google and Microsoft see that there is established demand for these SMB cloud solutions these three competitors could just funnel money into this niche offering quite easily. DigitalOcean came in and picked this low-hanging fruit at the beginning but they basically had no competition thus far. As rivals pick up the pace in this niche offering the company's growth could slow. The company isn't seeing this yet as DigitalOcean is expecting about 34% 2022 revenue growth but that's because these rivals haven't started investing in this SMB space yet. That is my first risk. The other risks with DigitalOcean is its balance sheet.

Typically cloud companies have a strong balance sheet with little debt and lots of cash but that's not the case with DigitalOcean. They have cash and marketable securities of about $825 million but long-term debt of $1.5 billion. This brings up two main concerns. The first is that this large debt pile potentially indicates that DigitalOcean has been fueling its growth with debt. Once the company can't take on any more debt growth could slow dramatically. The second is that in an environment with high interest rates the company can afford to take on additional debt to continue to fuel this top line growth. With this lopsided balance sheet the company will be forced to pay off this debt instead of using its cash to invest to keep its leadership role in this space. That's already going to be hard to do considering that rivals are likely going to come into this space in the future but this factor makes it especially hard.

DigitalOcean has been a success story so far. There's no doubt about that. But the company's future looks a lot more uncertain than it ever has. With rivals putting lots of money and potentially out-investing DigitalOcean in this space over the coming years the company has previously been operating in a market with relatively low competition and it's likely been relying on debt to fuel this growth. All of these factors could be major headwinds to the company's adoption and market share growth over the next five years. Therefore I'm not expecting the same success over the past five years for the next five for DigitalOcean and prospective investors shouldn't either. This could make it hard for DigitalOcean to live up to its valuation of 72 times free cash flow. Yes while that might be an all-time low it's still exorbitant for a company with this many headwinds on the horizon. With rising competition an upside-down balance sheet and a valuation that could potentially be really hard to live up to over the next five years DigitalOcean is in a really uncertain spot and I'm pretty concerned about the company's long-term future.

Mulvey: Yeah they might need to buy some servers. Jamie Louko thank you for the bear case. Jeff Santoro thank you for the bull side. Hey Motley Fool Money listener you can decide who made the better argument at @MotleyFoolMoney on Twitter.

Standing at 180 metres the 50-storey site will comprise 24 levels of commercial office space acquired earlier in 2022 by LaSalle Investment Management and a 252-suite 4-star hotel snapped up by Singaporean-based Ascott Limited in 2019.

This compares to the Salesforce tower developed by Lendlease at Circular Quay which stands at 55-storeys or 263 metres making it the tallest office tower in Sydney. The project also includes the former North Sydney Fire Station now called the Firehouse Hotel.

Here is our review of the new Seagate FireCuda Han Solo External Hard Drive.

Get your hands on the ultimate collectible — the officially licensed Han Solo Drive. Designed with the confidence of the infamous smuggler and pilot this Special Edition FireCuda External Hard Drive flies into your system with white LED lighting out of the box. Plus you can gather a bounty of games files and media thanks to its massive capacity.

What’s in the box?

The box contains the Han Solo FireCuda hard drive USB cable quick start guide and some cool stickers.

A Closer Look

Setting Up the Drive

When you first connect the drive to your computer you can click on either a Windows app or a Mac app. In my case I clicked on the Mac app and it brought up the registration box and also a link to download Toolkit (which you will need if you want to change the colours on the drive or set up file protection).

Once Toolkit was installed I could see the drive and also a notification that I needed to perform some updates in order to use the RGB features – so all I had to do was click a button and then reboot my Mac.

Once the reboot was completed it was just a case of clicking the plus sign in the RGB option to go into that feature. From there you can change the intensity of the illumination or turn it off all together. You can also set up your own colour options including rainbow options if you so wish. It’s all really quick and easy to do.

The other option in Toolkit is called Mirror. Basically this enables you to set up a 2-way sync folder between the user folder (or any other folder you select) and the drive. Anything added or removed from those folders will automatically be mirrored to the other. This saves you having to do it all manually – which saves a bit of time and hassle and ensures whatever folder you select to mirror will always be backed up.

Final Thoughts

External hard drives are always useful whether for backing up your files storing games and saves or anything else really. Why not have a drive that looks good and not just performs well.

That’s where the Seagate FireCuda Han Solo Hard Drive comes into play. The drive itself is black and has an embossed image of Han himself on it along with an LED strip that lights up when in use.

The drive itself is very lightweight and can easily be carried in a pocket or a bag if you need to take it places with you.

The drive also comes with a two year warranty and three years of Seagate Rescue Data Recovery which enables you to have Seagate attempt a data recovery on your behalf if something happens to the drive. This is a really great addition to the drive and one of those things you hope you never have to use but you’ll be glad you had the option if the worst happens.

I found the drive to be easy to use looks great and have great features including the mirror option for my really important files. The 2TB’s quickly got filed up – but that’s a good excuse to get the other Star Wars drives too!

Add the Han Solo drive to your setup today – you won’t be disappointed.

The Seagate FireCuda Han Solo Hard Drive is available now priced around £124.99. There are also a number of other Star Wars versions too! All three drives are 2TB and are compatible with both Windows and Mac.

Painting your living room is a great way to make a major impact in your space but is that change something you'll embrace for years to come? As we all know trends come and go and even our home's interiors aren't immune to the cycle. Of course interior design is subjective but it's important to consider if that swatch is something you really love or just something you've seen all over your Pinterest feed.

Like any other decorative element of design colors move through the five stages of the trend cycle — introduction increase peak decline and obsolescence (via Masterclass). This may be a fun wave to ride with more temporary items like clothes and décor but when it comes to major switches in your home like painting your living room it's often best to stick with the classics instead. That's why we're here to share the paint color fads that you might be better off avoiding — even if they seem like a good idea in the moment.",,,,,,,,,

While the sights and sounds fill some with holiday cheer those same sensations can be bothersome for others especially young people with special needs.

That's why Simon Property Group designates a few hours for families with children who have special needs to meet Santa in a calmer setting.

""Santa's been doing a nice job with the kids kind of adjusting. If you want to hug Santa you can hug Santa; if you don't even want to sit near Santa that's okay too"" said Christian Carlson the Simon Mall Area Director of Marketing and Business Development.



At regular times the process to meet Santa can be a lot for some families.

""I still remember what it was like trying to come before this and that was very stressful. Waiting in line and all the sensations were very overwhelming"" said Jim Gillen a South Bend resident who brought his family to meet Santa.



At Caring Santa Santa's scene is set and the mall takes in families one by one before the mall opens to the public.

That way there's no music no loud noises and most importantly no line.

""Everything takes a little bit longer when you have a wheelchair and it sometimes can be a little stress and sometimes can be overwhelming"" said Gillen. ""This is a much slower pace. A less stressful nice enjoyable experience.""

And without a line the kids can get down to what's important.

""Just some Nintendo Wii shop cards Lego Mario set an Apple Watch..."" Evan Swihart listed off his Christmas list ""and a bunch of other stuff.""



This event plans to continue so all kids can be comfortable celebrating the holiday season for years to come.



""He's great with our son you can see obviously how wonderful Santa is with the other children. And it also ends up being our yearly family photo"" laughed Gillen ""we all get to sit there with Santa and get a nice picture.""



If you missed the chance to be a part of Caring Santa this year the mall recommends coming in earlier in the week especially earlier in the day for a calmer environment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGV0aW1lcy5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlL3NlYW4tcXVpbm5zLWZvcm1lci1wcm9wZXJ0eS1lbXBpcmUtdG9kYXktZml2ZS1zdGFyLXNsaWV2ZS1ydXNzZWxsLWhvdGVsLWV4cGVjdGVkLXRvLWZldGNoLW92ZXItMjBtLW12OTd0Zm5tYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seán Quinn's former property empire today — five-star Slieve Russell hotel expected to fetch over €20m,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGV0aW1lcy5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlL3NlYW4tcXVpbm5zLWZvcm1lci1wcm9wZXJ0eS1lbXBpcmUtdG9kYXktZml2ZS1zdGFyLXNsaWV2ZS1ydXNzZWxsLWhvdGVsLWV4cGVjdGVkLXRvLWZldGNoLW92ZXItMjBtLW12OTd0Zm5tYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C4914EC6A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Backed into $2.90 favouritism Amelia’s Jewel became the fourth filly to win the weight-for-age feature courtesy of an outstanding ride by jockey Patrick Carbery.

The Siyouni filly settled fifth from barrier one and Carbery got her off the inside rail at the 1200m in what proved to be a crucial move.

After being momentarily held-up for clear running at the top of the straight Amelia’s Jewel burst through a gap between rivals and pounced on Ironclad at the 75m to hit the front.

She won by a length from Ironclad ($61) who improved on his disappointing Railway Stakes run with a strong on-speed performance.

Steinem ($12) added a valuable Group 1 placing to her VC when running third for Melbourne Cup-winning trainers Ciaron Maher and David Eustace.

Godolphin star Cascadian displaced by Amelia’s Jewel for favouritism when starting at $3.20 made up a stack of late ground to run fourth but ultimately had too much work to do from near last.

Miller a five-time Group 1 placegetter before the Northerly triumph didn’t feel the pressure of preparing Amelia’s Jewel for the rich race.

“I’ve been peppering away and at some stage it was always going to happen” Miller said of his first Group 1 win.

“To be honest it doesn’t worry me if I didn’t (win one).

“I just love winning whether it be here or a Northam maiden. I’m a competitive bastard and I love winning.

I’m a competitive bastard and I love winning.

“Isn’t she a good filly? She’s just a freak. She’s got an unbelievable engine with a huge stride and a great brain.”

Miller moved to Perth in 2008 to train under the Aquanita Racing banner after gaining valuable experience from top trainers such as John O’Shea and Robbie Griffiths on the east coast.

Unbeaten from three starts as a two-year-old Amelia’s Jewel headed into the Northerly on the back of a superb win in the Group 2 WA Guineas (1600m).

“It was 44 years since someone’s one a Karrakatta and a Guineas and she ticked that one off” Miller said.

“Her gallop Tuesday was superb and it was what she did leading into the Guineas and she won so I knew we had her on track.”

Peter Walsh of Amelia Park Racing and Breeding said Amelia’s Jewel’s win was his crowning moment in about five decades in racing.

Walsh bought broodmare Bumbasina from a Tattersall’s sale in England and had her served by top French sire Siyouni after a trip to Europe.

“I’ve waited 50 years for that but it’s worth it” Walsh said.

“It’s a bit surreal. I feel like I’ve died and gone to heaven.

“We think she’s a superstar we love her and she’s brought so much joy to us.

“I’ve got to give credit to my wife Annie who was behind all this. She said ‘Peter grow some balls and bloody buy it (Bumbasina)‘.”

Carbery who also won the Northerly on Regal Power (2021) and Pounamu (2017) said his latest win in the race was his greatest moment in racing.

“This is by far my biggest thrill in racing” he said.

“We just got into a great spot and I was able to get off the fence.

“She settled so well. Just got a bit cluttered up a little bit and Searchin’ Roc’s started coming around but she quickened up so good through a pretty tight gap unbelievable.

“We set ourselves a plan to be here we never thought we’d definitely get here but we did.

“Plenty of doubters there’s always doubters but we never doubted her.”

Amelia’s Jewel joined Perfect Reflection (2015) Arcadia Queen (2018) and Kay Cee (2019) as fillies to win the Northerly named after WA’s champion galloper.

Carbery rode the multiple Group 1 winner 10 times during his illustrious career.

“Obviously I won on Northerly before so that makes it even more special” Carbery said.

“You would never have expected him to get to the heights he got to when I was riding him in his early days but he was always a good horse.”",,,

Once the game started it was overwhelming boos for Watson.

Watson heard jeers before taking each snap throughout the first half in his first game Sunday since returning from an 11-game suspension for sexual misconduct. Watson’s debut with Cleveland came against Houston where he was a three-time Pro Bowl pick in four seasons.

After an interception gave the Browns their first possession at their 43 Watson threw a pair of incomplete passes. He spun away from a sack on third down and fans cheered when his throw to David Bell hit the ground.

Watson’s first completed pass on his third attempt resulted in a turnover when Anthony Schwartz fumbled after a 12-yard gain. Watson later drove the Browns to Houston’s 11 before throwing an interception in the end zone.

Watson looked rusty after the nearly two-year layoff completing 8 of 14 passes for 96 yards and a pick. But the Browns took a 7-5 lead into halftime following a 76-yard punt return for a score by Donovan Peoples-Jones.

Watson had several supporters in the stands before the game while a group of the women who accused him of sexual harassment and assault during massages also planned to attend the game.

One fan walked into NRG Stadium wearing a derogatory shirt in Browns colors that includes text saying “I need a massage.” He was joined by a fan wearing Watson’s No. 4 Browns jersey.

Fans in the parking lot set up a fake massage table with a mannequin wearing a red Texans jersey and a towel.

The few fans in their seats when Watson and the Browns jogged onto the field about an hour before kickoff booed.

Watson sat out the 2021 season after demanding a trade from Houston. After two grand juries in Texas declined to indict him over the allegations the Browns traded several draft picks to get Watson and then signed him to a fully guaranteed $235 million contract.

After warming up Watson signed jerseys for fans behind the end zone. An 18-year-old man from East Texas got Watson’s autograph on his Browns jersey. A couple from Houston wearing Texans jerseys also got Watson’s signature on their jerseys.

“We don’t really know what happened and everyone deserves a second chance” said Sherry Holden explaining her support.

Several Browns fans said they were uncomfortable rooting for Watson.

“I’m cheering for the jersey and the team but it’s hard to accept him as my quarterback” said Brandon Collins who traveled from Ohio for the game.

The NFL wanted to suspend Watson for at least one season but settled for 11 games after an independent arbiter initially gave him a six-game ban. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell pointed to former U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson calling Watson’s behavior “egregious” and “predatory” in seeking the full suspension.

Watson also was fined $5 million and required to undergo professional counseling and therapy. Watson has maintained his innocence but also apologized to the women he impacted.

The Browns went 4-7 with veteran Jacoby Brissett filling in for Watson. The Texans are 1-9-1.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9zb21lb25lLWNyZWF0ZWQtcG9rZW1vbi1zbmFwLWluLWN1c3RvbS1mb3J0bml0ZS1tYXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Someone Created Pokemon Snap In A Custom Fortnite Map,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thegamer.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /someone-created-pokemon-snap-in-custom-fortnite-map/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C49239C400>, 'Connection to www.thegamer.com timed out.

If you happen to be a BMW owner whose car was manufactured after June 2022 with BMW's Operating System 8 and are experiencing some headaches in getting Alexa connected you are in luck.Just yesterday December 3 the German automaker posted a video on YouTube that walks you through the process in a clear and concise manner.The initial step involves activating Amazon Alexa Car with your My BMW app by tapping on your profile which will automatically bring up Amazon Alexa under '3rd Party Services.' By tapping that option you will be led to another screen where you will choose 'Alexa Car Integration.'You will then need to connect your BMW ID with your Amazon account via 'Connect.'

'To anyone else who has lost a parent I'm sending you so much love. It's a feeling unlike anything I've ever felt. I hope your loved ones have helped you find strength.'

To skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the Top 5 Infrastructure Companies in the US.

People in developed countries tend to take infrastructure for granted because they've grown up in countries and cities which have top infrastructure be it railroads roads bridges tunnels or even telecom. However only a small privileged percentage of the total global population enjoys this kind of security with most developing nations struggling to build even basic durable infrastructure which is also intrinsic to the success of any nation's economy.

The railroad in the U.S. is integral to continuing operations in the country and a shutdown would cause billions of dollars' worth of damage. All four of the major railroads in the country three of which are in our list of the top infrastructure companies in US reported some form of records profits in the previous year.

There are several issues which have governed the current railroad crisis which is threatening to spiral out of control. Railroad workers are governed under the Railway Labor Act which imposes restrictions on when unions can strike as opposed to most other unions in the country which are under no such obligation. Because of a breakdown in negotiations where railway management and the unions couldn't agree on a new deal President Biden ordered the unions to not go on strike and instead engage in a 60-day cooling off period as both sides would present proposals to the President in order to reach a better deal. At the forefront of this issue is sick leaves.

On the 1st of December 2022 the Senate rejected a proposal which would give railroad workers seven days of paid sick leaves. Immediately after President Biden signed a bill which would prevent the railroad workers from striking as that would devastate the country's economy.

The top infrastructure companies in the U.S. are giants of the industry providing employment to hundreds of thousands of people while recording hundreds of billions in revenue in total. To determine these companies we have considered their market cap revenue profit and assets assigning 30% weightage to the first three criteria and 10% to the last one.

BOUTTE — Buying selling or investing in a home is one of the biggest decisions in life. The team at UpMarket Realty has the tools to ensure a positive and successful experience with a friendly face constant communication and assistance with analyzing all of the details of the real estate process.

UpMarket Realty recently celebrated its grand opening at 13323 Highway 90 Suite B in Boutte alongside local officials and the River Region Chamber of Commerce.

The new office space is bright and beautiful representing a path forward for the community from the destruction of Hurricane Ida. The office is also unique in that it is connected to Southern Title facilitating a seamless closing process for clients.

UpMarket Realty serves not only St. Charles Parish but also the surrounding areas for St. John the Baptist Jefferson Orleans and St. Tammany parishes.

Co-owner Melissa Friloux and her husband Brennen have nearly two decades of experience buying selling renovating and flipping homes. Through their company Friloux Ventures Construction they have gained technical expertise and a keen eye for identifying the qualities of a good property from the bones to the personal design touches that make a house a home.

Co-owner Kourtne Donnaud entered the real estate world with a fresh perspective and an immense drive for helping others in the community. Her people-oriented nature and business-savvy background as owner of The Seafood Pot Restaurant in Destrehan is a winning combination when it comes to helping clients find their forever home or newest investment property.

Rounding out the UpMarket Realty team is Alison White a lifelong Southeast Louisiana resident who understands what makes the region a great place to live and work. With a background in education she is a licensed realtor who is passionate about guiding others through the buying and selling process.

“We are all very people-oriented. We want to be approachable and exemplify the true meaning of Southern hospitality through our work” Melissa Friloux said. “We want to support local businesses and be a really good staple of the community.”

According to Friloux UpMarket Realty stands apart though a high-end approach to marketing properties. The team is also very in tune with what brings value back from investments. Before ever talking about commission or putting a property on the market Friloux will sit down with a client and walk them through what they can do to add more value to their property when getting ready to list.

UpMarket Realty seeks to keep the public educated on changes in the real estate market. There’s no need to be afraid to make the move to buy or sell Friloux said.

“We are facing some insurance battles and some interest rate battles right now but I think the most important thing is that it’s not time to sit around and wait to buy or sell. There’s always an opportunity to refinance if rates go down” Friloux said. “When I got into the real estate market 16 years ago the norm was 3 or 4% interest rates. Now the rates have gone back to a new normal. The ultra-low interest rates we saw the past couple of years were not the norm and we got kind of spoiled with that.”

As the region continues to navigate changes to homeowners and flood insurance Friloux said UpMarket Realty is working closely with Riverlands Insurance to obtain the most up-to-date information for clients.

“Having a real estate agent is a must” Friloux said. “On the buyer side you’re not really coming out of pocket for many things but you are getting all of the knowledge and information you need to make a good investment. On the listing side right now with the market it’s best to have a good agent to be there to walk you through all of the different changes in the market and the knowledge needed to sell a home right now.”

Georgia Southern will meet Buffalo of the Mid-American Conference in the Camellia Bowl at noon ET on Tuesday Dec. 27 in Montgomery Alabama (ESPN).

“We are extremely excited to be a part of this year’s bowl season” GS first-year head coach Clay Helton said in a press release. “We would like to thank the Camellia Bowl and the great city of Montgomery for this wonderful invitation. Congratulations to the Buffalo football team on a terrific season. This is sure to be an exciting matchup and we look forward to getting started with preparation.”

It's the second trip to the Historic Cramton Bowl in Montgomery for the Eagles who defeated Eastern Michigan 23-21 in the Raycom Media Camellia Bowl on Dec. 15 2018.

The Camellia Bowl marks the first football meeting between GS and Buffalo. Both teams are 6-6 after qualifying for bowls in their final outing.

Few perks all the work:Elijah Hynes walks long path to help Georgia Southern football

Commentary:Why it's crucial for Georgia Southern now and in the future to play in a bowl game

There's a built-in storyline: Eagles starting quarterback Kyle Vantrease was a three-year starter for the Bulls before transferring in January to Statesboro. Vantrease a sixth-year player has broken many of the GS program's passing records in his lone season with the Eagles.

More local connections:

Brandon Bailey in his first season as Buffalo's defensive coordinator and safeties coach graduated cum laude from Georgia Southern in May 2016 where he received his bachelor's degree in health and physical education. In 2017 he served as co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Richmond Hill High School in Bryan County.

Buffalo's senior defensive quality control coach Nate Baker previously worked at Savannah State where he was the co-offensive coordinator/tackles and tight ends coach from 2019-21.

Baker began his coaching career at Georgia Southern in 2008 as an undergraduate analyst for running backs quarterbacks offensive linemen and cornerbacks. From 2013-15 Baker was the offensive graduate assistant at Georgia Southern.

Buffalo linebackers coach Kevin Corless spent two seasons at Georgia Southern. In 2012 he guided the linebackers and then served as co-defensive coordinator with Jack Curtin in 2013. The 2012 squad advanced to the FCS national semifinals and the 2013 team beat Florida but was not eligible for postseason play as the Eagles made the jump to FBS.

The bowl game triggered bonuses for the Georgia Southern coaching staff. Helton will receive $25000 in addition to his $700000 base salary for his first year (November 2021 to Dec. 31 2022).

Offensive coordinator Bryan Ellis and defensive coordinator Will Harris for example are each earning $235000 in base salary in their first seasons coaching in Statesboro. They each receive $5000 for the team going to a bowl game and would earn another $5000 if the Eagles defeat the Bulls.

“I would like to thank the Camellia Bowl for the invitation to play in the postseason” said Georgia Southern Director of Athletics Jared Benko. “We are excited to extend our season by playing Buffalo in Montgomery as our seniors have earned a chance to line up and wear the blue and white one last time. Our 2018 win in the Camellia Bowl was one to remember and I know our fans look forward to traveling to Montgomery and supporting our team.”

Georgia Southern has previous bowl victories in the GoDaddy Bowl (2015) Camellia Bowl (2018) and New Orleans Bowl (2020) and appeared in the 2019 Cure Bowl.

The Sun Belt Conference following its expansion this summer to a 14-team football league set an league record with GS and six other teams participating in bowls — tied for the most among non-autonomy conferences and trailing only the SEC ACC Big Ten and Big 12.

From a rearranged boarding process to upgraded Wi-Fi connectivity the Southwest travel experience will be getting some big updates in the coming months. The Dallas-based airline shared a slew of updates at a recent media event at its headquarters and TPG was invited to learn more about what's coming for Southwest flyers.

Executives detailed what passengers can expect to see in the coming months — and there is a lot to get excited about. Here's the latest.

Old routes before new ones

When the pandemic hit Southwest like much of the aviation industry went into crisis mode. The airline cut many of its routes and parked a chunk of its fleet.

More than two years later demand has finally come roaring back. The airline has largely recovered to pre-pandemic operational levels but there are still some routes primarily longer domestic ones that haven't yet returned to the schedule.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

Next year the airline is going to continue to focus on rebuilding its network Andrew Watterson Southwest's chief operating officer told reporters with a goal of bringing most pre-pandemic routes back by the third quarter of 2023.

While Southwest added about 18 pins to its route map during the pandemic the airline isn't planning another blockbuster year of new cities. That growth was opportunistic said CEO Bob Jordan who shared that many of these new cities were already under consideration before the pandemic.

For next year Southwest is largely focused on resumptions which should hopefully mean more nonstop flights in your market.

Network depth over new cities

In addition to restoring connectivity the airline will also ensure that it brings back frequencies in existing markets.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

For example some routes don't currently have enough service for a business traveler to do a day trip leaving in the morning and returning at night. That's something that Watterson and the network team are working to address as the airline fully recovers.

Southwest plans to bring back all of its pre-pandemic frequencies in existing markets which will hopefully help the airline win the business of some of its customers that are booking based on time and schedule.

Better Wi-Fi is here

In recent years one of the biggest complaints from Southwest frequent flyers has been the reliability of inflight Wi-Fi.

The airline is well aware of the problem said Tony Roach Southwest's vice president of customer experience and engagement. He reiterated that the airline plans to upgrade its entire fleet of Boeing 737 with better Wi-Fi access.

Existing planes will continue to be outfitted with Anuvu (formerly Global Eagle) connectivity but pieces of the hardware including the wireless access points will be upgraded to deliver more bandwidth and lower latency.

So far 260 aircraft has been upgraded and the airline plans to have 350 done by the end of January. Fleet-wide completion is expected before the third quarter of 2023. Roach noted that the upgraded systems are already delivering noticeably better performance and reliability.

In addition to upgrading the existing provider Southwest will debut Viasat connectivity on its newly delivered Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft beginning in the first quarter. Viasat has historically offered one of if not the most reliable inflight internet connections so travelers should get excited about this new provider.

Wi-Fi will remain priced at $8 a day Roach said but the airline is working on how to integrate both providers into its flat all-day pricing.

Asked about whether Wi-Fi will eventually be free Roach mentioned that the upgraded systems could theoretically support free internet access but Southwest would need to purchase more bandwidth to make that happen. (The airline trialed a free Wi-Fi test this summer to learn more about the system's capabilities.)

Power ports are coming

Southwest's history of operating shorter domestic routes means that the carrier hasn't necessarily innovated in the passenger experience.

In recent years however the airline has been flying longer and longer missions including new and expanded service to Hawaii from various cities in the West such as Las Vegas Phoenix San Diego and Los Angeles.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

These flights routinely take over five hours and Southwest is addressing a big pain point of these longer-haul missions with the addition of power ports.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

There'll be USB-C and -A ports at the back of each seat which will be capable of providing up to 60 Watts of power. There won't be any 110V universal power outlets since those would add too much weight to the plane Roach said.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

Power ports will be available on new 737 MAX 8 models as of June 2023 followed by a larger retrofit after the new deliveries are complete.

New overhead bins and seats

Gate-checking your bag will (hopefully) happen less frequently on future Southwest flights.

That's thanks to new larger overhead bins that are debuting on new MAX 8 aircraft next year. These bins can accommodate up to six standard-size rollaboards if they're arranged on their sides as opposed to on their backs.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

Along with the new bins Southwest will install its next-generation seats on these planes. They're decked out in a blue leather-like material and they feature adjustable headrests that wing for extra neck support.

There's a literature and storage pocket behind each seat along with a standard-size tray table. Pitch will measure 32 inches.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

Southwest publicly demoed the new cabin mockup for the first time during the media day event and TPG's Summer Hull was quite impressed with the layout. It may not be the most comfortable seat for a six-hour flight but it should do the trick for most flyers.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY 0 1 2

A redesigned family boarding

Southwest does boarding differently. There are no assigned seats and passengers are instead boarded by position number. Once onboard you can choose any open seat.

This can be quite stressful for families who might be worried about finding seats together. Historically Southwest has offered family boarding after all the flyers in the A group have gone onto the plane.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

There are 60 boarding positions within the A group so sitting together as a family could be a challenge on busy flights.

In the coming weeks the airline will trial a revamped family boarding program that allows two adults and children child six years old or younger to board before the A group. In exchange for skipping the boarding queue families will need to sit in the back of the plane.

Depending on the outcome of the trial Southwest may consider rolling out this change more broadly.

Turn times are more important than ever

When Southwest was founded back in 1971 the airline was famous for its 10-minute turns. The airline would deplane one flight and board the next one in 10 minutes allowing the carrier to fly a ton of frequencies on any given day.

New regulatory requirements weight and balance paperwork and larger airplanes have all caused the turn time to increase according to Watterson but the airline is still laser-focused on minimizing the number of minutes it takes to deplane and board.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

If it can shave off just a few more minutes from each turn the airline might be able to add one more frequency for each given aircraft. That would translate into much more revenue without adding too many costs since most of them are fixed anyway Watterson said.

Initiatives like digitalizing the pre-departure paperwork and improving the signage in the gate area are two ways that Southwest plans to minimize turn time in 2023 and beyond.

Expect more 'golden hours' flights

As Southwest adds more frequencies to its network expect to see more flights during ""golden hours"" according to Watterson.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

These flights which typically operate between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. are (perhaps unsurprisingly) the most popular. Minimizing turn time to add one more flight during the daylight hours is of the utmost importance he stressed.

Flexibility is here to stay

In recent years Southwest has historically had the most flexible ticket policies.

All of the airline's fares can be changed or canceled up to 10 minutes before departure without incurring any additional fees other than a possible fare difference. Contrast that to the legacy U.S. airlines which used to tack on a $200 (or more) change fee and you'd save big money when modifying trips with Southwest.

During the pandemic most major U.S. airlines matched Southwest and permanently dropped change fees but Southwest didn't rest on its laurels. The airline announced in June that flight credits would never expire and it even recently introduced a new fare product dubbed Wanna Get Away Plus that allows you to transfer flight credit to another person.

Southwest executives reiterated that this flexibility is here to stay in 2023 and beyond. The purpose of these policies Jordan said is to drive repeat business.

Solving frustrations

Southwest's technology hasn't always been the most robust but it's getting better.

Recently the carrier debuted the ability to add a lap infant on its website something that previously required a visit to a full-service check-in counter. Digitalizing this functionality saves families tons of time and allows them to check in online and bypass the airport desk.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

Additionally the airline is now selling upgraded A1-A15 boarding positions directly in its mobile app. This ancillary fee which ranges from $30 to $60 depending on flight distance was previously only collected within an hour of departure at the airport.

These are just the two latest examples of ways that the airline is digitalizing the travel experience. Executives mentioned that more initiatives are underway but they didn't reveal any details just yet.

New airport infrastructure

This year the airline unveiled renovated and expanded operations in two key markets Denver and Phoenix.

Executives touted these projects as being key to growth especially in Denver where Southwest will now have access to 40 gates as it competes fiercely with United there.

Looking ahead Southwest is excited about the new terminal opening in Kansas City where it's working with local officials to customize the design for its operational needs. Expect that facility to open in February or March of 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3NvdXRod2VzdC11bml0ZWQtYW5kLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWhhdmUtYS1uZXctZW5lbXktdGhlLWludGVybmV0cy11Z2xpZXN0LXNpdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest United and American Airlines have a new enemy -- the internet's ugliest site,"Getty Images

I'm constantly being told that data is all-important. I'm not quite convinced.

Sometimes the evidence of my own eyes and life experience -- subjective data you might call it -- will always triumph over a spreadsheet a graph or a trumpeting startup founder.

I wonder then what you might think of a site for sore eyes that desperately wants to make your life more beautiful.

When I first saw DataScalp -- I know the name doesn't resonate with prettiness -- I wondered whether the creator's own eyes and life experience hadn't been quite what they could have been.

That name may inspire some to muse: ""Dear Lord why?"" And the site well it looks like a forgotten concoction from 1997's less creative period.

Yet DataScalp's mission is to make your flying experience better thanks to oh yes data. And not data provided by DataScalp but by miserable people like you who have endured terrible flying experiences.

Also: These are my 5 must-have devices for work travel now

What the site provides is a running score of airline cancellations baggage accuracy on-time performance and cancellation time to refund.

But I ask you can't you already find all this around the web? Doesn't this information already exist? And perhaps most importantly given that Americans have so few actual choices when they fly will this data influence any human behavior?

I asked DataScalp's creator Dwight Harris Jr. about some of my misgivings.

He told me: ""This content relies upon inferential statistics to mimic the information that airlines actually have but withhold. DataScalp content is based upon commodity services. It's not based upon taste like Yelp which is subjective and does not allow ranking.""

He also offered an intriguing thought: ""Consumers gravitating towards good performers leaves inventory abundance for airlines which pushes prices down. Therefore consumers via DataScalp literally impact prices unlike any other platform.""

Also: The best travel VPNS

I wonder if that'll be the case.

And what of the name? Isn't it a little contentious?

Not to Wright Jr.: ""You scalp tickets so DataScalp removes the ambiguity around information. Coming up with any company name and website that has the word data is extraordinarily difficult. DataScalp as a name is a godsend.""

Who am I to argue when God is invoked?

But the airlines have now got their act together haven't they? At least that's what the airlines say. Why the Thanksgiving period seemed relatively peaceful. Even Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg thought so.

Ah but Harris Jr. insists things will get worse. He told me: ""The only reason Thanksgiving travel was relatively easy was due to climate change providing a relatively warm November. But airlines haven't changed anything. So when the weather gets colder it's going to exacerbate problems that have always been there.""

Yes but it's always been this way hasn't it? Especially on the east coast. Nothing can change the shifting tides of storms.

Harris Jr. doesn't agree. He said: ""Airlines aren't going to change until we get reliable customer feedback that can't be siloed or hidden in one of those customer feedback forms. While DataScalp isn't pretty it's ready to fix an ugly problem: Airline travel.""

Also: In-flight Wi-Fi is a nightmare but fixes could be on the way

I confess to finding it hard to see how the collected thoughts of angry American flyers can make any difference at all. It never has. Airlines know that you can complain all you like but when four airlines own more than 80% of the seats you have to take what you can get and be grateful you got to your destination.

Perhaps this winter will be DataScalp's takeoff. Hark at Harris Jr.'s portentous tones: ""Winter is coming for the airline industry. I expect December travel to be some of the worst yet.""

I suppose you have nothing to lose by offering your views to this new Reddit of the Air. And Wright Jr. insists his site will change human behavior. (Yes really.)

""I've worked on Wall Street for a decade"" he told me. ""I've successfully changed corporate behavior at the highest levels. This approach is proven to work.""

But of course.

(WKBW) — As the holiday season gets underway there is no question that this will be a busier travel season than the last two years of the pandemic and having travel restrictions.

To make it easier to travel for families who have members with special needs the Buffalo Niagara International Airport has a pre-travel plan for you.

Williamsville mother of two Dorene Major said traveling can be exciting but can be daunting for her son 10-year-old max.

""When you have a family of four you want to go travel but obviously autism can put a wrench in those plans"" mother Dorene Major said.

Max is on the autism spectrum and depending on if the destination interests him he can be a little less receptive.

That is where ""social stories"" come in hand.

""What we might here and it kind of goes in the back of the head they'll hear it and it's like 20 times louder and then they pick up 30 different things. So it's practice actually just constantly pushing them out of that element and letting them hear it. Then maybe removing them when it does get a little overwhelming"" Major said.

Buffalo Airport's Southwest Airlines station manager Megan Sawyer said ""We actually do a tour here with them and I will walk them through with myself and TSA and a member of the airport. We'll walk through and we'll show their bags getting dropped on the bell kind of the system.""

For a walk-through travelers can call (716) 635-1200 ten days before travel date to get a hold of a Passenger Support Specialist.

Many agents at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport are also trained in sign language.

Major said ""We travel every couple of months. We do road trips but then we go on flights at least twice a year. We actually physically take him out of that norm out of that element. It's good to push them out of their elements a little bit. They are less stressed out when their routines actually do change.""

To make traveling safer and easier for the blind and visually impaired the airport has also partnered up with an app called ""Aira"" since 2019 that will help them connect with a travel agent that would assist getting through the airport.

Major said ""Just letting everybody know ahead of time. 'Hey I have a child that's on the spectrum.' When you get to the gate tell them that. They'll let you board first. Or if it's better that you board last then they'll keep an area clear for you and you can come on last.""

The Pre-Travel Preparation Program is also open to kids who have a fear or phobia of flying.

""I think it's been really well-received. We've had people come back and give us really great positive feedback and they had a really positive experience on their first flight because we did the tour and we went through it with them. They were very excited when they came and they were no longer scare or apprehensive about it"" Sawyer said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXhzdGFyLW1lZGlhLXdpcmUvd2hpY2gtYWlybGluZS1pcy10aGUtbW9zdC1yZWxpYWJsZS1pbi0yMDIyL9IBRWh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy93aGljaC1haXJsaW5lLWlzLXRoZS1tb3N0LXJlbGlhYmxlLWluLTIwMjIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which airline is the most reliable in 2022?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://ktla.com/news/nexstar-media-wire/which-airline-is-the-most-reliable-in-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXhzdGFyLW1lZGlhLXdpcmUvd2hpY2gtYWlybGluZS1pcy10aGUtbW9zdC1yZWxpYWJsZS1pbi0yMDIyL9IBRWh0dHBzOi8va3RsYS5jb20vbmV3cy93aGljaC1haXJsaW5lLWlzLXRoZS1tb3N0LXJlbGlhYmxlLWluLTIwMjIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

EAST LYME Conn. — Two men were caught allegedly making $1800 worth of fraudulent purchases at Starbucks cafes around the region including in Connecticut according to East Lyme police.

Dante Isaac 31 of Hartford and Antwone Washington 30 of Far Rockaway New York were arrested Thursday night at the Starbucks on Flanders Road in East Lyme police said.

Officers were called to that Starbucks location for a report of a disturbance between staff and two men involving the fraudulent use of a credit card.

The fraud victim who lives in Delaware told the store's staff there were unauthorized charges made to her credit card from the East Lyme Starbucks as well as from other Starbucks locations according to police.

Police searched the suspects' rental vehicle which had around $1800 worth of Starbucks merchandise inside.

It was determined that the men had been going to Starbucks locations around Connecticut New York and Pennsylvania to buy Starbucks merchandise with the victim's credit card and to try to return other merchandise from other stores according to receipts police said they found in the vehicle.

Isaac and Washington face multiple charges including larceny ill use of credit card and identity theft.

Washington was initially held on a $25000 bond and Isaac was held on a $10000 bond but police said the bail commissioner reduced Washington's bond to $5000 and Isaac's to a promise to appear. Both are scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 9.

There was no fire engine escort and no welcoming party.

The Friars bus emptied into a lot of prideful but exhausted parents most of whom had also traveled the seven hours to the shores of Lake Erie to support the team making its first appearance in the Catholic High School state championship in Hamburg N.Y.

Just eight hours earlier St. Anthony’s had scored four touchdowns in the final 13 minutes to erase a 20-point deficit and produce a wild 27-20 comeback win over St. Francis of Buffalo to capture the CHSFL Class AAA state crown.

A Friars offense that could not gain any traction for nearly three quarters found a spark and scored 27 unanswered points for the improbable win.

The game’s final play was St. Francis quarterback Steve Otremba stepping up into the pocket from the Friars 24-yard line and zeroing in on his receiver in the end zone. As Otremba set to throw defensive end Thomas Mackell stripped the ball from his grip as the final seconds ticked off the clock. A euphoric celebration ensued.

“As bad as it looked midway through the third quarter our guys never gave up” St. Anthony’s coach Joe Minucci said. “They continued to grind and believe. This win will go down as an all-timer.”

A crowd of more than 1000 braved snow squalls and 52 mile per hour winds that sent the real feel into the teens to witness the biggest comeback in state final history.

“It was the coldest windiest conditions we’ve ever played in” St. Anthony’s quarterback Dante Torres said. “It was ridiculous. Our defense and special teams played a great second half to make the comeback possible. We made the right adjustments and pulled it out.”

Torres scored on two short runs and halfback Frank Ruta added two scoring runs. Ruta ran for 138 yards on 19 carries.

To advance to the state final St. Anthony’s (11-1) upended powerhouse Iona Prep 50-18 to claim the Catholic crown. Torres totaled 509 all-purpose yards in that win including four touchdown passes to junior wide receiver Korey Duff Jr.

It was a CHSFL-record 15th title for the Friars. Torres finished the season with 32 touchdown passes and 3327 passing yards second all-time behind Sayville’s Jack Coan who had 3431.

“When we can throw it all over the field we are a very dangerous offense” Minucci said. “We had such a good balance with the run and pass this season.”

That balance proved beneficial in the state title game when the Friars' vertical passing game was neutralized by the inclement weather. The O-line stepped up and opened holes for the running game.

The Friars' season may have been defined by a high-octane offense that averaged 44 points per game. But in the championship it was defense and special teams that keyed an unforgettable second half.

After the awards ceremony in Hamburg the champs hit the road.

“We had some food and got out of there because they were expecting more bad weather” Minucci said. “The excitement lasted about an hour on the bus and then they all crashed for the long ride home. It was a great ride.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYWxlbW5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdXBlci1ib3dsLXNob2NrZXItc3Qtam9obnMtcHJlcC1ibGFua3MtcG93ZXJob3VzZS1zcHJpbmdmaWVsZC1jZW50cmFsLXdpbnMtc3RhdGUtdGl0bGUvYXJ0aWNsZV83NjQ5NDQyOC03MzcxLTExZWQtYWVhOS1iYjNiMjc5ODM4MzcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SUPER BOWL SHOCKER: St. John's Prep blanks powerhouse Springfield Central wins state title,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYWxlbW5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdXBlci1ib3dsLXNob2NrZXItc3Qtam9obnMtcHJlcC1ibGFua3MtcG93ZXJob3VzZS1zcHJpbmdmaWVsZC1jZW50cmFsLXdpbnMtc3RhdGUtdGl0bGUvYXJ0aWNsZV83NjQ5NDQyOC03MzcxLTExZWQtYWVhOS1iYjNiMjc5ODM4MzcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C491C3D1E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Willie McGonigle | December 3 2022

Since dropping their season opener to St. Thomas Aquinas the Hawks of St. Joseph’s Prep have been on a roll winning 10 consecutive games. On Saturday at windy rain-soaked Charles Martin Stadium at Northeast High School the Hawks extended their win streak to 11 with dominating 48-7 victory over the District 1 Champion Garnet Valley Jaguars.

The win sends the Hawks to their eighth straight State Championship appearance.

The Hawks came out firing on all cylinders posting 27 first quarter points. Samaj Jones got the scoring party started on the game’s opening drive when he raced 21 yards to the endzone. After forcing the Jaguars to a three and out the Hawks offense took over and again found the endzone this time it was Erik Sanchez taking it from 12 yards out. Khaseem Phillips would go 43 yards untouched up the gut of the Jaguars defense to make it 21-0. The final Hawks touchdown of the first quarter was via Jones’s arm has he connected with David Washington for 55 yard touchdown.

While by the time the second quarter started the rain subsided the storm that was the Hawks offense kept pouring it scoring three more times in the quarter with Jones throwing two more touchdown passes to Brandon Rehmann and Michael DiTrolio that sandwiched an Isaiah West touchdown run.

In all the Hawkds offense nearly tallied 350 yards of total offense in the first half.

The Hawks defense was just has impressive holding the Jaguars vaunted run heavy offense to a under 40 yards of total offense for the half and not allowing the Jaguars to gain a first down without a penalty till the clocked showed almost 4 minutes left.

The lone blemish on the Hawks defense came with 9:04 left in the fourth quarter when Matt Mesaros connected with a wide-open Drew Van Horn for a 24-yard touchdown.

The Hawks advance to face Harrisburg on Saturday in the 6A Championship while the Jaguars season ends with a record of 13-1.

Special to The News-Messenger

Seventy-five years ago — give or take a year or so here or there — plenty of things were happening to impact life locally.

The Fremont Bypass and the Ohio Turnpike were both completed and the St. Lawrence Seaway was moving toward being able to pass ocean-going ships through. The 1956 Fremont ConSurvey Directory had this to say about the seaway: “When the great St. Lawrence Seaway is completed (1959) there is reason to believe northern Ohio in which Fremont and Sandusky County are located will reap the benefits of this enormous project.”

Also in Fremont and surrounding area a $2.9 million bond issue was approved for additional elementary school space and a new senior high school which was recently torn down as part of the latest new high school project. Back in 1956 the directory pointed out that “This development will bring a modern senior high school offering a comprehensive high school program.” Also in 1956 a new parochial high school — St. Joseph’s — was opened. And two years later a new parochial elementary school — Sacred Heart — opened as part of the new church campus on the east side of the city.

Whirlpool purchased Clyde Porcelain Steel in 1952

In Clyde Whirlpool Corporation purchased the Clyde Porcelain Steel Co. in 1952 and began producing washing machines there and then purchased the Bendix Corporation in 1954. The company has been a key industry for the county since.

The Fremont directory brings back many memories.

Rodger Young Park featured a popular swimming pool as well as ball diamonds; model airplane circles; horseshoe tennis and shuffleboard courts; outdoor dancing facilities; shelter houses and an amphitheater.

Greyhound buses and other “franchised” lines served the city regularly with stops at Tremper’s on West State Street between Front and Arch streets.

Fremont Post Office was considered a modern operation

The Fremont Post Office building which included a variety of government offices on the second floor was referred to as “a modern one in every respect.” Now the home of Pontifex the building stopped housing the post office when that government agency moved to a new home on Enterprise Drive north of the city.

At least that building still stands. Many others do not.

The Fremont Opera House stood mostly unused in the 1950s until it was demolished to make way for Liberty National Bank on the northwest corner of Arch and State streets. A series of banking firms followed until US Bank closed its office at that site.

Fremont’s classic old City Hall on the southwest corner of Arch and Croghan streets was torn down following the “funnel cloud aloft” storm of June 30 1977. Fourteen years later the News-Messenger completed its move from downtown to Cedar Street. That not-so-beautiful old building which was right across Arch Street from the old City Hall was later torn down to make room for the expansion of the Croghan Colonial Bank.

Another beautiful old building that came down in this time frame was the National Bank Building which stood at the southeast corner of Front and Arch streets where the Credit Union parking lot is now.

Other companies of note back then included The Howard Zink Corp. Paul E. Spieldenner the S.E. Hyman Company Herbrand the Fremont Foundry Consolite Fremont Savings Bank Gottron Brothers Price Lumber and Winters Hardware.

That’s just a few to jog memories of longtime Fremonters.

All Animal procedures of this study carried out at the German Primate Center in Gottingen Germany were approved by the responsible regional government office [Niedersaechsisches Landesamt fuer Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (LAVES)] under permit numbers 33.42502/08–07.02 and 33.14.42502–04-064/07. Moreover whole experiments and analysis methods declared in the manuscript follow the recommendations in the ARRIVE guidelines. We also confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. For more information about the experimental procedure details of surgical techniques and methods used for animal training see6.

Experimental task and electrophysiological recording

We trained a male macaque monkey to attend to one of two stimuli presented on the monitor screen. The animal was seated in a custom-built primate chair fixing its head and stabilizing its body from excessive movements while performing the task. Each trial was started by touching a lever bar and maintaining the gaze on a central fixation point for 130 ms. Upon gazing at the central fixation a static random dot pattern (RDP) appeared for 455 ms presenting the position of the target stimulus on the screen. Following a blank period (325 ms) two moving RDPs appeared inside and outside the receptive field (RF) for a random duration of 680 ms to 4250 ms. The two RDPs had the same size adjusted manually to be matched the size of the classical RF of the neuron recorded in each session. They were always positioned symmetrically around the fixation point. The direction of motion in both target and non-target (distractor) RDPs were the same selected randomly from eight possible directions (between 0–360° with steps of 45°) in the polar coordinate system. After passing a random period from displaying the RDPs a brief direction change occurred in one of two RDPs. The monkey was rewarded with a drop of juice after correctly identifying the change in the target stimulus and ignoring the change in the distractor. The reward was not delivered when the monkey (i) released the lever for a distractor change (ii) broke his gaze on the fixation spot during the trial or (iii) responded too late after the target change. Overall the monkey could successfully identify the changes in the target stimulus for 86% of the trials without fixation breaks. He imperfectly finished 3 and 11% of trials either by replying to non-target changes (false alarms) or by terminating them without executing any response (miss trials) respectively. The task design and behavioral paradigm are illustrated in Fig. 1.

Figure 1 Experimental procedures. The monkey began each trial of the task by pressing a lever bar and maintaining its gaze on a fixation point (multiplication sign) for 130 ms. Then a static RDP appeared for 455 ms to show the position of the target stimulus on the screen to the animal. After the cue presentation the screen became blank for 325 ms and the monkey was required to preserve its gaze on the fixation point then. Next two moving RDPs with the same direction of motion emerged on screen for a random period of 680–4250 ms. Immediately after a direction change occurred in one of the two RDPs and the monkey was instructed to release the lever if the change happened in the cued position. The dashed circle indicates the classical RF of the neuron on the screen. The circle was not depicted to the monkey in the actual task experiments. All analyses were carried out on the analysis window during the stimulus presentation period delineated by a grey shadow in the figure. Full size image

We recorded the extracellular activity of MT neurons using a multi-channel recording system (Mini-Matrix Thomas Recording and Plexon data acquisition system Plexon Inc.). The extracellular signals were split into local field potentials (LFPs; 1–300 Hz) and single-unit neural activities (SUAs) using 4-pole Bessel low-pass and high-pass digital filters at cut-off frequencies of 300 Hz and 500 Hz respectively. The filters were hardware embedded in the recording system (Plexon Dallas TX USA) set as the default option to extract extracellular signal components. Then the SUAs and the LFPs were amplified and digitized at 40 and 1 kHz respectively. We eliminated the power line noise (50 Hz) from the LFPs using a non-causal 4th-order Butterworth notch filter. The SUA was isolated online using Plexon’s online sorter application system. Overall the collected data were recorded from 111 cortical sites using up to five parallel electrodes advanced into brain tissue to isolate direction-selective MT neurons overlapping RFs (linear electrode arrangement with an inter-electrode distance of 300 µm). These electrodes were not chronically implanted but were inserted simultaneously in each experimental session. We identified MT sites using their anatomical location in the cortex (by employing structural MRI imaging) and their physiological properties which were direction-selective when the average diameter of their RF was almost equal to the RF eccentricity. It is clear that the RF centers of MT neurons for different locations are anatomically located along the superior temporal sulcus in the cortex.

Data-analysis procedure

Details of quantitative procedures and analytical approaches applied to recordings are described in the following sections. All our analyses of the recorded data were implemented by taking advantage of MATLAB software (R2017b; MathWorks Natick MA United States).

Trial selection approach

Trials whose target change was correctly reported by the monkey (hit trial) were considered for further analyses. These trials were divided into two subclasses of “target-in” or “target-out” according to whether the target RDP appeared inside or outside the RF respectively. We equalized the number of trials between the two subclass; therefore there were 4661 trials in each subset. We further categorized the hit trials into “fast” and “slow” subsets based on the animal’s reaction time (RT). For this purpose trials recorded from each neuron were sorted depending on their RTs in an ascendant order and subdivided into five equal subsets60. Then trials belonging to the first and the last subset were labeled as the fast and slow trials respectively. This segregation routine was frequently used in other studies26606162636465 investigating the relationship between attention\working memory-dependent modulation in the early visual cortex and behavioral improvement. We did not analyze the trials in the middle subsets due to no substantial differences in their neural correlates of behavior (reference65 Supplementary materials Fig. 5). All analyses of our study were carried out on SUAs and LFPs recorded from the same electrode during the stimulus presentation period. The analysis window bore 1500 ms length starting from about 600 ms following the stimulus onset and ending before stimulus change. We ensured that this analysis window was far from the stimulus onset which produces stimulus-induced changes in the brain’s rhythmicity (oscillatory activity)66676869. The supplementary figure S2 (Monkey H) in reference6 illustrated the temporal dynamic of the stimulus-evoked responses induced by the onset of motion stimuli.

Data analysis

Instantaneous frequency

We calculated the time-varying estimate of the instantaneous frequency (IF) using a modified form of a method developed by M.X Cohen22. First single-trial LFP signals were band-pass filtered using a zero-phase windowed harmonic wavelet transform (WHWT) filter59. The following equation expresses the WHWT in the frequency domain;

$$W_{H} (f) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}l} {A + B\cos \left( {2\pi \left( {sf - \eta } \right)} \right)} \hfill & {2\pi \left| {\overline{f} - f} \right| < \pi {/}s} \hfill \\ 0 \hfill & {{\text{elsewhere}}} \hfill \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (1)

where \(\overline{f} = \eta /s\) represents the frequency center \(\eta\) shows the frequency center of the harmonic wavelet at scale \(s = 1\) (i.e. the mother wavelet) \(b_{f} = 1/s\) defines the bandwidth of wavelet function and \(AB\) are two constant parameters adjusted on \(A = B = 1/\sqrt 3\). We filtered LFPs in a frequency range between 1 to 250 Hz with a step of 1 Hz and a bandwidth of 4 Hz. Since the WHWT filter has a Gaussian shape in the frequency domain many frequency-overlapping filters (using 250 numbers of WHWTs) were used to avoid an impending bias of estimated IF toward the peak frequency of the Gaussian. The filtered signals obtained by applying WHTW on an LFP comprised a real (\(x\left( t \right)\)) and an imaginary (\(y\left( t \right)\)) part. We next used \(x\left( t \right)\) and \(y\left( t \right)\) to calculate the IF for each filtered signal by employing a two-point finite impulse response (FIR) differentiator defined as follows70;

$$F(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi T}\arctan \left( {\frac{{x(t)y\left( {t + T} \right) - x(t + T)y(t)}}{{x(t)x\left( {t + T} \right) - y(t)y(t + T)}}} \right)$$ (2)

where \(T = 1/f_{s}\) and \(f_{s}\) determine the sample period and sampling frequency of the LFP signal (1 kHz) respectively. In contrast to traditional approaches to IF calculation the two-point FIR differentiator estimates the IF with a minimum number of non-physiological frequency jumps arising from temporal decreases in the signal-to-noise ratio of the filtered signal70. The estimated IF was further filtered ten times using median filters with ten different window widths equally spaced between 10 and 400 ms22. The median of different median-filter windows estimated the IF in each trial. Applying multiple median filters can prevent spectral leakage of spike waveform7172 into IF estimation. Next IFs of each trial (with the resolution frequency of 1 Hz) were averaged over each frequency range including Delta (1–4 Hz) Theta (4–8 Hz) Alpha (8–13 Hz) Beta (13–30 Hz) low-Gamma (30–50 Hz) mid-Gamma (50–70) and high-Gamma (70–120). Now we measured the average IF in seven different frequency bands for each trial of a recording site. Finally the IFs estimated on each frequency band were averaged across trials of each recording site. Figures 2 3A 5A 6A and 7A represents the IF averaged over the analysis window and recording sites in a frequency band.

Correlation between IF modulation and modulation in neural firing-rates

We measured the magnitude of changes in the firing rate of SUAs against the magnitude of changes in the IF averages for every recording site using target-in and target-out trials. The two parameters were computed on each site using SUAs and LFPs recorded from the same electrode. For this purpose the spike-rate modulation index (SP MI ) and the IF modulation index (IF MI ) was computed using the following equations;

$${\text{SP}}_{{{\text{MI}}}} = \frac{{Sp_{in} - Sp_{out} }}{{Sp_{in} + Sp_{out} }}$$ (3)

$${\text{IF}}_{{{\text{MI}}}} = \frac{{IFav_{in} - IFav_{out} }}{{IFav_{in} + Fav_{out} }}$$ (4)

where \(Sp\) and \(IFav\) represent the trials-averaged firing rate of an SUA and the trials-averaged of IF respectively both measured from the same recording site and on the same analysis window. Furthermore \(\left( \cdot \right)_{in}\) and \(\left( \cdot \right)_{out}\) implicate the parameters estimated at the target-in and target-out conditions respectively. We pooled pairs of (SP MI  IF MI ) obtained for individual MT sites and then removed those outlier pairs that exceeded the mean ± 2 × standard deviations (SD) of the pooled data (6 outlier pairs removed from the total 111 ones). Finally the Spearman correlation was employed to measure the magnitude of the correlation between SP MI and IF MI values (see Fig. 4). It is worth noting that we conducted the same routine to eliminate outliers from analyses of correlation shown in Figs. 5CD 6CD and 9BC.

Spike-frequency Granger causality for fast and slow trials

Having segregated the fast and slow trials using the method described above we selected those trials from each MT site whose spike rates (SR) satisfied the following thresholds;

$$Tr_{1} \le SR \le TR_{2}$$ (5)

where \(Tr_{1} = 9\) and \(Tr_{2} = 84\) are two thresholds calculated as follows;

$$Tr_{1} = median(SR_{all} ) - mad(SR_{all} )$$ (6)

$$Tr_{2} = median(SR_{all} ) + 2 \times mad(SR_{all} )$$ (7)

where \(SR_{all}\) is a vector comprised of spike rates from all MT sites \(median\left( \cdot \right)\) and \(mad\left( \cdot \right)\) are two operators computing “median” and “median absolute deviation” respectively. We next measured the causality relationship between the IF and spiking activity of selected trials in each MT site using a method proposed by Gong et al.73. Indeed the SR thresholds (defined in Eq. (5)) made the causality estimates of different recording sites comparable due to eliminating trials with outlier SRs from each recording site. It is important to note that most recording sites (98 sites out of 111 ones) were preserved after applying the SR thresholds. Since the causality approach was conducted on each recording site for fast RT trials (Fig. 8) the removed recording sites might include no fast RT trials passing the SR threshold criteria.

Spike-triggered average of IF (STA IF ) and spike-frequency directionality measure

We calculated STA IF to examine IF variations around MT’s spikes in the frequency range of 4–13 Hz. For this purpose segments of the IF in a 350 ms time window surrounding spikes of each trial were extracted and then averaged across trials (Fig. 8). All (fast RT) trials containing at least one spike were used for this analysis. Furthermore we statistically compared the IF variation between the time window preceding the spike and the time window after it7475. For this purpose we calculated the differences between individual IFs of the time windows and the IF value at the spike event. We then subtracted the absolutes of IF differences in the second half window (i.e. the 350 ms window after the spike event) from the corresponding absolutes of IF differences in the first half window (i.e. the 350 ms window before the spike event) both of which have an equal time interval to the spike time. Finally the resulting values of subtraction averaged across all samples of a segment. By applying the same analytical procedure for whole segments extracted we obtained a distribution of IF variations whose median sign represents directional influences between MT’s firing activity and MT’s IF input7475. With this our results revealed a significant positive median implicating the IF input to the MT neuron causes spikes to generate (\(p < 0.04\) Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

Correlation between spike-phase coupling (SPC) and the neural IF

SPC represents oscillatory phase synchrony between the LFP and the single-unit spiking activity recorded simultaneously from a single electrode. To estimate the SPC in the fast and the slow RT trials of the target-in condition we employed the WHWT to filter the LFPs in a high-gamma frequency range of 190 to 210 Hz with a step of 2 Hz and a bandwidth of 2 Hz. The frequency range of 190–210 Hz was chosen based on a recent study indicating the maximum SPC differences in that frequency band between the fast and the slow RT trials6. Next the instantaneous phase (IP) of filtered signals was calculated by taking the tangent inverse of the ratio of its imaginary part to the real part. Finally we estimated the SPC on each trial by computing the magnitude of the circular average of IPs simultaneous to the spikes6. The SPC methods are susceptible to the number of spikes in the analysis window767778. To eliminate any potential bias to the spike rate we used a thinning procedure7879 to select trials whose number of spikes was higher than the median of spike rates in each recording site. With this 101 out of all 111 recording sites remained. Furthermore we randomly removed surplus spikes from each remaining trial until the median spike rate was reached. Having applied the same procedure on trials of a given MT site for 1000 repetitions and averaged the resulting SPCs we obtained a reliable SPC in each frequency band. The SPC of individual trials had also been smoothed with a window of 6 Hz before computing its average across frequency bands.

‘Project Summit’ Program’s first batch of budding engineers completes their training

December 2 2022: Sysco LABS Sri Lanka’s ‘Project Summit’ program recently celebrated the completion of training of its first batch of engineers. ‘Project Summit’ was launched in May this year to inspire and develop a new generation of future-ready engineers who can excel in the world of innovation and emerging tech. Batch 1 comprised undergraduates and graduates who were all mentored by senior talent at Sysco LABS to increase their technical knowledge and explore new technologies.

The 6-month program acts as a platform that facilitates accelerated growth for recruits straight from university enabling them to execute new tech concepts classified under ‘4th industrial revolution tech’ (4IR). During the training participants received exposure and mentorship on 4IR concepts such as Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning Virtual Reality and the Internet of Things. They were also familiarized with business domain knowledge project management best industry practices and processes to develop the right skills.

During their training participants focused on 4IR technologies including AI augmented reality and blockchain that could transform the food services sector. Some unique solutions included AI-based warehouse waste management solutions food freshness analyzers demand forecasting systems chatbots blockchain-based loyalty reward systems and interactive browsing on E-commerce platforms using augmented reality. To complete the program participants had to not just submit new concepts but instead they had to work with different technologies to create minimum viable products of their ideas – leading them to explore both the theoretical and practical application aspects of their proposed solutions.

Commenting on Project Summit Nishantha Hettiarachchi Director – Enterprise and Architecture at Sysco LABS said: “Project Summit fosters a new generation of engineers ready to meet the demands of a tech-driven world. It is built to showcase Sri Lanka’s ingenuity and how prepared we are as a nation to disrupt the future. Project Summit was designed to be a launch pad for fresh graduates to execute the new technologies they studied about in universities in a real-world working environment”.

“The brilliant young minds in the first batch have made great progress and we look forward to continuing this initiative to fast-track young engineers by equipping them with the skills and experience required to excel in the tech industry. While helping to encourage a culture of learning innovation and progress within the company I also believe that by completing this program our new associates are ready to deliver on our organization’s purpose of connecting the world to share food and care for another.”

(NASDAQ:TMUS) A Quality Stock?,"One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine T-Mobile US Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) by way of a worked example.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

See our latest analysis for T-Mobile US

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for T-Mobile US is:

2.2% = US$1.5b ÷ US$70b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has the company made $0.02 in profit.

Does T-Mobile US Have A Good ROE?

By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly this is far from a perfect measure because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below T-Mobile US has a lower ROE than the average (6.4%) in the Wireless Telecom industry classification.

roe

That certainly isn't ideal. That being said a low ROE is not always a bad thing especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. To know the 4 risks we have identified for T-Mobile US visit our risks dashboard for free.

How Does Debt Impact ROE?

Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings issuing new shares (equity) or debt. In the first and second cases the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case the debt used for growth will improve returns but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.

T-Mobile US' Debt And Its 2.2% ROE

T-Mobile US does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.05. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.

Conclusion

Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal a higher ROE is better.

But when a business is high quality the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.

Of course T-Mobile US may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.

AT&T began the sunset of its 3G network in February followed by Sprint 3G (T-Mobile) on March 31 Sprint LTE (T-Mobile) on June 30 and T-Mobile 3G on July 1. Now Verizon is set to sunset its 3G network on Dec. 31.

Jennifer Coreno product manager for connected devices at Verizon Connect said they are on track to upgrade all impacted Verizon Connect vehicles in the U.S. by the end of the year and are not planning any extensions to the sunset deadline for fleet management customers.

With the deadline looming several telematics providers are working to assist trucking companies in last-minute rushes to make the switch to networks with higher capability including 4G and 5G.

“The ball really does drop on New Year’s Eve” said Tony Nicoletti vice president of business development at DPL Telematics. “Like anything everybody waits to study for the test the night before so people are scrambling last minute to update their devices. It's human nature I think to wait ‘til the last minute.”

Nicoletti said when there’s a sunset there’s a major disruption for everybody but it has been especially challenging this go ‘round because of supply chain disruptions preventing vendors from making upgrades due to lack of things like semiconductors. He said DPL has had several calls with customers recently who are behind on the transition but 90%-plus of its customers have converted to the new network.

For Deseret Transportation Fleet Manager Steven Roberts said the 3G sunset has been almost imperceptible so far.

“We did have to replace the telematics on some our refrigerated trailers. Of course our in-cab telematics have received software updates to be compatible with the 5G but we have not had to replace any units” he said. “We did have a group with telematics from a company that basically would not work with the 5G so we had to switch them to a different provider which required all new hardware.”

Nicoletti said Deseret’s latter situation in which it had to switch to a new provider is one some carriers will have to face if their vendors haven’t been able to upgrade their technology which he said requires a lot of physical labor and extra cost when having to replace hardware in multiple units. The switch he said is having an impact on carriers’ bottom lines if they haven’t built in that capital to make these technological advances. And if they’ve waited until the last minute to handle the transition he said their devices will officially go dark if they haven’t already Dec. 31 further impacting their pocketbooks as it could result in shutting down operations.

Knight-Swift Transportation (CCJ Top 250 No. 5) has stayed on top of the transition. For example the carrier began the process of replacing more than 20000 soon-to-be outdated trailer tracking units for dry van trailers in 2020. Management took the two years ahead of the 3G shutdown to evaluate test and install a 4G-enabled telematics platform ultimately choosing SkyBitz’s Falcon GXT5002C asset tracking solution with integrated cargo sensor and making the switch ahead of schedule despite COVID-19 restrictions and supply chain disruptions.

Siamak Azmoudeh vice president of product lifecycle management and business development at SkyBitz said all of the company’s customers which were primarily running on the AT&T network have made the jump to 4G with very few having a handful of trailers that continue to roam.

SkyBitz was able to negotiate with AT&T to extend its 3G services by allowing customers to roam on the T-Mobil network to give them six additional months for the transition.

“It’s not an easy thing to do especially depending on the size of fleet you have. It's not an easy transition whenever you have to go and replace units” Azmoudeh said. “But I think we've gotten over the hump and I think most customers are where they need to be.”

Thought fleets knew this shutdown was coming many have failed to prepare. He said this network shutdown has opened eyes to the importance of making the transition early but also has taught carriers to give more thought to what technologies they’re buying into.

“I think customers learned during that process and now when they're looking at investing in new technologies they're thinking ‘How long is this going to last for me? Is it something that is going to sunset quickly?’” he said. “I think it was a pretty good eye opener in a way and helps customers understand even more when they're thinking about investing in technology.”

He said the good news is with SkyBitz technology customers will be able to retain their devices for another 15 to 20 years even as additional network expansion comes forth.

Similar to 2G and 3G Nicoletti said the 4G network should be remain online for five to seven years before a full transition to the next spectrum is required. With 4G Nicoletti said networks have built a narrower bandwidth that requires less power and provides greater reach dedicated to telematics and other IoT services so they don’t have to compete with individuals streaming video on their iPhone for example.

Coreno said Verizon Connect customers are already seeing the benefits of that.

Texas-based equipment rental company KRP Rentals and Trucking said as a result of its new 4G LTE devices it is getting faster response times on pinging and getting more accurate data about where its assets are.

“It is important for any remaining 3G fleets to move fast as time is running out until vehicles stop reporting as a result of the 3G sunset” Coreno said.

She said carriers need to discuss with their current fleet management provider to verify which of their vehicles and devices need an upgrade from 3G and determine what the best approach to that switch is. During this process all vehicles should be evaluated – the year make and models associated with 3G devices on their fleet she said. From there 4G hardware recommendations can be made and with Verizon Connect customers can select the installation type that is most convenient for them including self-install options and hidden (behind the dashboard) installations.

“Who keeps a computer or phone for seven years because it becomes obsolete and slow? That being said if you find a vendor that has a product that will last seven years that’s a great vendor. I’d stick with that vendor no matter what” Nicoletti said. “But by the time that seven-year mark rolls around you'll probably be wanting to look to upgrade to whatever the latest and greatest is anyway.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9vbmVwbHVzLW5vcmQtbjMwMC1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OnePlus Nord N300 5G review: A basic phone you can get for free,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9vbmVwbHVzLW5vcmQtbjMwMC1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL29mZmJlYXQvdXMtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtYmFucy1tb2JpbGUtcGhvbmVzLXN0dWRlbnRzLWFyZS1oYXBwaWVyLXRoYW4tZXZlci1yZXBvcnQtMzU3NTY3M9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL29mZmJlYXQvdXMtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtYmFucy1tb2JpbGUtcGhvbmVzLXN0dWRlbnRzLWFyZS1oYXBwaWVyLXRoYW4tZXZlci1yZXBvcnQtMzU3NTY3My9hbXAvMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US High School Bans Mobile Phones Students Are Happier Than Ever: Report,"The ban has improved both academic and social life at the school.

When in-person classes after Covid-19 pandemic began at Buxton School a high school in northwest Massachusetts United States the faculty noted that as the usage of smartphones grew increasingly the sense of community eroded and the students no longer interacted with each other as per a report in the New York Post.

Head of School Peter Beck told the Post that ""the students had completely forgotten the basics of face-to-face interaction"" since they spent a lot of time on their smartphones. He also added that the students faced difficulty conversing with each other and ""their ability to be with or sit with other people was completely gone.""

Noticing all this the faculty of the school decided to implement a ban on smartphones. The institution-wide embargo prohibits both students and faculty and staff from using iPhones and Androids on the 114-acre campus. It went into effect at the start of the academic year this past September and it has been a huge success so far according to the outlet.

Talking to the Post the Head of School said ""The students are thriving. They have adjusted so well to the change."" He said that the change was needed but didn't think that it was actually possible. Mr Beck said that some students were scared hearing the announcement. He continued ""They couldn't imagine what it would be like to not have this device that has become a crucial part of every second of their lives.""

Students who live nearby are required to leave their phones at home while those who are in boarding are required to leave their devices in the school coordinator's office until the end of the semester. However the students are not completely disconnected from the world. The Post informs that each student was given a Light Phone which is a sleek gadget with minimal features. It can make and receive calls and rudimentary texts. As per its website it ""will never have social media clickbait news email an internet browser or any other anxiety-inducing infinite feed.""

It is further informed that students can also use desktop computers to access social media at the end of the school day. The ban has improved both academic and social life at the school.

""They're spending more time doing academic work creatively expressing themselves through art getting to know one another and getting to know themselves"" Mr Beck said.

One faculty member also added that students take permission to go to the washroom much less now. They believe that students usually used the restroom ""to text or check TikTok.""

In November 2022 bolstered by a returning surge of RP streamers GTA V reclaimed the top gaming spot on the platform.

League of Legends has been one of the dominant kings of viewership on Twitch providing tens of millions of hours watched every month for the streaming platform.

But during the month of November arguably one of League of Legends’ weakest months of the year Grand Theft Auto V overtook the MOBA earning itself the second highest viewed category on Twitch (behind Just Chatting).

According to Sullygnome During the month of November 2022 League of Legends had a cumulative watch time of 92.6 million hours while GTA V had a watch time of 99.5 million hours. And per usual Just Chatting won the number one viewed category with a whopping 239.8 million hours of watch time.

A big reason as to exactly how GTA overtook League of Legends is thanks to the recent resurgence of the GTA RP. For those who don’t know exactly what this is it’s essentially an online community of Grand Theft Auto players who enjoy role playing and creating their own rules for the game.

As for League of Legend’s viewership the month of November is typically a testing period for the developers after Worlds ends. Known as preseason the game undergoes a transition into the next season. During this time big streamers such as Tyler1 turn to other games.

Across the rest of the top 10 CS:GO experienced a major boost thanks to the Rio Major. Call of Duty: Warzone also spiked thanks to the release of Warzone 2 while Overwatch 2 started its backwards slide following October’s launch hype.

World of Warcraft crested into the top 10 at the very end too spurred on by Dragonflight’s release.

Here is what Headwaters Capital had to say about Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) was founded in 1999 and provides vulnerability management software to both SMBs and enterprise customers. Vulnerability management software provides a continuous view of security and compliance across all of a company’s assets including on-premise end-points cloud and mobile. The easiest way to think about QLYS’s original VM solution is that it provided a dashboard that monitored all potential threats to a network and helped IT departments prioritize which vulnerabilities were the highest risk. QLYS was a pioneer in the industry as they were one of the first companies to offer a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) solution as opposed to the traditional license offerings that proliferated at the time. While QLYS’ VM software has always provided an industry leading dashboard to monitor weaknesses it provided limited functionality to respond to these vulnerabilities. More recently QLYS has increased the functionality of its software through the rollout of Detection and Response capabilities (VMDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities in late 2021. The cybersecurity space has been marked by a preference of customers for point solution expertise as opposed to a winner take all solution. This market structure is driven by the complex nature of assets that need protection the dynamic nature of security threats and the critical nature of cybersecurity which leads to a customer preference for quality over cost. Historically cybersecurity was best served by firewalls which provided a ring fence around assets that were physically located on a network. Firewalls are increasingly becoming obsolete in the cybersecurity world as the network perimeter has effectively disappeared due to the growing adoption of SaaS solutions and new connected devices that connect to the network from multiple new endpoints. This trend has only accelerated following COVID. As more devices and software tools connect from outside of the traditional firewall perimeter the importance of security monitoring tools such as VM VMDR and XDR has increased. In many ways vulnerability management is the foundation of cybersecurity as it provides the dashboard for monitoring all potential security gaps. QLYS’ software can provide critical data about which assets are exposed to specific threats and can increasingly help IT departments prioritize and remediate these vulnerabilities. Understanding QLYS’s history is important to gaining confidence in QLYS’ ability to maintain revenue growth going forward. QLYS was almost perfectly positioned earlier this decade to take advantage of both the transition in the software market from license to SaaS solutions as well as the cybersecurity trend away from firewalls as devices increasingly moved beyond a physical perimeter. Given the large TAM industry tailwinds and a market leading product QLYS was able to growth revenues at a +20% CAGR from 2012-2018. Even more impressive QLYS was able to accomplish this growth with limited investment in R&D or its sales force. R&D as a percentage of revenues declined from 22% in 2012 to 16% in 2018 while S&M declined from 40% in 2012 to 22% in 2018. Consequently QLYS operates with one of the highest EBITDA margins in the industry at 45%. The ability for QLYS to post such consistent revenue growth despite under-investing in product development and sales is evidence of the strong competitive positioning of QLYS’ software and the critical nature of the product…” (Click here to read more)

Here is what Upslope Capital had to say about CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:

“CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) provides specialized technology and consulting services primarily to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. The U.S. Army is CACI’s single largest customer. This position replaces BWXT in Upslope’s “defense basket” (articulated in Q1 on p. 4). CACI’s business is mostly split across Expertise (providing talent to government agencies – e.g. software engineers) and Technology (design and delivery of specific technology-oriented services and products including for example battlefield hardware). The company offers its services and products in support of both day-to-day agency operations and specific missions. At a high-level CACI reminds me of another Upslope long in an unrelated sector: Silgan Holdings (packaging/dispensing and food can business). Both are truly sleepy value stocks that trade for low doubledigit earnings multiples but have a strong history of steady value creation and free cash flow per share growth. Both the stocks and underlying businesses appear very well-positioned for the uncertain macro (or geopolitical in CACI’s case) environment we’re likely to face in the years ahead. Other notable thesis points for CACI specifically:

Long-term Geopolitical & Other Tailwinds – like other components of Upslope’s defense basket CACI should benefit from an attractive defense spending environment for years to come. CACI should also benefit from IT modernization efforts in U.S. government agencies as well as its strength in cyber/electronic warfare offerings…” (Click here to read the full text)

Dixon says they have recorded an impressive growth of $330.3 million or 76 percent.

The FRCS CEO attributed the considerable increase in revenue to the impressive rebound of the economy with all key sectors showing a resurgence.

He adds the favourable collection is linked to a strong recovery across the major tax streams including the Value Added Tax Income Tax and Customs Taxes.

The Pay as You Earn Tax recorded an increase of $3.4m indicating improvement in the labour market both in the formal and informal sectors Corporate Income Tax surged by $11.3m compared to November 2021 showing growth in business confidence and improvement in the investment environment.

The domestic VAT recorded a growth of $26.1m stemming from increased disposable incomes inward remittances and higher tourism-related spending and increase in trade volume attributed to the $22.7m increase in Import VAT collections.

Dixon says the Departure tax collections have been very symmetrical to tourist arrivals and four months into the 2022-2023 fiscal year they have collected $19.8m while collection for the same period last year stood at $0.3m.

FRCS envisages that the revenue projections for future months will continue in a similar trajectory."

Here's what it's all about and why it matters so much as it hits the road in real use for the first time.

Tesla

Like a bullet

The Tesla Semi looks ""more like a bullet than a barn wall"" as the company says. Aero styling is nothing new in the big rig business but the Semi looks more like the futuristic Shell Starship than like anything on the road today.

The Shell Starship 2.0 shares a lot of cues with the Tesla but also imagines a radically different trailer where the Tesla Semi is optimized for existing trailers as it hits the market. Shell

The wheels though are remarkably ordinary. I suspect there's a regulation at play there.

More a pilot than a driver

The driver's seat is centered not offset as in conventional cars and trucks giving the driver evenly good vision on both sides and a view ahead that seems almost as if one is atop the sloped hood of the truck not behind it. Dual 15-inch screens on either side of the wheel replace the usual forest of gauges and controls save for a couple of federally mandated safety buttons. The cab is tall enough to stand up in. No mention of a software-defined CB radio.

The centered driver seat is reminiscent of the McLaren F1; Tesla says the truck has sufficiently improved driving dynamics to warrant such a parallel. Tesla

500 miles on a charge

Tesla has made a 500-mile run in the Semi on a single charge of its 900 kWh battery which would represent the top version of the truck expected to sell at between $180000 and $200000. A key unknown is how much the Tesla Semi itself weighs which must be subtracted from the maximum 82000 pound gross weight of truck and trailer to get the total payload the Semi can pull. Every pound the Semi weighs more than a typical diesel rig is one less pound an operator can transport fully loaded. A presumed $150000 model with a lighter battery might deliver only 300 miles but carry more payload; maxiumum range is viewed differently by the trucking industry than by the average EV driver. For comparison Volvo's electric VNR delivers 275 miles Freightliner's eCascadia offers 230 miles and the Nikola TRE boasts 330 miles of range.

Five hundred miles dovetails pretty nicely with the time at which drivers are mandated to take a 30-minute break after 8 hours of driving creating a natural time to charge. A 70% charge is said to take 30 minutes not far behind today's best cars but it won't happen at your local Supercharger.

Megachargers will be laid out for trucks and deliver far more power to their huge batteries. They will also typically encompass large battery arrays to store renewable power for later use further bringing down the operational cost of the Semi. Tesla

Meet the Megacharger

Tesla Megachargers are a new kind of charging depot with more space more voltage and more battery storage to charge big truck batteries renewably while cushioning the load on the local power grid. Prototype Semis have been seen charging at Superchargers by connecting several charge cables to the truck at once but that seems like a development workaround rather than a go-to market suggestion. I thought I heard wrong when Elon Musk said Megachargers would be able to deliver a megawatt of power four times the power delivery of the most potent Superchargers installed today but it makes sense given the truck's presumed battery capacity.

3 motors but only sometimes

That juice feeds three motors only one of which is used when cruising while the other two ganged on one of the axles kick in only when acceleration is needed. Each motor is the same patented type as those in the Tesla Plaid models. You may laugh at 0-to-60 time of 20 seconds but that's impressive from a truck that weighs 17 times a Model S Plaid and is aimed at efficiency not performance.

The Semi has three motors borrowed from the Model S Plaid but needs just one of them to cruise at a steady pace. Tesla

A Tesla clip of its truck blowing by a traditional rig on an uphill grade like it's tied to a post is a far cry from the usual truck crawling up a grade in the slow lane. And Tesla says the Semi's motors develop such stout regen that the truck can get to the bottom of a long grade and still have cool brakes.

A safer rig

Tesla is known for its ambitious if overhyped Autopilot and Full Self Driving but each of those overlapping driver assistance technologies will find a better home in the Semi than in personal cars because professional drivers simply pay more attention to driving and the ability of their vehicle. Commercial drivers are also subject to vastly deeper training than the rest of us who have a basic driver's license suggesting they would learn to really exploit Tesla's driver assistance while not overtrusting it. Tesla has yet to detail the driver assistance technologies that will be available on the Semi and how they'll differ from that on their cars.

As Pepsi and FritoLay break in the first few examples of the Semi the wins they're looking for are several:

According to Tesla conventional big rigs are few but vastly over-index on pollution. Tesla

Big rigs are just 1% of the vehicles on US roads but account for 20% of vehicle emissions and 36% of all particulate emission according to Tesla.

A less-known $40000 federal tax credit is newly available for large electric trucks with fewer strings attached than with the $7500 light vehicle credit.

Tesla has a form of pixie dust similar to Apple's: It validates sectors by entering them making the Semi more than just a product launch and something of a category legitimization. That won't happen immediately however as Tesla probably won't achieve volume manufacturing of the Semi until a new assembly line in Texas is completed and starts working at full tilt in a year or so. In the process more technical specs confirmed pricing and maybe even a few unpleasant surprises will become known.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMDQvYWxlZi1hZXJvbmF1dGljcy1zdGFydHVwLWJhY2tlZC1ieS10ZXNsYS1pbnZlc3Rvci1mbHlpbmctY2FyLWJ5LTIwMjUuaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzEyLzA0L2FsZWYtYWVyb25hdXRpY3Mtc3RhcnR1cC1iYWNrZWQtYnktdGVzbGEtaW52ZXN0b3ItZmx5aW5nLWNhci1ieS0yMDI1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Startup backed by Tesla investor promises $300000 flying car by 2025: 'This is not more complicated than a Toyota Corolla',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMDQvYWxlZi1hZXJvbmF1dGljcy1zdGFydHVwLWJhY2tlZC1ieS10ZXNsYS1pbnZlc3Rvci1mbHlpbmctY2FyLWJ5LTIwMjUuaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzEyLzA0L2FsZWYtYWVyb25hdXRpY3Mtc3RhcnR1cC1iYWNrZWQtYnktdGVzbGEtaW52ZXN0b3ItZmx5aW5nLWNhci1ieS0yMDI1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C490E2D210>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Faculty members say many companies are either staying off the campus or making very few offers. Older IITs like Bombay Kanpur Madras Guwahati and Roorkee said while pay packages being offered are more or less the same the number of overall recruitments in particular by the Information Technology (IT) sector companies has been slightly low. The first phase started on December 1 and will go on till December 15.

“On the first day of placements we had 46 companies interviewing candidates either online or in-person. Of the 250 job offers on Day 1 more than 175 were accepted. Besides 300 pre-placement offers (PPO) were received of which 194 were accepted. While salary packages have remained largely unchanged tech giants have either been very selective or have not visited the campus this year” said an IIT-Bombay spokesperson.

Some companies that have recruited are Accenture Solutions Airbus India Microsoft India Morgan Stanley McKinsey Procter & Gamble Qualcomm Shell India Texas Instruments and Tata Steel among others the spokesperson added.

“Placements are going on well but not as good as past few years. Some of the IT companies cancelled at the last moment while there were some that registered and took the initial test but backed out last minute or hired very few. International offers were even lesser. It is mostly the start-ups that made good offers” a professor at IIT-Kanpur said who did not wish to be named.

Final year students at IIT-Roorkee received 500 offers (some of the results are still awaited) by a total of 63 companies in two days of placements till 2pm on Friday of which six were international offers.

“Overall the placements have been fine but of course there is an impact of the global economic situation in the IT sector. The market is volatile. The overall recruitment numbers have reduced than past few years even as there has been diversification of profiles. Many of the big tech companies have not turned up or remained too selective in their approach. They are just being cautious given the scenario but students are ready to face the challenges” said Kaushik Pal professor in-Charge (placements) IIT-Roorkee.

The highest offer bagged was of Rs 1.3 crore made by a domestic company while about Rs 1 crore offer was made by international companies said Pal.

Despite the slight dip in international offers IIT-Madras and IIT-Guwahati saw a jump in the number of offers made by domestic companies with the latter bagging the highest international offer of Rs 2.04 crore on day one of the placements by two students while highest domestic offers was of Rs 1.1 crore.

At Guwahati the big recruiters of this year’s first two sessions include Microsoft Google Uber Qualcomm Enphase Energy Oracle Nutanix Thoughtspot MTS-2 Texas Instruments American Express and JP Morgan.

“Initially the big giants for instance Microsoft said they would not participate in the placement sessions as many of these had already given PPOs but it was only last week that they registered. International offers were slightly fewer than last year yet the pay package offered was highest so far this season. Most of the offers this time were national” said Abhishek Kumar head centre for career placements at IIT-Guwahati.

Santosh Gudlavalleti a final-year electrical engineering student at IIT-Madras who coordinates non-core placements at the institute said there were recession fears among companies that made them slightly hesitant of hiring but the overall placement scenario was decent. The international offers went up to around Rs 1.8 crore while the highest domestic offer made is of Rs 1.6 crore.

“There were a few companies for instance Zomato which gave PPOs but didn’t turn up for the placement sessions. Still a number of other companies including those based in Europe US and Japan came in such as Maverick Da Vinci Microsoft and Google among others” he said.

Most institutes said Amazon which saw massive layoffs this year did not come for placements this season. The second-generation IITs whose placements cycle is not in sync with the older IITs maintain that they will be able to share data only after a week or so of the placements.

“We can share precise numbers only around December 12-13. But with the current job offers we have seen an increase in all the parameters namely number of offers pay packages PPOs etc. Due to recession we have observed less participation from the start-ups particularly” said prof Tushar Jain faculty advisor career and placement cell IIT-Mandi.

Karen Nelson is a Jamaican-born pioneer in the field of the human microbiome and the author/co-author of over 220 peer-reviewed publications. She has a B.Sc. in agriculture and animal science from the University of the West Indies an M.Sc. in animal science from the University of Florida and earned her Ph.D. in animal science and microbiology from Cornell University. Prior to joining Thermo Fisher in 2021 Nelson worked for some years with the nonprofit J. Craig Venter Institute and was its president from 2012 to 2021.

She was born in Jamaica where her interest in nature began when she was very young. She had planned to become a veterinarian but once she took human and animal nutrition classes in college she became enamored of microbiology. Her interests brought her to study ruminant microbiology at Cornell and she learned that an animal’s native microbial populations could be critical to its health and well-being. She became a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Genomic Research in 1996 researching archaea. At the Institute she was noted for her research on Thermotoga maritima. Since then she has advanced in her profession to become a leader in microbial and metagenomics research. Nelson shared that she is interested in microbes because these “simple” organisms are actually much more complicated than originally thought.

Nelson is experienced in microbial ecology microbial genomics microbial physiology and metagenomics. She has headed numerous efforts in genomics and metagenomics and led the first human metagenomics study which was published in 2006. Nelson has edited three books and serves as editor-in-chief of the Microbial Ecology journal and PNAS Nexus a journal from the National Academy of Sciences. She was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences and is an American Academy of Microbiology Fellow. Nelson is also an honorary professor at the University of the West Indies and a Helmholtz International Fellow.

In vitro studies have elucidated several cellular mechanisms driven by complex epigenetic and genetic changes to escape antitumor toxicities. Mechanisms of platinum resistance include but not limited to reduced accumulation of drugs due to impaired influx or potent efflux/secretion mechanisms accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and simultaneous detoxification by antioxidants elevated levels of DNA damage repair mechanisms changes in membrane protein trafficking aberrant protein and gene expressions altering drug transport and uptake as well as pathways such as those hindering apoptosis and inducing EMT in response to chemotherapy treatment in surviving cells [29]. Platinum resistance has become the focus of cancer therapeutic development in recent years although no effective management has been shown to circumvent this phenomenon in resistant/refractory ovarian cancer patients. In this study we sought to explore the proteome of ovarian cancer cell lines the carboplatin sensitive OVCAR5 cells and their resistant counterparts to identify proteins associated with carboplatin resistance and the associated functional consequences that may explain the resistance phenotype. We report an upregulation of several novel EMT modulators in the carboplatin-resistant cells including G6PD AKR1B1 ITGAV ITGA2 ITGA1 FLNA GFPT2 and TGFBI. Functional analyses in vitro showed low proliferation and enhanced migratory features in the carboplatin-resistance cells compared to parental chemo naïve cell line. An enhanced expression of EMT and metabolism regulators including G6PD and AKR1B1 and TGFβ1 observed in vitro in carboplatin resistant cell line was confirmed in platinum resistant and relapsed human ovarian tumor samples compared to chemo naïve human tumors. In short carboplatin-resistant cells acquired a plastic phenotype and were less proliferative and more migratory. These slow-cycling resistant cells expressed drug resistance and CSC markers (ABCG2 CD44 CD105) and exhibited a low OXPHOS-glycolysis signature.

During cancer progression tumor cells procure migratory feature imitating the phenotypic characteristics of EMT that occurs during embryogenesis and wound healing [30]. This feature of EMT is widely recognized as the central component of disseminated cancer cells that form distant metastasis [31]. Various mechanisms of enhanced migration in EMT-transformed cells have been elucidated among those widely recognized is the loss of epithelial junction protein E-cadherin (CDH1) and replacement by other cadherins and intermediate filament protein vimentin (VIM) which facilitate mesenchymal transformation for single cell or collective migration [32]. In this study we demonstrate decreased expression of E-cadherin and enhanced expression of vimentin consistent with enhanced migration in CBPR OVCAR5 compared to their parental OVCAR5 cell line.

Our study also demonstrates reduced bioenergenetics in EMT transformed CBPR OVCAR5 cells consistent with reduced proliferation in the resistant cell line compared to parental OVCAR5 cells. The link between EMT and reduced proliferation has been observed in many cellular model systems. Importantly reduced proliferation in EMT-transformed disseminating cells at the invading margins of tumors has been noted. This presumably occurs to facilitate the re-establishment of migrating cells in their secondary niches to promote secondary growth and is enabled by the overexpression of cell cycle related cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16(INK4a) p21(Cip1) or p27(Kip1) [33]. These observations are consistent with EMT programs described in cells under conditions that are not permissive for cellular growth such as hypoxia and anoikis [34 35]. It is also coherent with previous observations in chemotherapy surviving EMT transformed residual cells which had decreased bioenergetic demands potentially to reduce their susceptibility to hostile cytotoxic microenvironment to enhance sustenance after therapeutic treatment [4]. Moreover clinicopathological studies have demonstrated reduced proliferation in EMT-transformed circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and disseminated tumor cells during and after chemotherapy treatment [36]. In fact slow-cycling phenotype in cancer cells has been recognized as a core mechanism for therapy resistance [37 38]. Isolated populations of slow-growing label-retaining colon cancer and breast cancer cells had enhanced survival when exposed to a third-generation platinum derivative oxaliplatin compared to non-labelled cells [38].

Altered expression of ECM components and integrins have been widely documented in EMT-induced cancer cells preceding and through the metastatic process [39]. In ovarian cancer the expression of several integrin complexes including αvβ1 which binds fibronectin and integrins α1β1 and α2β1 which interact with collagen have been shown to contribute to cancer progression and chemoresistance [40]. Enhanced expression of ITGAV (αv subunit) ITGA1 (α1 subunit) and ITGA2 (α2 subunit) in OVCAR5 CBPR cells is indicative of ECM changes consistent with enhanced production of fibronectin and collagen observed in several malignancies and in most EMT-induced cancer models [41]. In addition enhanced expression of filamin A (FLNA) may relate to cytoskeleton actin and tubulin reorganization as seen in different cancer models undergoing EMT [42].

In ovarian cancer TGFβ1 induction has been shown to be a hallmark of EMT [43]. Cancer cells subjected to TGFβ1 treatment was found to become more motile and invasive [44]. TGFBI an ECM protein with multiple functions in ovarian cancer is up regulated by TGFβ signaling pathway. Loss of TGFBI expression in HGSOC has been noted [19]. This occurs due to promoter hypermethylation of TGFBI promoter resulting in the silencing of the gene expression [19]. This promoter hypermethylation of TGFBI correlates with paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer [45]. In the same context paclitaxel-resistant cells when treated with recombinant TGFBI protein showed increased paclitaxel sensitivity due to FAK-Rho dependent stabilization of microtubules [46]. These findings suggest that TGFBI plays an important role in chemoresistance. We thus investigated the expression of TGFβ1 and downstream targets following our observation of TGFBI overexpression in the mass spectrometry analysis of OVCAR5 CBPR cells. Enhanced expression of TGFβ1 protein as seen in our western blot analysis compliments the increased mRNA expression of TGFBI in OVCAR5 CBPR cells suggesting an enhanced expression and functional activation of TGFβ1 in these cells. This is consistent with microarray studies that demonstrated significantly high expression of TGFBI in methotrexate cisplatin doxorubicin vincristine topotecan and paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and reconciled those findings to changes in ECM remodeling in response to drug treatment [47].

Our proteomics findings and subsequent validation also demonstrated an enhanced expression of the ITGAV ITGA1 and ITGA2 in OVCAR5 CBPR versus parental OVCAR5 cell lines. ITGAV expression has been shown to positively correlate with the molecular signature of mesenchymal cells and metastasis of cancer cells [7]. At the same token TGFβ driven gemcitabine resistance and upregulated expression of ITGA1 has been noted in pancreatic ductal cell carcinoma which promoted EMT and metastasis [48]. Similarly overexpression of ITGA2 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines promoted EMT and metastasis through FAK/AKT pathway [49] and also showed chemotherapy resistance in gastric cancer while ITGA2 knockdown restored chemosensitivity by inducing apoptosis in chemoresistant cells [50]. These observations indicate a collective role of TGFBI ITGAV ITGA1 and ITGA2 in EMT-induced metastasis and chemotherapy resistance.

AKR1B1 also functions as a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of glucose in the polyol pathway [51]. AKR1B1 overexpression has been shown to strongly correlate with the molecular profile of mesenchymal-like cells in various cancer models [52]. In lung cancer high expression of AKR1B1 resulted in enhanced glutathione (GSH) synthesis and resistance to EGFR inhibitors in cell lines and xenograft models [51]. Whether the same aspect of AKR1B1 exists in OVCAR5 CBPR cells remains to be evaluated. We also report for the first-time an association of GFPT2 with chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer. GFPT2 has been associated with enhanced glycosylation of proteins concomitant with mesenchymal functions and morphology and is regulated by GSH [53]. GFPT2 has been reported to initiate EMT in serous ovarian cancer by activating the hexosamine synthetic pathway to enhance the nuclear localization of β-catenin [54]. These observations suggest that both AKR1B1 and GFPT2 may work in conjunction to sustain the levels of GSH in CBPR OVCAR5 cells for their sustenance against the ROS insult triggered by platinum treatment.

Our proteomics data also revealed expression of G6PD to be higher in the OVCAR5 CBPR cells and this was consistent in platinum-resistant human ovarian tumors compared to their chemo-sensitive counterparts. This enzyme drives the first step of pentose phosphate pathway and converts glucose to ribose-5-phosphate required for nucleotide synthesis. This is consistent with the upregulation of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT1) an enzyme critical for the maintenance of purine salvage pathway. The upregulation of these rate-limiting enzymes could divert glucose metabolism through glycolysis towards pentose phosphate pathway and purine salvage pathways which may explain the reduction of the glycolytic pathway in the OVCAR5 CBPR cells. Whilst not investigated in this study pentose phosphate pathway also produces NADPH which is central to the detoxification of ROS. The survival benefit of G6PD overexpression is exemplified in G6PD-deficient mice with high levels of oxidative damage in the brain [55]. Like other platinum antineoplastic drugs carboplatin induces ROS production upon DNA binding. In resistant cancer cells elevated expression of G6PD AKR1B1 and GFPT2 counteracts the effects of ROS production as a prerequisite for cell survival and therapy resistance [56]. A recent study utilizing ovarian cancer patient-derived spheroids also reported significant association between cisplatin resistance elevated levels of G6PD and enhanced level of GSH-producing enzymes in resistant cells [57]. These observations suggest the importance of chemotherapy-induced ECM remodeling (potentially through TGFBI) and ROS counteracting measures for the survival of chemotherapy stressed cancer cells.

Using multi-omic and bioenergetics analyses a recent study demonstrated that high-OXPHOS ovarian cancer cells with higher ROS content exhibited greater sensitivity to taxane and platinum treatment compared to low-OXPHOS cells [58]. Given the pharmacological role of platinum compounds in initiating ROS production tumor metabolic reprogramming to survive under therapy-induced oxidative stress is anticipated. This can be achieved by reducing intracellular ROS production through low levels of mitochondrial respiration elevated dependency on glycolytic phenotype or enhanced capacity of antioxidant detoxification [58 59]. Our profiling of cellular bioenergetics using Seahorse extracellular flux assay revealed that the carboplatin-resistant cells have a low-OXPHOS low-glycolysis phenotype. The low metabolism and activated pathways responsible for ROS scavenging likely work in synergy to confer resistance to carboplatin-induced oxidative stress. The carboplatin resistant OVCAR5 cells also possess the ability to switch between glycolysis and OXPHOS which indicates plasticity to adapt to metabolic stresses. In addition they exhibited a lower rate of other non-glycolytic means of ATP generation such as the TCA cycle and/or glycogenolysis. The slower rate of cell growth but higher migratory capacity of the less metabolically active OVCAR5 CBPR cells may suggest that these cells undergo migration at the expense of proliferation. The downregulation of PCK2 (required for the conversion of oxaloacetate to pyruvate that feeds into the anabolic gluconeogenic pathway) and ACACA (a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo fatty acid synthesis that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA) in OVCAR5 CBPR cells may also indicate a lack of dependency of these cells on anabolic gluconeogenic and fatty acid synthesis pathways. Further work needs to be done to investigate if these cells get metabolically ‘switched-on’ to support migration and reduced proliferation as reported in other slow-cycling cells.

The expression levels of carboplatin resistance-associated proteins AKR1B1 ITGAV TGFβ1 and G6PD in platinum resistant and relapsed human ovarian cancer samples are consistent with our observations in vitro data on control and carboplatin-resistant cells. However no prognostic role of AKRIBI ITGAV and G6PD was evident in TCGA data and GSE (from Gene Expression Omnibus) datasets which included 738 high grade ovarian cancer patients that had undergone chemotherapy treatments. High expression of TGFBI GFPT2 FLNA and ITGA2 on the other hand were bad prognostic indicators in this patient cohort. Interestingly the positive expression profiling of TGFBI with important ECM remodeling proteins such as GFPT2 FLNA G6PD ITGAV ITGA1 and ITGA2 shown by TIMER datasets suggest a potential role of these proteins in remodeling ECM in response to carboplatin treatment. Consistent with our findings a recent study has shown increased migratory amino acid metabolism protein catabolism and IFN1 signaling perturbation in platinum resistant ovarian cancer cell lines [60].

EMT in cancer cells has been associated with mitigating the immune system escape mechanisms in host [61]. In breast cancer induction of EMT by overexpression of transcription factor SNAIL can render breast cancer cells resistant to the cytotoxic effect of CD8+T cells through the induction of autophagy; and targeting an autophagy inducer (BECN1) restored CD8+T mediated tumor cell lysis [62]. A recent pan cancer study indicated TGFBI as a prognostic marker in various cancers due to its involvement in various immune responses [63]. This is consistent with our analysis which showed a statistically significant positive association of infiltration of CD8+ T cells CD4+ T cells macrophages neutrophils and dendritic cells with TGFB1 expression. In addition the enhanced expression of FLNA and ITGAV significantly associated with CD8+T cells macrophages and dendritic cells. Infiltration of dendritic cells was positively regulated by all the genes except FLNA. As most of the ECM components in the study facilitated the infiltration of dendritic cells may indicate essential role of remodeled ECM components in facilitating dendritic cell function which contributes in a significant way to antitumor response. However approaches to use immunotherapy have not shown success in primary HGSOC or platinum resistant HGSOC patients [64 65]. Potential reasons for the lack of immunotherapy response in HGSOC patients may include abundance of immunosuppressive factors in ovarian TME such as infiltration of a variety of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and Tregs. In addition immunoregulatory enzymes (arginase COX2 INOS) and immunosuppressive substances produced by these cells such as IL-10 TGFβ vascular endothelial growth factor PGE2 or PD-L1 inhibit innate and adaptive immunities and dendritic cell maturation. In addition increased expression of checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-L1 CD47 CD73 in chemo naïve ovarian cancer cells and chemotherapy treated ovarian cancer cells have been noted [66 67]. In addition the density of intraepithelial CD8+T cells was shown to inversely correlate with the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells suggesting that the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells may result in the exclusion of CD8 + T-cell in the tumors [66]. Some of these factors may indicate limited activity of immune check point inhibitors in treating chemonaive and platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients [65].

In summary this study demonstrates that carboplatin-resistant cells acquired an EMT phenotype which was less proliferative but more migratory. Altered expression of metabolic proteins also suggest a potential metabolic switch towards pentose phosphate pathway polyol and hexosamine biosynthesis and purine salvage pathways with less dependency on anabolic gluconeogenesis and fatty acid biosynthesis. Enhanced expression of AKR1B1 GFPT2 and G6PD may sustain adequate level of GSH crucial for the survival of platinum—treated EMT transformed cells. On the other hand upregulation of TGFBI in conjunction with ECM related proteins such as ITGAV ITGA1 ITGA2 FLNA etc. may facilitate ECM remodeling advantageous for chemoresistance and sustenance in the EMT transformed TME. Taken together our findings provide molecular and functional evidence of EMT altered metabolic and redox metabolism which supports carboplatin chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. The findings of this study have been depicted in Fig. 13.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjaG9saXZlLmllL2NvcmtuZXdzL2FyaWQtNDEwMjA5MjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dozens of Cork charities and groups to benefit from company's partnership grant,"TWENTY-SEVEN charities and community groups in Cork’s Lower Harbour and beyond have been announced as the recipients of Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Community Partnership Grant.

The Global life sciences company has announced the organisations who will share the €40000 fund this year.

Now in its third year among the deserving local groups are Irish Community Air Ambulance Down Syndrome Centre Cork and UCC’s WiSTEM Society.

“For the third year running we have been blown away by the generosity passion and strong sense of community in the Lower Harbour and we are proud to support them through this funding” Caroline Barry operational excellence lead at Thermo Fisher’s campus in Currabinny said.

“This year’s inspiring recipients for our €40000 Community Partnership Grant share our mission to make the world healthier cleaner and safer.

“From Tidy Towns groups keeping their local areas clean to charities and groups providing vital services to enhance the health and well-being across all sectors of society we are heartened by the knowledge that this year’s grant will be put to use by a myriad of worthy inspiring causes” she continued.

Commenting on what the funding means to the organisation Irish Community Air Ambulance CEO Micheál Sheridan said that funding like the Thermo Fisher Community Partnership Grant is “vital” to maintaining core services at the charity-run organisation.

“This money will be directed to help the running of our Air Ambulance which responds to over 500 emergency calls a year and costs up to €1.5million a year to run.

“We also currently have a team of eight Emergency Medical Responders on-the-ground Volunteer Doctors who respond to an average of 600 emergency calls in rural and hard-to-reach communities across the country each year.

“With funding we are able to provide them with specialised vehicles and medical equipment to be able to respond in local communities” Mr Sheridan continued.

This year he said the Irish Community Air Ambulance has seen a 70 percent increase in fuel costs for its helicopter and that increased pressure on emergency services nationwide has increased demands on the Irish Community Air Ambulance’s services.

“It is more important than ever that we have the funds we need to ensure people in distress get the help they need when they need it” he said.

Other groups to benefit from the fund include Carrigaline Educate Together National School Cork Deaf Association and Shanbally Tidy Towns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zNTE4MC140gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retrotransposon instability dominates the acquired mutation landscape of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells,"Ethics statement

All animal experimentation was performed under the auspices and approval of the Monash University Animal Research Platform Animal Ethics Committee (Approval Numbers MARP-2011-172-Polo MARP-2011-171-BC-Polo MARP-2017-151-BC-Polo and ERM# 21634).

Adult Oct4GFP-OKSM-M2rtTA mouse tissue somatic cell isolation and reprogramming

Induced pluripotent stem cells were generated from adult (females aged 39–57 days) and embryonic (E13.5) Oct4GFP-OKSM-M2rtTA doxycycline inducible reprogrammable mice53. These animals are heterozygous for an Oct4-GFP reporter and an OKSM cassette targeted to the Collagen1α1 locus and homozygous for the ROSA26-M2rtTA allele from the ubiquitous ROSA26 locus. The polycistronic cassette is under the control of a tetracycline-dependent promoter (tetOP). Hence upon the addition of doxycycline M2rtTA binds to the tetOP thereby inducing OKSM expression. Oct4GFP-OKSM-M2rtTA mice were housed at the Monash University Animal Research Platform animal facility. Animals were kept under standard housing conditions with a 12/12 h dark/light cycle ambient room temperature of 18–24 °C and 40–70% humidity.

Liver epithelial cells were isolated according to an adaptation of a previously described method98. Briefly 3 mg/mL Collagenase Type 1 (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#: C1639) solution was prepared in sterile PBS. Whole liver was transferred into a sterile 6 cm petri dish and finely minced using fine dissecting scissors. Minced liver pieces were transferred to 15 mL tube with preheated Collagenase Type 1 (Sigma Cat#: C1639). Tubes were left to agitate on a Thermomix (Eppendorf) at 750 rpm 37 °C for 15 min. Following digestion the tube was removed and the cellular suspension was triturated with an 18 G needle until tissue chunks were mostly dissociated. Sample tubes were then left to agitate for an additional 15 min until liver fragments were completely digested. The sample suspension was again triturated with a 21 G needle to generate a single cell suspension and then processed through a 40 µm cell strainer into a clean 50 mL centrifuge tube (Corning).

Reprogrammable mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cultures were derived as described previously102 from a E13.5dpc Oct4GFP-OKSM-M2rtTA embryo (animal I222e2) and cultivated at 37 °C 5% O 2  5% CO 2 in MEF medium containing DMEM High Glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 11960-044) with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: SH30071.03) 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 11360-070) GlutaMAX Supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 35050061) Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 15070063) MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 11140050) and 2-Mercaptoethanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 21985023). MEFs were reprogrammed by being placed in iPSC medium supplemented with 2 µg/mL dox (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#: 33429-100MG-R) and cultured on irradiated MEFs at 37 °C 5% CO 2 . iPSC colonies were discerned according to GFP expression in the absence of dox. In addition to bulk iPSC cultures (see below) single Oct4-GFP+ cells were deposited via FACS individually into 96-well pre-gelatinized tissue culture plates (Falcon Cat#: 353072). Eighteen single-cell clones were bulk expanded on 6-well pre-gelatinized tissue culture plates (Falcon Cat#: 353046) and maintained in serum or 2i conditions (see below).

Oct4-GFP+ iPSC flow cytometry

For flow cytometry cells were harvested by dissociating in 0.25% Trypsin EDTA (Life Technologies) to yield a single cell suspension and then resuspended in FACS wash (Phosphate Buffered Saline with 2% Fetal Calf Serum) containing PI. Live cells were gated on the basis of forward scatter side scatter and PI exclusion. Flow cytometric gates were set using control iPSCs that did not have endogenous GFP expression. Tubes were sorted according to GFP expression using an Influx Cell Sorter Instrument (Becton Dickinson). Data collected were analyzed and presented using FlowJo software version 10.8.1. Sorted GFP+ cells were then plated down on T-25 flasks (Corning) and expanded onto T-150 flasks (Corning) before being frozen down at a density of 1 × 106 cells/vial.

Serum/LIF and 2i/LIF serum-free iPSC culture

Mouse iPSCs were maintained on irradiated primary MEFs as previously described8103. Briefly iPSCs were cultured on 0.2% Porcine Gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#: G1890-500G) coated tissue culture plates and flasks (Corning) on a feeder layer of irradiated MEFs (2 × 104 cells/cm2). iPSC medium was changed daily and cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Passaging was performed when iPSCs reached 70% confluency. Alternatively iPSCs were cultured on irradiated MEFs in serum-free media containing knockout serum replacement (KOSR) and 2i/LIF104. Here cells were cultured in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 11960-044) 1000 U/mL LIF (Merck Millipore Cat#: ESG1107) 0.1 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 21985023) 1 mM GlutaMAX Supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 35050061) 1% Sodium Pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 11360-070) 0.1 mM MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 11140050) 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 15070063) with medium supplemented with 15% KOSR (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 10828-028) 1 µm Mek1/2 Inhibitor (PD0325901) (Tocris Cat#: 4192) and 3 µm GSK3a/b inhibitor (CHIR99021) (Tocris Cat#: 4423). Prior to genomic DNA extraction iPSCs depleted from irradiated feeders were dissociated with 0.5% Trypsin EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 25200-072). The irradiated MEFs were feeder depleted with 10 mL of iPSC media for 45 min in non-gelatinized T-25 flasks (Corning Cat#: CLS3056). The resultant iPSCs were collected as a supernatant in a suspension medium.

Lamivudine titration experiments

iPSCs were cultured with primary irradiated MEFs as above for 9 days in concentrations of lamivudine (3TC Sigma-Aldrich Cat#: L1295-10MG) ranging from 0 to 200 µM and cell survival calculated as a % of the starting population. Reprogrammable OKSM rtTA3 MEFs were isolated from embryonic day 13.5 embryos from Oct4-GFP;ROSA-rtTA-out;OKSM-72 mice as previously described44105. Doxycycline inducible reprogrammable MEFs were grown in media containing 2 µg/mL dox (Sigma Aldrich Cat#: 33429-100MG-R) and 0-200 µM 3TC for 15 days with the percentage cell survival calculated at days 3 7 10 and 15. Once 100 µM was identified as the optimal concentration of 3TC to assess its impact on L1 retrotransposition 30000 reprogrammable MEFs at passage 2 were seeded onto gelatinized 6-well plates and reprogrammed in dox for 12 days then cultured for an additional 4 days without dox. Oct4-GFP+ iPSCs were then purified via flow cytometric sorting and expanded on irradiated MEFs for an additional 11 days then feeder depleted prior to DNA extraction for ONT sequencing. Reprogramming and iPSC media contained serum and either 100 µM 3TC or no 3TC.

Illumina sequencing and genomic analysis

Genomic DNA was harvested from MEFs and iPSCs using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Cat#: 60594). DNA was quantified by a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies Cat#: Q32851) on a Qubit Fluorometer 3.0 (Life Technologies). For WGS libraries were generated using an Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-free kit (Illumina Cat#: 20015962) and sequenced separately on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform (Macrogen Korea).

For mRC-seq libraries were prepared as follows: 1 μg genomic DNA was sheared using a Covaris M220 Focused Ultrasonicator in a 130 μL microTUBE AFA fiber snap-cap vial (Covaris Cat#: 520045). The following parameters were used to gain 500 bp insert libraries: 50 W duty factor 20% 200 cycles per burst duration 55 s. Size selection to remove fragments <300 bp was performed using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Cat#: A63881) with a 1:0.6 DNA:beads ratio. Libraries were then generated by TruSeq Nano DNA LT kit (Illumina Cat#: 20015964) using TruSeq DNA Single Indexes (Illumina Cat#: 20015960 and 20015961) and run on a 2% agarose gel (Bioline Cat#: BIO-41025) pre-stained with SYBR Safe Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Invitrogen Cat#: S33102). For ~500 bp insert size libraries the target gel fragment size was 600–650 bp which was excised under a Safe Imager 2.0 Blue-Light Transilluminator (Invitrogen). DNA was purified using a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Cat#: 28606) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was eluted in 25 μL molecular grade water. Enrichment of DNA fragments was performed as described for Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA LT Kit (Illumina Cat#: 20015964). Sample clean up was performed with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Cat#: A63881) using a 1:1.1 ratio of DNA to beads. Amplified libraries were eluted in 30 μL molecular grade water and quantified using a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent Technologies Cat#: 5067-1504).

mRC-seq hybridization was performed as previously described28. Hybridization reactions were washed using SeqCap Hybridization and Wash Kit (Roche Cat#: 05634261001) and DNA eluted in 50 μL molecular grade water. Two post-hybridization LM-PCR reactions per sample were performed using 20 μL Enhanced PCR Mix 5 μL PCR Primer Cocktail from the Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA LT Kit (Illumina Cat#: 20015964) and 25 μL sample. PCR was performed with the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 3 min 8 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s 60 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 30 s followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The two PCR reactions for each sample were pooled and cleaned up using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and samples eluted in 15 μL Elution Buffer (Qiagen Cat#: 28706). Quantity and fragment size were determined using a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent Technologies Cat#: 5067-1504). Libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform (Macrogen Korea).

Reads were aligned to the mm10 reference genome using bwa-mem106 version 0.7.12 with parameters -M -Y. Duplicate reads were marked via Picard MarkDuplicates version 1.128. Indel Realignment was carried out via GATK IndelRealigner (3.7). SNVs were called by GATK HaplotypeCaller 3.754 to generate GVCFs and GenotypeGVCFs to obtain cohort-level calls. SNVs were also called using freebayes55 filtered to remove known mouse strain germline variants56. SVs were called using Delly2 (version 0.7.9) and GRIDSS 2.0.05758 using calls with concordant non-filtered precise breakends. SNVs and SVs including potential private variants were genotyped using the full catalog of variants obtained from all samples including MEFs. Variant impact prediction and annotation was carried out using SnpEff version 4.3T107. WGS and mRC-seq aligned BAMs were processed to identify non-reference TE insertions using TEBreak60 (https://github.com/adamewing/tebreak) version 1.1 as previously described61.

TE insertion PCR validation experiments

Reads supporting putative de novo TE insertions were manually examined using Serial Cloner (http://serialbasics.free.fr/Serial_Cloner.html) version 2.6 the UCSC Genome Browser BLAT tool108 (version 438) and the Repbase CENSOR tool109 (version 4.2.22). PCR primers were designed with Primer3110 against TE insertion sequences and their 5′ and 3′ genomic flanks (Supplementary Data 3). Empty/filled PCRs (combining 5′ and 3′ flanking primers) and full-length PCRs (using junction-spanning primers) were performed using an Expand Long Range dNTPack (Roche Cat#: 4829034001). Reaction mixes contained 5 μL 5× Expand Long Range Buffer with 12.5 mM MgCl 2  1.25 μL dNTP Mix (dATP dCTP dGTP dTTP at 10 mM each) 1.25 μL DMSO (100%) 1 μL primer mix (25 μM of each primer) 0.35 μL Expand Long Range Enzyme Mix (5 U/μL) 4–10 ng genomic DNA template and molecular grade water up to a total volume of 25 μL. PCR was performed with the following cycling conditions: 92 °C for 3 min 10 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s 56–60 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 7 min 30 s 25 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s 56–60 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 7 min + 20 s cycle elongation for each successive cycle followed by 68 °C for 10 min. TE-genome junction validation PCRs were performed using MyTaq HS DNA Polymerase (Bioline Cat#: BIO-2111). Reaction mixes contained 5 μL 5× MyTaq Reaction Buffer 0.5 μL primer mix (25 μM of each primer) 0.2 μL MyTaq HS DNA Polymerase 2–4 ng genomic DNA template and molecular grade water up to a total volume of 25 μL. PCRs were performed using the following conditions: 95 °C for 2 min 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s 55/57 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 10 s followed by 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were run on 0.8–2% agarose gels (Bioline Cat#: BIO-41025) depending on fragment size pre-stained with SYBR Safe Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Invitrogen Cat#: S33102). A Typhoon FLA 9000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was used for gel imaging. Gel fragments were excised under a Safe Imager 2.0 Blue-Light Transilluminator (Invitrogen). DNA purification was performed using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Cat#: 28706) or MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Cat#: 28606) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR fragments were either sequenced directly or cloned using the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega Cat#: A1360) and Sanger sequenced to resolve insertion characteristics as shown in Supplementary Data 3.

L1-mCherry retrotransposition assays

The L1-mCherry construct was derived from the construct pTN201 a pCEP4-based vector containing the native mouse element L1 spa 22. The L1 spa coding sequence was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to include two nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions rendering the ORF1p amino acid sequence identical to that of the L1 T F subfamily consensus sequence111112. The 3′UTR was interrupted by a reporter cassette based on previously described L1 retrotransposition indicator plasmids19113. This reporter cassette consisted of the mCherry coding sequence in antisense orientation to the L1 and was equipped with an EF1α promoter and HSVtk polyadenylation signal. The mCherry ORF was interrupted by a β-globin intron oriented in a sense to the L1. The mCherry cassette was cloned using G-block double-stranded DNA fragments synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and PCR products generated using Q5 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Cat#: M0492). The mCherry coding sequence was synthesized with silent mutations ablating potential splice donor and splice acceptor sites that could interfere with intended splicing of the intron. In the L1-mCherry construct the final 157 bp of the L1 spa 3′UTR which included a conserved poly-purine tract was situated downstream of the mCherry cassette and immediately upstream of the pCEP4 SV40 polyadenylation signal112. The L1-mCherry_RT- mutant contained a missense mutation in the reverse transcriptase domain of ORF2 (D709Y)22. Plasmids were prepared using a Qiagen Plasmid Plus Midi Kit and a QIAvac vacuum manifold (Qiagen Cat#: 12145).

HeLa-JVM cells19 were obtained from the laboratory of John V. Moran. These were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 in HeLa complete medium (DMEM Life Technologies Cat#: 11960044) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies Cat#: 10099141) 1% Glutamax (Life Technologies Cat#: 35050061) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies Cat#: 15140122). Cells were passaged at 70–80% confluency using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies Cat#: 25200072). Cultured cell retrotransposition assays were then performed as described previously67113 except retrotransposition was detected by mCherry fluorescence instead of EGFP fluorescence. Briefly 1 × 105 HeLa-JVM cells were seeded per well of a 6-well plate. Eighteen hours later cells were transfected with 1 µg L1-mCherry or L1-mCherry_RT- plasmid per well using 3 µL FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega Cat#: E2311) and 97 µL Opti-MEM (Life Technologies Cat#: 31985047) per well according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Twenty-four hours post-transfection medium was replaced with either HeLa complete medium with 200 µg/mL Hygromycin (Life Technologies Cat#: 10687010) or HeLa complete medium with 200 µg/mL Hygromycin and 100 µM Lamivudine (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#: L1295-10MG). Medium was replaced every other day and at 8 days post-transfection cells were collected by trypsinization resuspended in sterile PBS and analyzed on a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) using the accompanying CytExpert software (version 2.5) to determine the percentage of mCherry positive cells. Three biological replicate assays were performed each consisting of 3 assayed wells per condition (technical replicates). Mouse L1 retrotransposition reporter plasmids can be obtained from the corresponding authors.

L1-mneoI retrotransposition assays

To prepare reporter constructs miPSC_1_L1 and miPSC_4_L1 were amplified from genomic DNA using an Expand Long Range dNTPack (Roche Cat#: 4829034001). Reaction mixes contained 5 μL 5× Expand Long Range Buffer with 12.5 mM MgCl 2  1.25 μL dNTP Mix (dATP dCTP dGTP dTTP at 10 mM each) 1.25 μL DMSO (100%) 1 μL primer mix (50 μM of each primer) 0.35 μL Expand Long Range Enzyme Mix (5U/μL) 10 ng genomic DNA template and molecular grade water up to a total volume of 25 μL. PCRs were performed with the following cycling conditions: 92 °C for 3 min 10 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s 58 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 7 min 30 s; 25 cycles of 92 °C for 30 sec 58 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 7 min plus 20 s elongation for each successive cycle followed by 68 °C for 10 min. Primers introduced a NotI restriction site at the L1 5ʹ end (miPSC_1_L1_F 5ʹ-tttgcggccgcagaaagggaataatcgaggtg-3ʹ; miPSC_1_L1_R 5ʹ-gctaagcttgagaataagtgaagga-3ʹ; miPSC_4_L1_F 5ʹ-agggcggccgcaggattaagaacccaatcaccag-3ʹ; miPSC_4_L1_R 5ʹ-aaaatgcctgttgtgccaat-3ʹ). Reactions were purified using agarose gel electrophoresis. Target fragments were excised and purified using either traditional phenol-chloroform extraction or QIAquick and MinElute Gel Extraction Kits (Qiagen Cat#: 28706 and 28604). Each L1 was then cloned into pGEMT Easy Vector (Promega Cat#: A1360). Ligations were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Ligation reactions were transformed using One Shot TOP10 chemically competent E. coli (Invitrogen Cat#: C404010). Blue/white screening was performed using LB/ampicillin/IPTG/X-Gal plates. At least 3 positive colonies per L1 were chosen for Miniprep culture and plasmid DNA was isolated using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen Cat#: 27106). At least three clones per element were capillary sequenced and compared to identify PCR-induced mutations. Full-length L1s were then reconstructed by combining PCR-mutation free fragments from different clones using restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) recognizing the L1 sequence. Reactions were purified using agarose gel electrophoresis and target fragments were excised and purified using QIAquick and MinElute Gel Extraction Kits (Qiagen Cat#: 28706 and 28604).

pTN201 was used to generate L1 reporter constructs. pTN201 is composed of a pCEP4 backbone (Life Technologies) containing L1 spa  a retrotransposition-competent L1 T F 22 and a downstream mneoI retrotransposition reporter cassette114. The mneoI cassette is driven by an SV40 promoter and holds the neomycin resistance gene which is interrupted by an intron and is positioned antisense to L1spa. In this assay neomycin (or its analog Geneticin/G418) resistance only occurs via transcription splicing and integration of the L1 and mneoI cassette into genomic DNA1967. To measure miPSC_1_L1 and miPSC_4_L1 retrotransposition efficiency L1 spa was removed from the pCEP4 backbone by digesting with NotI and PacI. The pCEP4 backbone was dephosphorylated using Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIP) (New England Biolabs Cat#: M0290). The backbone and fragments of either miPSC_1_L1 or miPSC_4_L1 were combined in a single ligation reaction using T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs Cat#: M0202) and incubated overnight at 16 °C. Ligations were transformed using One Shot TOP10 chemically competent E. coli (Invitrogen Cat#: C404010) and plasmid DNA of positive clones was obtained using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen Cat#: 27106). Clones were verified as mutation-free by capillary sequencing. Plasmid DNA for retrotransposition assays was obtained using a Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen Cat#: 12163). Each construct was built with and without a cytomegalovirus promoter (CMVp) preceding the L1. In addition the following controls each based on a pCEP4 backbone containing the mneoI cassette were employed: TGF21 a retrotransposition-competent L1 G F ;21 L1SM a synthetic codon optimized mouse L1;68 L1SMmut2 L1SM immobilized by reverse transcriptase and endonuclease domains mutations68.

Retrotransposition assays were performed as previously described67 with minor modifications. HeLa-JVM cells were grown in HeLa complete medium (DMEM Life Technologies Cat#: 11960044) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies Cat#: 10099141) 1% Glutamax (Life Technologies Cat#: 35050061) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies Cat#: 15140122) and then seeded at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates. 14–16 h after plating cells were transfected with L1 reporter constructs using 4 μL FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega Cat#: E2311) 96 μL Opti-MEM (Life Technologies Cat#: 31985047) and 1 μg plasmid DNA per well. Transfection efficiencies were determined in parallel by preparing transfection mixes containing 4 μL FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega Cat#: E2311) 96 μL Opti-MEM (Life Technologies Cat#: 31985047) 0.5 μg L1 expression plasmid and 0.5 μg pCEP4-eGFP. The transfection mixture was added to each well containing 2 mL DMEM-complete medium. Plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 2  medium replaced 24 h post-transfection and transfection efficiency determined 72 h post-transfection. pCEP4-eGFP transfected wells were trypsinized and cells were collected from each well and centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 300–500 μL 1× PBS. The number of eGFP-positive cells was determined using a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The percentage of eGFP-positive cells was used to normalize the G418-resistant colony counts for each L1 reporter construct67. G418 (400 μg/mL) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#: 10131035) selection was started 3 days post-transfection and performed for 12 days. G418 foci were washed with 1× PBS and fixed using 2% Formaldehyde/0.2% Glutaraldehyde in 1× PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) fixing solution at room temperature for 30 min. Staining was done using 0.1% Crystal Violet solution (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 10 min. Foci were counted in each well to quantify retrotransposition.

L1 bisulfite sequencing experiments

Bisulfite conversion was performed with 200 ng input genomic DNA from miPSC lines and MEFs using a EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning Kit (Zymo Research Cat#: D5030) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was eluted in 10 μL Elution Buffer. The internal sequences of L1 T F monomers were amplified genome-wide with the following primers: BS_TfIII_mono_F 5′-GGAAATTAGTTTGAATAGGTTAGAGGGTG; BS_TfIII_mono_R 5′-TCCTAAATTCCAAAAAATCCTAAAACCAAA. The following locus-specific primers were used to target the 5′ promoter region of the following elements of interest: BS_miPSC_1_L1_F 5′-TGATTTATTTTTGATTGAATTTATTTTTAT; BS_miPSC_1_L1_R/donor_L1_R 5′-CTATTCAAACTAATTTCCTAAATTCTACTA; BS_miPSC_3_L1_F 5′-TAGTTGGGGTTGTATGATGTAAGTT; BS_miPSC_3_L1_R 5′-TCCCAAAAACTATCTAATTCTCTAAC; BS_miPSC_4_L1_F 5′-TTTATATTGAAGGTTTGGATGATTTTATAT; BS_miPSC_4_L1_R 5′-TCCAATTCTCTAATACACCCTCTAAC; BS_donor_L1_F 5′-TTAAAGAAGTTAGTGATTTTTTAGAATTTT.

PCRs were performed using MyTaq HS DNA Polymerase (Bioline Cat#: BIO-21111). Reaction mixes contained 5 μL 5× MyTaq Reaction Buffer 0.5 μL primer mix (25 μM of each primer) 0.2 μL MyTaq HS DNA Polymerase DMSO at a final concentration of 0.1% 2 μL bisulfite converted DNA template and molecular grade water up to a total volume of 25 μL. PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 95 °C for 2 min 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s 54 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s followed by 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel excised and purified using a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Cat#: 28604) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina libraries were constructed using a NEBNext UltraTM II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs Cat#: E7645). Libraries were quantified using a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent Technologies Cat#: 5067-1504). Barcoded libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts and sequenced as 2x300mer reads on an Illumina MiSeq platform using a MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina Cat#: MS-102-3003). 50% PhiX Control v3 (Illumina Cat#: FC-110-3001) was used as a spike-in. Sequencing data were analyzed as described previously34. To summarize for the L1 T F genome-wide analysis paired-end reads were considered separately and those with the L1 T F bisulfite PCR primers at their termini were retained and aligned to the mock converted T F monomer target amplicon sequence with blastn. Reads where non-CpG cytosine bisulfite conversion was <95% or ≥5% of CpG dinucleotides were mutated or ≥5% of adenine and guanine nucleotides were mutated were removed. 50 reads per sample excluding identical bisulfite sequences were randomly selected and analyzed using QUMA115 version 1.1.16 with default parameters with strict CpG recognition. Specific L1 loci were analyzed in a similar fashion except paired-end reads were assembled into contigs as described elsewhere34 prior to blastn alignment to the mock converted L1 locus target amplicon.

Nanopore sequencing analyses

Genomic DNA was extracted from 6 miPSC lines reprogrammed in the presence of 100 µM 3TC 6 miPSC lines generated without 3TC and the parental MEFs with a Nanobind CBB Big DNA Kit (Circulomics Cat#: NB-900-001-01) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA libraries were prepared at the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics (KCCG Australia) using 3 μg input DNA without shearing and an SQK-LSK110 ligation sequencing kit. Libraries were each sequenced separately on a PromethION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) flow cell (FLO-PRO002 R9.4.1 chemistry) (Supplementary Data 1). Bases were called with guppy 5.0.13 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies).

Non-reference TE insertions were detected with TLDR35. Briefly this involved aligning ONT reads to the mm10 reference genome using minimap2116 version 2.20 (index parameter: -x map-ont; alignment parameters: -ax map-ont -L -t 32) and SAMtools117 version 1.12. BAM files were then processed as a group with TLDR35 version 1.2.2 (parameters -e teref.mouse.fa -p 128 -m 1 -r mm10.fa -n nonref.collection.mm10.chr.bed.gz --keep_pickles). The files teref.mouse.fa composed of TE family consensus sequences and nonref.collection.mm10.chr.bed.gz a collection of known non-reference retrotransposon insertions are available from github.com/adamewing/tldr/. The TLDR output table was further processed to remove calls not passing relevant TLDR filters where family = “NA” or remappable = “FALSE” or UnmapCover <0.5 or LengthIns <100 or EndTE-StartTE <100 or strand = “None” or SpanReads <1. 3ʹ truncated TE insertions and B1 or B2 insertions 5ʹ truncated by more than 2 bp were removed. Events detected in only one miPSC line and not matching a known non-reference insertion were designated as putative de novo insertions (Supplementary Data 3).

Reference TE methylation was assessed for parental MEFs and miPSC lines aggregated by condition (reprogrammed with or without 3TC) using Methylartist version 1.2.482. Briefly CpG methylation calls were generated from ONT reads using nanopolish version 0.13.2118. Using Methylartist commands db-nanopolish segmeth and segplot with default parameters methylation statistics were generated for the genome divided into 10kbp bins protein-coding gene promoters defined the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (−1000bp+500 bp)119 and reference TEs defined by RepeatMasker coordinates. TE families displayed in Fig. 4a included T F  G F  and A-type L1s > 6kbp B1 and B2 SINEs and MERVL MT2 and IAP elements represented by their long terminal repeats. Methylation values were calculated for L1 5ʹUTRs only excluding the L1 body. Methylation profiles for individual loci were generated using the Methylartist command locus. L1 T F methylation profiles shown in Fig. 4b were generated for elements >7kbp with the Methylartist command composite. To identify individual differentially methylated TEs (Supplementary Data 5) we required elements to have at least 4 reads and 20 methylation calls in each of the MEF aggregated control miPSC and aggregated 3TC-treated miPSC datasets. Statistical comparisons were performed based on methylated and unmethylated CpG call counts using Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.

L1-mCherry retrotransposition events were recovered via ONT sequencing in a similar fashion to the analysis of mouse samples except genomic DNA obtained from 5 HeLa cell lines expanded over 3–5 passages from single L1-mCherry insertion-harboring colonies was barcoded using a SQK-MLK111.96-XL kit pooled in equimolar amounts and sequenced on a single PromethION flow cell. Reads were aligned to the hg38 human reference genome build. L1-mCherry insertions were then identified using TLDR as for the endogenous mouse TE analysis described above.

Statistics and reproducibility

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9 with the exception of Supplementary Fig. 1 (Seaborn version 0.9) and Supplementary Data 5 (SciPy version 1.4.1). Data were presented in histograms as mean ± SD and replicate (n) values provided in the corresponding figure legends. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Experiments were designed to obtain at least biological triplicate data. No data were excluded from the analysis. One miPSC line from animal A172 astrocytes generated insufficient cells for subsequent genomic analyses. Experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to sample identity. PCR experiments to validate TE insertions were repeated independently at least twice with on-target amplicons (as shown in Fig. 1b–e Fig. 2b–f Fig. 3e Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 9) confirmed by capillary sequencing. Retrotransposition assays as shown in Fig. 1h and Fig. 3b were performed on three different days (independent biological replicates) with three wells per assay (technical replicates).

We may earn commission when you click on or make a purchase.

My garage is full of outdated frames and photographs. If I want to use the frames again eliminating the old prints is hard. It’s a bonfire waiting to happen.

As a professional photographer and exhibit artist I have many years of experience framing and displaying artwork. I’ve done my share of family portraits and created wall art from my travel photography for clients and myself. I began using gallery wraps to display my travel photos and avoid the costs of framing a piece but that process isn’t accessible to everyone.

Enter Fracture a Gainesville Florida-based company that’s been turning digital images into simple frameless works of art since 2009. Fracture offers made-in-America products that are uncomplicated and easy to understand. The pricing structure is straightforward and the online ordering process is clear-cut and effortless.

Note: This Fracture product was sent to me to review. I used my photograph and worked through the process on the Fracture website. Following is what I discovered and all opinions are my own.

What Is A Glass Photo?

Fracture has a detailed video showing its hand-crafting process of printing photos on shatter-resistant glass. Watching their process and learning about how much care they put into their product and delivery I gained confidence in their ability to meet my standards.

After the glass is cut to size the edges are polished. Then…

To print photos on glass Fracture scores it and applies colored ink except for white directly onto the glass. The Fracture process doesn’t involve any photo prints stuck to glass. After the colors are UV cured the final step in the photo printing process is the application of an opaque white coating to the back to seal all the colors and make them pop.

Fracture Glass Photos: The Perfect Gift

How It Works

First set up an account on the Fracture website. Then explore their offerings. Or you can jump right in and hit the “Upload a photo” button. The button is located above the fold on the Home page. It is intuitive and easy to follow. You can also select the “Get Started” button at the top of every page.

Select and upload the image or images that you want to print. Drag and drop your photos in various shapes and sizes including square horizontal or vertical. Create a gallery with three four five or six prints.

Place your order decide on the shipping method and delivery timing that you prefer make your payment and receive confirmation. The entire process takes a matter of minutes. I completed it on my iPhone.

Shipping Process

I was eager to see how my Fracture package would arrive. The packing process doesn’t use bubble wrap Styrofoam or packing peanuts. Fracture’s commitment to responsible manufacturing with carbon-neutral sustainability and reduced waste is impressive.

The innovative shipping container made of strong cardboard with an interior channel holds the print securely. The glass print has a rigid mat board affixed to the back and is tightly strapped onto another piece of sturdy cardboard.

Fracture’s advanced shipping process is effective. Fracture wants its customers to love their prints and the packaging plays a crucial role in delivery.

What It Costs

While a Fracture picture may seem pricey it is an innovative cost-effective option for getting your memories out of your smartphone or computer and onto your walls without the added cost of framing.

You might ask yourself “Is it worth it?”

The cost is reasonable when you consider the cost of a high-quality professional print with finish matting framing hardware for hanging and possibly hiring someone to hang it for you. Everything required to display your Fracture prints including the printed wall gallery template comes in the package.

Prices range from $25 small prints (5”x5”) to $179 extra-large prints (21.6”x28.8”). The medium prints (7.2”x9.6”) are the most popular at $50. Print sizes on the order page show small medium large and extra-large options.

Pro Tip: Another cost-saving option is to create a Photo Wall and replace individual photos in the months or years to come for a gallery update of sorts. Your Photo Wall will become a living artwork display that you can change readily and confidently thanks to the Fracture process.

My Fracture Picture Review

When evaluating a new photo product I wear two hats. One is as a professional photographer where I advise clients about their portrait wall art and we discuss finishing and framing options. With travel memories I consider how to display the images for the best viewer impact. That means getting them out of the digital realm and into a physical display or gallery.

The density of the image is an important feature. Is it too dark or too light? I found the Fracture photo to be the perfect density.

Sharpness and detail in the finished product are a result of file size. Is the Fracture photo as sharp as the original or did it lose resolution when it was enlarged for print? Sharpness is an issue that I discuss in further detail below.

The second hat I wear is as a consumer where I decide what goes on the walls of my home.

A collection of my favorite travel memories will always be in my home. A concern is ensuring printed photos fit with the decor in the house. Without frames you don’t have to match furniture or style.

Lighting plays an essential role in your Fracture pictures. I like a sharp glossy finish on my photos. However the matte finish diffuses light reduces glare and gives it a soft look.

Can I size my print so that it prints edge to edge or am I a slave to the printer size which is not uncommon? A Fracture print is simple so it doesn’t need to fit into a standard-sized bulky frame.

When I held the Fracture picture in my hands and examined it thoroughly I was pleased with the quality of the production and realized just how durable the picture was.

Fracture Print Gifts

A physical or digital Fracture gift card makes a unique and welcome holiday gift. Travelers will love to showcase their memories with Fracture prints. A Fracture print or gallery is perfect for growing families travelers of any age and children and adults who love to take pictures.

A Note On File Preparation

Preparing your file will be the most time-consuming part of your photo-ordering process. Delivering a high-resolution digital file to Fracture or any photo processing lab e.g. 20MB versus 5MB files is essential.

Resist enlarging your photos to avoid noticeable pixelation. A high-resolution file should be free of pixelation otherwise known as noise. If you pay attention to this step sharpness will be maintained throughout the enlargement process which will be taken care of on Fracture’s end.

The Fracture ordering process is easy. The innovative packaging and quality control are unparalleled. I appreciate the 60-day guarantee the eco-friendly production and that Fracture prints are made in America.

The Tyson Immigration Partnership (TIP) supported seven facilities over this past year as a widespread labor shortage continued to plague the industry.

The company said working with Arkansas’ non-profit groups which included the Arkansas Immigrant Defense and the Immigrant Connection has helped more than 500 workers seeking citizenship by assisting with employment authorization renewals petitions for citizenship and other legal services. Workers are also reimbursed for application fees as they pursue citizenship a process that costs upwards of $725. Immigrant Connection officials are hosting monthly informational meetings for workers at 27 Tyson locations across the country while Arkansas Immigrant Defense is visiting employees at 13 locations in Arkansas.

With a US workforce consisting of workers from more than 160 countries Tyson said expanding the TIP program is the latest effort to become an industry-leading employer. Officials said it is an employer of choice for many immigrants due to its average hourly pay of more than $18 and its generous benefit plan which equates to an average annual compensation value of more than $50000.

“We care about our team members and want to help them achieve their goals including those who have dreams of becoming US citizens and having greater access to opportunities our country has to offer” said John R. Tyson executive vice president and chief sustainability officer. “We’re working hard to help team members who want and need assistance with their lawful immigration status or the complex and expensive process of becoming a citizen. We want to be the most sought-after place to work and this is one way we hope to do that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2pvaG4tZ3JlZW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzgyOTQ1MTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Green Obituary (2022) - Amelia VA - M.

Founded in 2015 by the cardiologist turned CEO Dr. Uma Valeti UPSIDE Foods recently received FDA approval for consumers to eat the lab-grown chicken filet. He hopes this will allow the product to hit shelves “really soon.”

As far as price point for the option Valeti says it is the company’s “aspirational goal at the moment is to beat the conventional prices” but it won’t happen right away.

“Initially we're going to start out with premium pricing when we come into the market ... That's because we are on a small scale. Our labor force is really very highly educated and requires a lot of time to put together the product that we put on the market. But in time we expect our products to be at parity with conventional meat but that's going to be 5 to 15 years away.”

The FDA approval was key to kick off production at its facility in California too which it calls the Engineering Production and Innovation Center (EPIC) which has the capability to produce 50000 pounds of meat.

""We are not producing it at that level because we've been waiting for the FDA green light to start production processes but we're doing a lot of learning and continue to update our technology and it's moving at such a pace that we need an innovation center like this to continuously update not only the hardware and how the meat is made but also the feed that we feed our animal cells.”

This is one step toward UPSIDE Foods' larger goal to provide sustainable meat poultry and seafood options. As a result of rapid evolution in the technology used to develop its products Valeti says the equipment developed in 2019 is already outdated. That’s not stopping the company from its hefty goals ahead.

“We're now in the process of looking for the right location to build a production facility that is about 50 times larger than EPIC and is capable of producing something in the range of [10 to 20 million pounds] of product every year and we are looking for it actively … We hope that states will reach out to us to put our facility in their region.”

UPSIDE Foods recently closed a $400 million Series C which brings it to a $1 billion valuation. So far the company has raised a total of $608 million including from sustainability advocates Bill Gates Kimbal and Christiana Musk and Richard Branson in addition to funding from companies like Tyson Foods. It also has a partnership with Dominique Crenn a three-Michelin starred chef.

Ask any athlete or parent at U.S. Bank Stadium Saturday — and they’d be more than happy to tell you about the Prep Bowl.

“It’s amazing it really is” exclaimed Max Baumgartner a Dilworth-Glyndon-Felton player. “I mean it’s a blessing.”

“Over the top exciting over the top” adds Heidi Nelson a Mankato West parent.

The Minnesota Viking home turf temporarily taken over by pumped-up high school players from across the state all vying for state championship wins.



“I’m from a small town” Baumgartner explains. “I came here to watch Vikings games I came here to watch when they came here in 2016. I could never imagine doing it. It’s amazing.”

Many eyes were on the Class 5A game between Elk River and Mankato West.

High school football players at the Prep Bowl Saturday night (KSTP).

“These boys have such a camaraderie they work so hard” says Dan Nelson from Mankato.

He and his wife Heidi shared photos and stories about their two boys on the Mankato West team.

Chris #51 — is a senior and his brother Kaden #66 — is junior.



“You have a brother you don’t in other sports” Heidi notes. “You know these boys here have each other’s backs. On the field off the field everywhere.”

There’s plenty of family pride here but also hometown pride.

Making it — to use a baseball phrase — “to the show.”

“It’s awesome it’s supercool the Elks made it here!” enthused Ethan Hazman. “(People) are saying let’s go Elks!”

Each side of the stadium was packed with fans from opposing teams.

Lucas Cooper 26 — came to cheer on his 17-year-old brother Joel who’s playing left guard for Elk River.



“I’m really excited for him” he says. “I think he’s the only one of us siblings to ever be in the state championship playing this field obviously.”

But this was more than Saturday night lights.

There’s gridiron glory in the place Vikings players call home no matter who your team is.

“We’ve been to plenty of games in Mankato” smiles Mike Moriarty who’s here to support his team. “But this is a different level different experience all together and it’s a lot warmer.”

“He sends us pictures behind the scenes and inside the building” Cooper adds about his brother. “He seems pretty excited.”

Win or lose there were memories for the players and their families — enough to last a lifetime.



“You look around when you’re playing the game it really doesn’t seem like it” Baumgartner notes. “But when you look around on the sideline and right now it’s amazing.”

Elk River won the game 29-26 breaking Mankato West’s 31-game winning streak.

Still — many say they were just glad to be here enjoying watching so many skilled players with a passion for football.



“The work ethic and the time they put into it and they really love the sport” Nelson says. “It’s fun as parents to watch them grow and excel.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tY2tpbnNleS5jb20vY2FwYWJpbGl0aWVzL3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L291ci1pbnNpZ2h0cy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1ibG9nL3ByaW5jaXBsZXMtdG8tY2F0YWx5emUtaW1wYWN0LWZyb20tdXMtZ3JlZW4tYmFuay1maW5hbmNpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Principles to catalyze impact from US green bank financing,"Twenty-seven billion US dollars in “green bank financing” through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GHGRF) is intended to drive investment in solutions that reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and support investment in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Adhering to a set of impact principles can unlock the transformative potential of this funding including focusing on where the benefits are greatest galvanizing a distributed financing network gaining optimal financial leverage deploying a mix of financing vehicles to catalyze private investment and mobilizing rapidly to meet 2030 targets.

To meet its net-zero target by 2050 the United States would need to quadruple its annual low-carbon investment reaching a total of $9 trillion over this decade.1 Almost half of the emissions reductions needed to reach the net-zero target come from a transformational and immediate shift in the energy system toward renewable-power generation and electrification of transportation and buildings.2 Some of these emissions are geographically concentrated—ten states make up 50 percent of US power sector emissions which are further concentrated in specific communities with large fossil-fuel power plants.3 Other emissions reductions depend on deploying a few key technologies (such as electric vehicles and heat pumps) at scale across communities. Crucially much of the challenge lies in disadvantaged communities where effective solutions are needed for those who are marginalized and overburdened by climate change and pollution and who often lack access to finance and find many climate solutions unaffordable.4

As part of the response to this challenge Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will allocate $27 billion in Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding through the GHGRF for climate and environmental justice.5 As a complement to the broader IRA package this funding includes $20 billion in competitive grants to eligible nonprofit financing institutions to address finance-related barriers to reduce or avoid GHG emissions (and other forms of air pollution) and to assist community efforts toward this goal through financial and technical assistance. At least $8 billion of the $20 billion in GHGRF funding is required to support low-income and disadvantaged communities which face large unmet financing needs and lower access to capital and financial services. Recipients either new or existing nonprofit organizations can deliver financing directly or in partnership with intermediaries—the United States has a network of more than 20 state and local green banks and more than 1300 community development financial organizations (CDFIs) focused on local lending and community development. The GHGRF also includes a further $7 billion set aside for states municipalities tribal governments or other recipients to deliver financing and support for zero-emission technologies.

GHGRF funding could play a pivotal role alongside the broader IRA in bending the curve toward an inclusive net-zero trajectory. Five key impact principles can help achieve this potential:

1. Focus on technologies and communities where the benefits are greatest

Achieving impact depends on targeting financing toward technologies and areas that deliver significant emissions reductions and outsize benefits to disadvantaged communities. This means breaking new ground to deliver opportunities that achieve both emissions reductions and environmental justice and balancing between objectives where necessary. It may be challenging to maximize all goals for GHGRF funding in all investments but by targeting these multiple goals in aggregate the funding can support high impact.

Targeting financing toward technologies and geographies with the greatest potential for emissions reduction. This might mean focusing on region-specific challenges such as decarbonizing older buildings in the Northeast or coal-dependent power production in the Northeast and Midwest. It might include a focus on technologies such as transportation electrification that enable sectorwide transformation and are needed across the country. It might also include a focus on coordinating and enabling cross-state projects such as transmission lines that are critical to the deployment of renewables which are difficult to manage and may particularly benefit from at-scale capital. 6

Targeting support toward disadvantaged communities that have been most burdened by climate change face specific investment challenges or have been particularly underserved by traditional financial institutions.7 This could include explicit allocation objectives; for example Cleveland’s GO Green Energy Fund targets low-income communities.8 It could also include the propagation of replicable investment models such as the Solar for All programs across US states that support low- and middle-income households installing solar power.9

2. Galvanize a distributed financing network

Effectively deploying priority technologies depends on leveraging local knowledge and expertise coordinating best practices and building publicly available resources to reach customers and accelerate demand. This includes coordinating an ecosystem that delivers technologies on the ground and customizing financing to local circumstances especially in disadvantaged communities.

Working directly or in partnership with local institutions and intermediaries that have established relationships with end customers and with supply chains to deliver effective investment. This may include local CDFIs alongside commercial financial institutions and businesses. This includes a range of interventions to build demand such as grants or other funding for customer engagement and awareness building. For example local green banks such as Michigan Saves and CDFIs such as Florida SELF have spent years building relationships with local contractor networks landowners and credit unions gaining community trust and helping drive deal flow.

Skills and knowledge building across these local ecosystems to increase their effectiveness through resources such as standardized green-financing procedures and documents replicable supplier agreements and common metrics and technology infrastructure to monitor and evaluate impact. For example the CDFI Fund provides technical assistance awards of up to $125000 to build the capacity of CDFIs through hiring training and other activities.10

3. Gain optimal leverage from GHGRF funding

Deploying initial funding with appropriate and responsible leverage can increase the overall capital deployed and its impact. Private cofinancing capital recycling and a well-balanced portfolio can all support catalyzing investment at greater scales. However obtaining the right balance of private sector leverage versus targeting additionality and targeting impact for beneficiaries will be important for achieving overall GHGRF goals. Optimal leverage will vary based on technology maturity community needs and the availability of complementary grant-based programs with lower leverage ratios likely when investing in less established technologies or disadvantaged communities. Approaches may also need to balance short-term private leverage against longer-term market catalyzation goals.

Co-investment and strategic use of risk-reducing instruments (such as guarantees) to directly crowd in private investment. This might include concessional terms for unsecured lending or underwriting real or perceived risks in the absence of a market track record. American green banks mobilized $1.7 billion in total clean-energy investments from $440 million of their own financing in 2020 alone. 11

Efficient capital management and securitization of loans (for sale to private partners) to free up capital for new lending. This includes capital management to minimize undeployed capital as well as support for aggregation and securitization of smaller loans. These activities also pave the way for future securitizations in that asset class when scale is reached. Examples include the Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority’s Green Energy Market Securitization Program which reduces the cost of clean-energy loans to consumers through a rate-reduction bond structure. 12

Balancing less risky investments against riskier ones within a portfolio to promote financial stability while also supporting high-risk technologies and disadvantaged communities. This could potentially enable debt issuance while also affording room for lower returns or higher losses in some segments of the portfolio. In one approach Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation has built a lending portfolio that includes commercial-rate senior loans whose proceeds are explicitly used to cross-subsidize other concessional-rate lending programs.13

4. Deploy a mix of financing vehicles flexibly to catalyze markets at scale

Achieving transformational impact means green bank financing and its leveraged cofinancing must address key constraints to investment. This requires a focus on investment approaches and specialized knowledge that are continually at the forefront removing the specific barriers to private financing – which can also leave behind the conditions for pure private financing in the future.

Financing approaches to remove technology-specific challenges such as technology performance risk construction and operational cost risks lack of liquidity and regulatory uncertainty and market immaturity. The United Kingdom’s Green Investment Bank invested in a series of offshore wind projects to tackle these risks at key stages in the deployment journey accelerating competitive private financing of the sector. 14

Approaches to overcome access to finance challenges for low-income groups—for example in relation to credit history lack of collateral mismatches between ability to pay and investment costs and small ticket size. Various state and local green banks support the rollout of residential solar panels with on-bill payments as opposed to traditional loans for example and they have used targeted funding to bring down the costs of technology or borrowing. 15

Systematic learning and flexibility in how financing is allocated to support reprioritization of investment toward approaches with the greatest demonstrated impact and where additional public support is most necessary. This also involves ending financing where the private sector has stepped in. For example the Connecticut Green Bank withdrew direct investment support for commercial property assessed clean energy (C-PACE) lending programs in 2015 as the market matured and private investors filled its role.16

5. Mobilize investment quickly

Given the scale and urgency of US plans to cut emissions by 50–52 percent by 2030 rapid deployment by recipients of funding would be needed to jump-start investment and the learning by doing that drives market transformation—while making sure not to leave behind communities that need more time to roll out investment at scale. Rapidly defining robust criteria and guidance for targeting and disbursing funds can support effective mobilization.

Initially focusing funding on more advanced technologies and on helping existing intermediaries fund established pipelines of projects. For example in its first year of operation the UK Infrastructure Bank established in 2021 initially focused on a mix of direct project lending and cornerstone investment in smaller funds that were ready to receive capital. In the United States alongside the broader IRA incentive programs green bank financing could potentially mobilize a large array of intermediaries including retailers with existing customer campaigns.

Offering funding commitments like lines of credit or conditional grants that rapidly enable a large number of partner intermediaries to advance financing opportunities without tying up capital before projects are ready for financing. Various multilateral development banks have built out finance facilities over the past two decades demonstrating the power of such facilities to mobilize a large network relatively quickly. For example the Green Economy Finance Facility of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development reaches more than 140 local financial institutions across 26 countries.17

Done well green bank financing can overcome critical barriers to investment unlocking the power of private finance at a scale well beyond the initial funding. Numerous examples demonstrate the feasibility of best practices and their outsize impact. By adhering to the above impact principles we believe GHGRF recipients can drive a system transformation. There is much experience to build upon an urgency to bring together the best of the best and more.

In early 2023 McKinsey will follow up on these principles with a quantitative assessment of the potential for GHGRF green bank financing to catalyze investments and support climate and environmental-justice objectives. The report will quantify the impact of this green bank financing across GHG emissions reductions job creation cost savings and health improvements for disadvantaged communities and for the United States as a whole.

If you’re like me when you’re taking an Uber or Lyft then you just want to get to your destination in absolute silence. It’s always a gamble to begin a conversation with a total stranger even if it’s usually pleasant. But it would be so much worse if the Uber or Lyft driver used that opportunity—of having a captive passenger—to preach his or her religion.

Both ride-sharing companies have strict rules prohibiting religious discrimination. Drivers cannot refuse a customer for example who is very clearly not a member of their faith. But there’s no rule blocking drivers from proselytizing and attempting to win new converts and Christians know it.

A recent Associated Press article focused on Lyft drivers who see their work as “mobile Christian ministries.”

“The car is such an ideal place to do this because it’s personal” said [Pastor Kenneth] Drayton who now drives for Lyft. “I can share my faith and it’s so important because that’s what I live for.” … He always plays classical music on his car stereo (his favorite is Mozart) to encourage a calm pleasant mood. He begins with a greeting and a kind word. His priority he says is to introduce passengers to Christ but he’s respectful if they’re not receptive. They’re often Christian but he has also spoken to atheists Buddhists Hindus Jews and Muslims. Instead of trying to preach he says he focuses his message on the love of God and tends to avoid doctrine.

If that wording makes his ruse seem mild that’s unfortunate because nothing about it is okay. To treat a customer as a potential convert rather than a client changes the relationship even if Drayton makes clear he respects passengers who don’t want to hear his spiel.

It would be more respectful if he didn’t work off the assumption that his clients want to change their religious beliefs.

It’s not like he’s an anomaly either. A quick search on Twitter reveals a number of people who have had to deal with people just like him:

Y’all don’t understand boundaries https://t.co/Acu9tz07HK — Barny Emordi (@barnyee_) January 17 2021

There’s a belief among many evangelicals that there shouldn’t be any boundaries when it comes to sharing the faith. But there’s a substantive difference between using personal social media podcasts or TV shows to do it—where recipients can always block the noise or change the channel—and doing it as part of a ride-share company where passengers may not be able to leave the car and the preacher is literally the person in the driver’s seat.

While the subjects of the AP article insist they can take no for an answer there’s no way for passengers to know what might make a driver snap. How many of their customers smiled and nodded or pretended to want to hear about Jesus because they worried about what might happen if they said they weren’t interested?

It’s one thing to make small talk about work or hobbies. It’s not even necessarily a problem if religion comes up in a casual conversation. But no one in that situation should dig any deeper into a stranger’s life without explicit permission.

The Freedom From Religion Foundation is now calling for both companies to put a stop to this before it gets worse:

No one should have to pay to be missionized against their will… Non-religious and minority religious riders do not feel included or welcomed when they are confronted with proselytizing while stuck in a moving vehicle with a driver preaching at them. … Such ranting is a distraction and potential traffic hazard. Minimally they may feel they must humor or placate the driver who is disrespecting their views. At worst they may feel personally threatened or be in jeopardy if they express disagreement. We request that [Lyft/Uber] uphold its commitment to maintaining an inclusive and welcoming community by implementing clear policies prohibiting its drivers from proselytizing preaching or otherwise utilizing its services to advance their personal religious viewpoints.

FFRF isn’t calling for censorship. They’re not overreacting to mild mentions of religion. They’re simply asking both companies to think of their customers and make rides more welcoming for everyone. It’s just good business! Just as you wouldn’t want a driver who holds wildly different political views from you attempting to start a debate or a driver casually bringing up a topic that makes you uncomfortable no one should have to worry about having religion shoved in their faces when all they want—and all they’re paying for—is a ride somewhere.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9jYXJlZXJzL2N1c3RvbWVyLXNlcnZpY2UvMjAyMi8xMi8wMy9ob3ctbXVjaC1kb2VzLWRvb3JkYXNoLXBheS84MDYzNjU3MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How much does DoorDash pay? What about Uber Eats? Online food delivery compensation.,"The global online food delivery market reached $189.7 billion in 2021 and is only expected to grow according to Grand View Research.

In the fourth quarter of the business year DoorDash and Uber Eats both made impressive progress. DoorDash recorded all-time high order numbers and Uber Eats turned a profit for the first time according to Protocol — but which one company is better to work for?

Whether you’re a self-starter looking for ways to supplement your income or a customer wondering about your delivery worker’s wages here’s the information you’re after.

Do you tip Uber and Lyft drivers? Rideshare tipping and compensation explained.

Is Uber safe? What about Lyft? Addressing safety concerns of passengers and drivers.

How much does DoorDash pay?

Dashers make a base pay between $2 and $10 per delivery depending on factors such as duration distance and desirability of the order according to DoorDash. The company claims its drivers make approximately $25 per hour of work including 100% of tips from customers.

Ridester reports drivers can expect to make between $10 and $25 per hour. Ridester emphasizes though that DoorDash drivers are responsible for their own vehicle expenses such as gas and maintenance so Dashers do not pocket all of their earnings and tips.

The company also offers promotions which allow drivers to earn more money including Peak Pay Guaranteed Earnings and Challenge Bonuses.

How much do Uber drivers make?:That depends on where you drive

How much do Lyft drivers make?:What we know

How do DoorDash drivers get paid?

Dashers can choose to receive their pay a number of ways according to the company. Options include a weekly direct deposit at no charge a Fast Pay option which charges a $1.99 fee per daily withdrawal and a DasherDirect prepaid debit card which provides instant deposits with no fee after every delivery.

According to DoorDash drivers can also opt into receiving cash on delivery orders.

How much does Uber Eats pay?

Uber Eats drivers as of the summer of 2022 make an average of $9.37 per trip and $15.84 per hour according to Gridwise. Like many rideshare drivers Uber Eats drivers are also responsible for their own vehicle expenses.

How much to tip for DoorDash and Uber Eats

DoorDash and Uber Eats workers should always be tipped. The standard in the restaurant industry is 15 to 20% according to Shopfood. But Ridester says a minimum tip amount between $4 and $6 should be the norm on all orders; even a very cheap delivery may require the same driving or biking distance as a more expensive meal.

If your delivery driver has to endure inclement weather that should also boost their tip. Ridester suggests rideshare drivers working in adverse weather conditions should be rewarded for their willingness to work when others are staying inside.

Tip generously

How much you tip when ordering on food delivery apps could influence how quickly you get your order couriers say.

That's because tips which apps like SkipTheDishes UberEats and DoorDash prompt customers to add before their order even arrives make up a big part of their fare — and couriers are assessing whether your order is worth the trip.

""We make essentially nothing unless there's tips involved. The base rate from these companies is between $2 to $3 [per order]"" said Ashley a driver in Montreal who shares her experience delivering for the apps on YouTube.

The services have made ordering food from restaurants easier than ever creating a market for delivery that goes well beyond pizza and launching an entire economy of gig-based workers. According to pre-pandemic data from Statistics Canada approximately one in 10 working Canadians was part of the gig economy.

Food delivery drivers are paid a set fee per delivery and don't earn an hourly rate meaning many couriers are looking for the best offer possible.

Higher-paying offers which typically include a generous tip get snatched up quickly couriers said. Meanwhile low-paying offers with a lousy tip or no tip in advance can bounce from one driver to the next.

""If I get an order for $3 and it says 'Go seven kilometres' I'm going to decline that. I never go more kilometres than dollars because I'm not going to make any money"" Ashley told CBC Radio's Cost of Living. CBC is withholding her last name due to concerns she could be kicked off the platforms for speaking out.

Some couriers say tip baiting — offering a higher tip then reducing it after delivery — is a problem in the industry. (Carlos Osorio/CBC)

Tips can make up between 40 and 70 per cent of delivery people's wages according to Gig Workers United an organizing group for gig-economy workers supported by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.

Half of gig workers use that work to supplement their income while for the other half it makes up the sole source of their income Statistics Canada reports.

Customers 'bidding' for faster delivery

Both UberEats and DoorDash say that they provide couriers information about their potential earnings for every order. SkipTheDishes did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Brennan Tilley a regular user of food delivery apps in Calgary said that offering up a good tip ensures that he gets his food when he wants it. He sees it as a form of ""bidding"" for the fastest drop-off.

""The person that puts a $2 tip on [their order] the drivers don't want their order and they take my order. So I'm quite happy with all these people that are refusing to tip because then my order moves the top of the pack with my tip"" Tilley said.

""It is definitely worth $10 $12 whatever it is for someone to go grab that for me as soon as possible.""

Brennan Tilley who lives in Calgary says he's happy to tip well knowing that it could mean getting his food order a little sooner. (Submitted by Brennan Tilley)

It's a system that labour advocates say underscores the lack of minimum wage protections for couriers delivering for app-based platforms.

""When we talk about tips being a necessary part of our income they are because apps are actively working to reduce our rate of pay as much as is possible to increase their profit"" said Jennifer Scott president of Gig Workers United.

Depending on the app she said couriers can be penalized for declining orders — impacting something called an ""acceptance rate"" — and eventually be removed from a platform.

The delivery method — driving compared to walking for example — can also limit the number of shifts available to couriers Scott added.

""I didn't have the luxury of declining a low-paying offer because it might have been the only one that I got for an hour"" she said.

Both UberEats and DoorDash said couriers are free to decline any orders. DoorDash said couriers are never removed based on declined orders.

'Tip baiting' an issue for couriers

Some customers have found ways to game the tip-for-service system. On UberEats customers have the option of offering a big tip — only to slash it within an hour of the order reaching the doorstep.

""That's tip baiting"" said Ashley. ""Because you might know that the driver can see the tip and you're doing it to get faster delivery services.

""It happens left right and centre. I [hear from] drivers that I would say one out of 20 orders are getting tip-baited. So I find myself very fortunate that it's only been two out of 400 but it happens very often.""

UberEats said tips are reduced in only one per cent of orders while ""closer to 10 per cent"" see an increased tip after delivery. The company is testing new ways to ""guard against deliberately misleading tipping"" its statement read.

But Ashley would prefer to not rely on customers tipping in advance. ""I'm raised old school. You get tips for doing good service"" she said.

""In my opinion I would just prefer the companies paid more.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydHNrZWVkYS5jb20vbmZsL25ld3Mtd2F0Y2gtb2RlbGwtYmVrY2hhbS1qci1zdGFycy1oaWxhcmlvdXMtYWQtdWJlci1lYXRzLWV4cGxhaW5pbmctanVzdGluLWZpZWxkcy1uZXZlci1nb3QtOTAtb3JkZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WATCH: Odell Bekcham Jr. stars in hilarious new commercial for Uber Eats explaining why Justin Fields never got his ...,"Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields and NFL free agent Odell Beckham Jr. might not be connected to one another outside of the NFL. Yet they might be more connected especially after an incident involving the Bears quarterback and Uber Eats.

Fields had a tough time getting his meal from the food delivery service. In trying to bring levity to Fields' food ordeal the free-agent wide receiver shared a commercial for Uber Eats.

Beckham Jr. starred in the funny commercial for the company showing how his bling could blind someone delivering food. In the commercial the Super Bowl-winning wideout blinded actor Danny Trejo while driving a car and crashing into some boxes.

The former Ohio State star took to Twitter to share his displeasure which was later deleted:

The city of Chicago is very cold as the month of December. During this time there's an increase in deliveries with people staying in and not eating out. As a second-year quarterback he was probably eating and preparing for the Bears' Week 13 matchup versus the Green Bay Packers.

Will Justin Fields have a feast versus the Packers in Week 13?

While the Chicago Bears franchise quarterback didn't have his meal on time fans will expect Fields to deliver against the Packers in Week 13. The quarterback has faced Green Bay three times in his career. He's thrown for 468 yards three touchdowns and four interceptions.

Fields also has 187 yards and a touchdown against the Packers in his young career. Justin Fields faced the Packers back in Week 2 this season at Lambeau Field throwing for 70 yards on 11 attempts. He and the Bears lost that game by a 27-10 score.

The 70 yards passing in that Week 2 game still stands as the fewest yards thrown in a game this season. Chicago has a record of 3-9 and sits last in the NFC North as the Packers are slightly ahead with a 3-8 record. Let's see if Justin Fields can keep the Bears on time unlike his Uber Eats meal.

(AP) — When BNSF railroad conductor Justin Schaaf needed to take time off from work this summer he had to make a choice: go to the dentist to get a cavity in his molar filled or attend a party for his son’s 7th birthday.

He chose his son.

“Ultimately I decided to take the day off for my kid’s birthday party” Schaaf said. “Then when I am finally able to get into the dentist four five six months later the tooth is too bad to repair at that point so I have to get the tooth pulled out.”

Those are the kind of tradeoffs that railroad workers worry they might still have to make after Congress voted this week to impose a contract on them to avoid the economic disaster that would accompany a railroad strike. Workers and their unions say the deal didn’t do enough to address their quality-of-life concerns and didn’t add any sick days.

President Joe Biden signed a bill Friday to block a strike and force workers to accept the agreements union leaders made in September even though four of the 12 unions — which include a majority of rail workers — voted to reject them. Business groups had been urging Biden to intervene for weeks.

For Schaaf he’s not sure if the new contract will make it any easier to find another day off sometime next year to pay to have a fake tooth implanted in his mouth.

“If I had the option of taking a sick day … I would have never been in that situation” he said from his home in Glasgow Montana.

Schaaf said it was discouraging but not surprising to see Congress step in to settle the contract dispute ahead of next Friday’s strike deadline. Lawmakers have made a habit of stepping in to impose contracts when railroads and their unions reach the brink of a strike — 18 times since the passage of the 1926 Railway Labor Act by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s count — because of the potential economic consequences.

Many businesses rely on railroads to deliver raw materials and ship their final products so a rail strike would send a catastrophic ripple through the economy. Passenger railroads also would be disrupted because so many use tracks owned by the freight railroads.

The five-year deals that rail workers wound up with include 24% raises and $5000 in bonuses. But concerns about the lack of paid sick time and the demanding schedules that unions say make it hard for workers to ever take a day off dominated the contract talks. The rail unions say they weren’t able to get more concessions out of the railroads because the big companies knew Congress would intervene.

The railroads refused to add paid sick days to the deal at the end of three years of negotiations because they didn’t want to pay much more than a special board of arbitrators appointed by Biden recommended this summer. Plus the railroads say the unions have agreed over the years to forego paid sick leave in favor of higher wages and strong short-term disability benefits that kick in after as little as four days.

The railroads agreed to offer three unpaid days for engineers and conductors to tend to medical needs as long as they are scheduled at least 30 days in advance. They also promised to negotiate further to improve the way regular days off are scheduled to help workers better know when they will be off.

But to retired engineer Jeff Kurtz there is still a lot of work to be done to restore the quality of life he enjoyed before he left the railroad eight years ago. He doubts rail workers today would be able to get time off for key family events on short notice the way he did when he found out his son was getting his doctorate right before Christmas in 2009.

“You hear when you hire out on the railroad you’re going to miss some things. But you’re not supposed to miss everything” said Kurtz who remains active even in retirement with the Railroad Workers United coalition that includes workers from every union. “You shouldn’t miss your kids growing up. You shouldn’t miss the seminal moments in your family’s life.”

Over the past six years the major railroads have eliminated nearly one-third of their jobs as they overhauled operations making the work more demanding for those who remain.

The unions say they won’t stop fighting for more paid sick leave but now they may have to wait for negotiations on the next contract beginning in 2025.

The head of the Association of American Railroads trade group Ian Jefferies acknowledged “there is more to be done to further address our employees’ work-life balance concerns” but he said the compromise deals that Congress voted to impose should help make schedules more predictable while delivering the biggest raises rail workers have seen in more than four decades.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDIyLzEyLzMvYmhvcGFsLWRpc2FzdGVycy1wZXJwZXRyYXRvcnMtdXNlZC1kdW1teS1maXJtcy10by1rZWVwLWJpei1vbtIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL2Vjb25vbXkvMjAyMi8xMi8zL2Job3BhbC1kaXNhc3RlcnMtcGVycGV0cmF0b3JzLXVzZWQtZHVtbXktZmlybXMtdG8ta2VlcC1iaXotb24?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bhopal disaster’s perpetrators used ‘dummy’ firms to keep biz on,"New Delhi – Nearly three years after toxic gases from a Union Carbide Corporation’s (UCC) factory killed an estimated 15000 people and left more than half a million seriously ill in the Indian city of Bhopal a chemical trading firm – Visa Petrochemicals Private Limited – was incorporated in Mumbai.

Over the next 14 years Visa Petrochemicals became a linchpin in an elaborate plan by American chemical giant UCC to discreetly sell its products in India while it evaded criminal trial for spewing lethal gases that killed the residents of Bhopal on the midnight of December 2 1984. A Bhopal court had declared UCC’s then-CEO Warren Anderson a fugitive and ordered that the properties and products of UCC and its subsidiaries all of which were proclaimed offenders and absconders in India for not appearing in the criminal trial against them be seized.

Internal company records accessed by The Reporters’ Collective (TRC) for Al Jazeera now reveal that UCC discreetly sold its products to several firms owned by the federal and state governments and some large private corporations. Among them was a buyer from ground zero: a firm owned by the government of Madhya Pradesh the state whose capital Bhopal saw one of the world’s worst industrial disasters. The firm was a joint venture partner in a cable company that bought UCC products.

To create a discreet backdoor into India where the public saw it as the devil of Bhopal and courts were going after it UCC and its associates floated three firms one each in India the United States and Singapore. In its internal records Carbide employees called them “front” and “dummy” companies. At times they referred to these companies as their “extended arms”. These firms took orders from Indian customers on UCC’s behalf relabelled its products routed them through multiple ports and supplied them to customers. The company sold materials that went into the making of household products ranging from telephone cables to paints.

UCC internally admitted that the dummy companies were “a legal requirement” to help it keep its “distance from India”. This admission was made in an internal business plan for UCC to keep selling its goods in India even after the Indian court had ordered the seizure of all its moveable and immovable assets in the country. The court did not explicitly declare the future sale of UCC products illegal. But it had ordered that all its assets be seized including products and goods meant for sale.

The government companies that traded with UCC knew about this backdoor arrangement as UCC privately informed them when its front company participated in tenders.

This backdoor arrangement continued until 2002 a year after American giant Dow Chemical bought all assets of Carbide for $9.3bn. The period saw Union governments led by both the main Indian parties Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Between 1995 and 2000 the company sold more than 55800 tonnes of wires and cables in the Indian market according to records. In 1999 alone the company sold products worth $24m through this arrangement.

While media in India had reported that Dow relabelled UCC’s products and sold them in the country through a front company for a year the group’s elaborate discreet channels – the network of front and dummy companies – and information on UCC customers including government corporations that knowingly bought products through this shadowy channel had been buried so far. Information on the people behind the dummy companies and their workings – active for almost 14 years – is being published for the first time.

The fountainhead of these revelatory records are documents submitted in a US court hearing when Dow UCC and its dummy companies got into litigation over the pricing of products in the early 2000s and submitted evidence of their relationships.

The collective sent detailed queries to UCC and Dow but did not receive a response.

Lethal business

It was the death of a technician from phosgene poisoning on a cold Christmas eve in 1981 that first foretold an impending catastrophe and revealed cracks in the UCC factory in Bhopal. UCC’s global profits had plummeted 90 percent in the three years preceding the disaster. Its India unit could sell less than half its production capacity of Sevin a “miracle insecticide” born on the banks of the Hudson and reborn in India on the sands of Narmada.

Layoffs took hold and cost-cutting affected safety and maintenance protocols in the Bhopal plant. On the night of the disaster the safety valves and alarm systems of the tank that stored the lethal chemicals including the lethal methyl isocyanate used in the production of Sevin did not work. Some were dysfunctional others were turned off since malfunctioning alarms would repeatedly go off in the leaky plant.

“I remember that night” said 60-year-old Leelabai who lives in Bhopal’s JP Nagar located near the disaster site. At a distance overlooking her one-room house is the metallic carcass of the factory.

“I remember it like yesterday. Our eyes burned and people began vomiting. There was a stampede” she said tearing up. A deadly fog had filled nearby slums. Death struck in seconds and no one was prepared.

Leelabai and her husband were the only survivors in the family. Her three children died over the years as their health debilitated. “Our lives are worse than death” she said.

“None of us knew they had chemicals this dangerous” Savitribai another resident of JP Nagar told TRC.

More than 2000 people died over the following days after breathing a cocktail of deadly fumes one being hydrocyanic acid a chemical that causes a series of reactions leading to loss of blood flow to the brain and resulting in immediate death.

As per estimates by survivors’ groups 13000 people died over the next few years from damaged lungs brains kidneys and nervous and immune systems. Hundreds were disabled for life. The poisonous chemicals polluted (PDF) Bhopal’s soil and water for decades causing a perpetual health tragedy for residents.

Three days after the disaster when Anderson – still one of the West’s most powerful industrial leaders – visited India he was placed under house arrest in UCC’s luxury guesthouse over charges including culpable homicide causing death by negligence. Three hours later Anderson whose factory poisoned a city was released on a bail of 25000 rupees (about $300 at the current exchange rate). Within 24 hours he was mysteriously flown out of Bhopal in state Chief Minister Arjun Singh’s jet and then to the US in the company’s plane. Anderson never returned. He never faced trial. And died peacefully in 2014 aged 92 on US soil where he rose from a salesman in UCC to its CEO.

UCC was still the US’s third-largest chemical manufacturer and 37th among the top 50 US companies in 1984. The Bhopal accident was bad for business. It was a public relations nightmare and would run up several millions in legal costs. UCC had to find a way to continue trade. Who would help the company move past this?

The spin-off

For up to two years after the disaster UCC did its business in India as usual despite protests and outrage from survivors and activists. In December 1987 India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed charges against Anderson UCC and its subsidiary that oversaw Asia operations Union Carbide Eastern which was incorporated in Delaware US. By then UCC had set in motion a series of events that would help retain its grip on the Indian market while keeping a safe distance from courts. The first among them was the birth of Visa Petrochemical Limited.

The company was a “spin off from UCIL [Union Carbide India Limited]” said Visa Petrochemical’s Annual Business Plans submitted to the UCC in 1994. Ravi Muthukrishnan the then India country manager of Dow Chemical noted in an email to his bosses in 2001 that Visa Petrochemical was formed by former UCC employees engaged in “international trade” after the “government advised them to exit totally out of India”. He also noted that Visa whose name was changed to MegaVisa Marketing and Solutions in 1999 was UCC’s “extended arm” into India.

UCC signed an agreement with Visa Petrochemical on 14 November 1987 15 days before the CBI filed charges against the former and designated the new company its “non-exclusive distributor in India”. The arrangement allowed UCC to route its products through Visa. Under the contract Visa’s “duty” was to “canvas and promote sales” of UCC products. It was to do all this while “representing” UCC. The latter’s business could now proceed without the taint of its past.

In the next few years UCC incorporated a new subsidiary – Carbide Asia Pacific – in Delaware which slowly took over the operations of Carbide Eastern an accused party in the Bhopal case. This ensured UCC’s Asia businesses including the agreement with Visa Petrochemicals in India were carried out by a firm not named in the case.

In 1989 UCC paid $470m as compensation for the disaster in response to the civil lawsuit which the survivors’ representatives said was a meagre $500 for each victim and one-sixth of the compensation initially claimed by the government. But the government accepted the proposal without consulting the victims.

In 1992 after all the foreign parties who were accused evaded Indian courts in the criminal lawsuit Bhopal’s chief judicial magistrate seized all of UCC’s moveable and immovable properties in India. It did so after noting: “The accused Union Carbide USA wants to evade the prosecution going on in this court by transferring its properties in India by any means.” The magistrate labelled Anderson UCC (parent company based in the US) and Union Carbide Eastern as “absconders”.

For UCC continuing trade now would be tougher and more complicated than before. UCC and its affiliates had to come up with a new plan.

New partners

In February 1994 a young businessman called Ajay Mittal from Mumbai met UCC officials in Danbury to discuss the shipment of its products. The officials found the meeting with Mittal “excellent” and “frank” as per a fax sent by UCC officials to Mittal a day after their meeting a copy of which was submitted in court documents.

Mittal an American business school graduate is an heir to the realty business family Mittal Group and currently owns and runs Arshiya Limited a logistics and supply chain firm. A 2001 Dow India internal report described his family as a “fairly established group” that owns more than 3000 buildings in Mumbai.

After the court declared UCC an “absconder” and seized its India assets Mittal’s businesses proved crucial in fulfilling Carbide’s “legal requirement to distance from India” reveal company documents.

Mittal owned a firm in Houston called Mega Global Services which was set up in March 1993 documents show. A month later Carbide Asia Pacific terminated its contract with Visa Petrochemicals and on the same day signed a new agreement with Mega Global.

Mega Global Services’ role according to the new contract was to first buy UCC products and resell them to “customers located in India”. UCC’s products would be relabelled as that of Mega Global Services in this process.

Mittal did not stop there. Two months after the meeting in Houston he bought an 89.5 percent stake in Visa Petrochemical. His group now owned both the intermediaries crucial to UCC’s backdoor channel. Mittal UCC and Visa Petrochemicals worked out Carbide products’ route into India which was laid out in an annual business plan of Visa Petrochemical.

Visa Petrochemical would scout for customers. It would pass on formal price queries from potential customers to both Mega Global Services and Union Carbide Asia Pacific. They in turn sent them to the parent UCC which would send the prices to Carbide Asia Pacific. The Asia-Pacific unit would further send that information to Visa Petrochemical which sent it to the customer.

If the buyer agreed it would place the order with Mega Global Services. UCC would sell the product to Mega Global Services. UCC would arrange a third-party transporter known as a “freight forwarder” to ship the goods to the customer according to the agreement. Visa Petrochemical would sign off on an indent – a document listing out the products imported – for the customer.

While the product originated from UCC warehouses the seller on documents given at the Indian port was Mega Global Services for which it earned a commission.

Mega Global Services was referred to as a “front party as a conduit” in internal correspondence. The majority of Mega Global Services’ business revolved around buying and then shipping UCC products as their own.

In 1998 it was replaced by a Singapore firm with a similar name – MegaVisa Solutions Pte Ltd. This too was owned by the Mittal Group.

A July 2001 email by a Dow India manager to his bosses in the US says “MegaVisa Singapore entity was set up to take care of the post-Bhopal situation and is essentially a shell company.”

MegaVisa Singapore bought UCC products in the US “took title to them there and then arranged to ship the products to our customers from there” Sanjiv Sanghvi director at the Singapore firm submitted in a testimony to the US court in 2002.

This Mittal-owned network of “extended arms” and “shells” would ensure UCC’s products continued to be sold in the Indian market from 1993 to 2002. And among its customers were firms owned by the Indian government – the very party that was suing it for causing death and injuries to its citizens.

Government clients

Among UCC’s customers were wholly government-owned firms such as Gas Authority of India Ltd Hindustan Photo Films Manufacturing Company Ltd and Hindustan Cables. Lubrizol India then an equal joint venture between federal government-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and American chemical company Lubrizol was also a customer.

Companies promoted by the governments of Gujarat (Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd) Tamil Nadu (Indian Additives Ltd) and Madhya Pradesh (Vindhya Telelinks Ltd) also bought UCC’s products through the channel. The list of customers also includes more than 150 private firms including Reliance Industries Sterlite Industries Finolex Cables Crompton Greaves Berger Paints and Castrol India.

Many of UCC’s buyers clearly knew who they were shaking hands with. Documents show UCC informed Oil and Natural Gas Company (ONGC) and IOC that the Houston-based Mega Global Services would bid on its behalf for a tender floated by the public sector companies.

“We hereby authorise Mega Global Services to quote against the above [ONGC’s] tender” reads a letter dated November 16 1994 by Carbide Asia Pacific to ONGC’s general manager. Visa Petrochemical’s 1994 Annual Business Plan notes that the company managed a “breakthrough on TEG with ONGC”. TEG or triethylene glycol is a plasticiser chemical for which ONGC invited sellers.

“If MM Global Services is successful in winning the tender” UCC’s December 1999 letter to IOC reads “Union Carbide Corporation will supply the quantity required and the product supplied will meet all the requirements of our specification.”

MegaVisa Singapore submitted a July 2001 sales invoice for an order for methyl isobutyl carbinol worth $77656 by Lubrizol India. Lubrizol India was jointly owned by IOC and Lubrizol.

Visa Petrochemicals which changed its name to MegaVisa Marketing and Solutions worked closely with India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT). “MegaVisa is working with DoT to improve OIT test in the specification” reads one of Visa’s emails to Dow. OIT or oxidative induction time refers to a test to figure out the thermal stability of a wire.

UCC’s Indian front in fact had some level of influence on the government. An internal communication from MegaVisa to Dow from 2001 for example states that “with a lot of groundwork” the company managed to convince the Indian telecom department (DoT) to float a tender for the purchase of a cable product. This is a product that UCC through MegaVisa was supplying to the Indian market. “We need technical support from Dow [the US-based chemical giant had at this point taken over Union Carbide] to push DoT and Utilities for upgradation of specifications” it says in the same note.

“Even in this time of extreme turmoil & hostile environment for our team we have continued to work with DoT” Mittal said in an email to a UCC official on May 5 2000. He also notes that MegaVisa’s work with DoT will help “drive out smaller players”. “As we go ahead we are confident of achieving better volumes and better netbacks for UCC” he wrote.

Correspondence from two private firms – Sterlite and Finolex – show they too knew they were buying UCC products. Both firms sent legal notices to UCC and its subsidiary in the US and Sterlite even filed a civil suit against the company after some orders they placed with UCC’s Houston-based front company Mega Global did not come through. The companies eventually settled the case out of court.

Mittal did not respond to queries from Al Jazeera. An Indian Oil Corporation spokesperson said the company “did not have any comments about the trailing communication”. All the other government and private firms that traded with Carbide’s front companies including the DoT did not respond to Al Jazeera’s queries.

Dow’s takeover

In February 2001 Dow bought UCC. Soon activists demanded that the company come clean on why its fully owned subsidiary never faced trial and pay additional compensation to victims. Dow refused to take ownership of UCC’s liabilities arguing that it never owned the Bhopal plant and that the latter is a separate legal entity.

However Dow also continued trading UCC’s products for a year using its intermediary companies. But it was keen to mask its link to UCC. An email by the company’s public affairs director in March 2001 reads “Reporters will be tempted to keep talking about Union Carbide. But we should discourage reporters from using the words Union Carbide unless it’s a reference to a historical activity.”

In January 2002 Dow (India) informed MegaVisa that it would no longer be the distributor of most UCC products. By this time feedback from at least one Indian customer Berger Paints on MegaVisa’s personnel was not positive – referring to them as “non-committal” documents show. Additionally Dow’s India officials internally recommended that “major customers should be handled directly by Dow”.

MegaVisa in turn held Dow responsible for its losses. A year later Houston- and Singapore-based MegaVisa firms filed a case against Dow and UCC on “antitrust” grounds in the US Connecticut District Court. The MegaVisa firms alleged Dow had gone back on its contractual obligations and hampered its profits.

Dow eventually settled with the Mittal-owned firms out of court including the businesses in Houston Singapore and India. The details of the settlement are not known. UCC’s Indian front MegaVisa filed for liquidation in 2010. Its finances reflect a company that was suffering losses.

The same year the then Congress-led federal government moved India’s top court to change its 1989 order setting the compensation for the disaster’s victims. In its petition it asked the Supreme Court to reconsider that amount and demand additional compensation jointly from UCC Dow and Union Carbide India Limited. At the time the victims’ representatives also demanded that the “corporate veil” of UCC its subsidiaries and Dow be lifted. The case pending for more than a decade was last heard in October 2022 in which the Supreme Court asked the government to include the victims’ demands in its representation.

UCC's access to Indian markets continued unabated through a Mumbai-based chemical trading firm Visa Petrochemicals Private Limited.

The investigation found out Visa Petrochemicals sold UCC's products for around 14 years while the parent company was evading ""criminal trials for spewing lethal gases that killed the residents of Bhopal on the midnight of December 2 1984. At the same time a Bhopal Court had declared Warren Anderson UCC's then CEO a fugitive and ordered a seizure of the properties and products of UCC and its subsidiaries.

However the court order did not stop UCC from selling its products to various state and Central government firms and some large private corporations. Surprisingly even a Madhya Pradesh-based government firm the state where the disaster happened all bought UCC products.

The firms established to continue its business in India by UCC were called ""front"" and ""dummy"" companies. The main task of these firms was to take orders from Indian customers on behalf of UCC relabel the products route them through multiple ports and supply them to the customers. While the company's assets were seized after the court order it was not explicitly prohibited from selling its products and goods.

The government firms who bought UCC products were aware of this backdoor arrangement which continued until 2002 ""a year after American giant Dow Chemicals bought all asserts of Carbide for $9.3bn. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress governed during that period in India.

Visa Petrochemicals and UCC signed an agreement for the former to become the latter's ""non-exclusive distributive in India"" in November 1987; this happened as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was about to file charges against UCC. The agreement required Visa Petrochemical to ""canvas and promoted sales"" of UCC products. Following that UCC incorporated a new subsidiary- Carbide Asia Pacific- to ensure that its Asia businesses were carried out by a firm not named in the case.

The company and Anderson were declared ""absconders"" by a Bhopal court in 1992 for evading criminal lawsuits.

""The accused Union Carbide USA wants to evade the prosecution going on in this court by transferring its properties in India by any means"" the court noted. The order made it difficult for UCC to carry out its backdoor operations. However Ajay Mittal a businessman from Mumbai met UCC officials in February 1994 and proved crucial in fulfilling UCC's ""legal requirements to distance from India."" Mittal started the Mega Global Services firm to buy UCC products and resell them to Indian customers. After the firm was established UCC revoked its agreement with Visa Petrochemicals and signed a new one with Mega Global Services. This continued till 1998 when the firm was replaced by MegaVisa Solutions Pte Ltd. also owned by Mittal.

During these 14 years many government-owned firms such as Gas Authority of India Ltd Hindustan Photo Films Manufacturing Company Ltd and Hindustan Cables were actively involved in business with UCC's backdoor firms. Not only that the subsidiary firms operated with a degree of influence within the ranks of the government. For example in 2002 MegaVisa ""managed to convince the Indian telecom department (DoT) to float a tender for the purchase of a cable product.""

All of these backdoor deals were happening as UCC was refusing to pay compensation to the victims of the Bhopal disaster. The compensation it eventually paid was 1/6th of the compensation demanded by the government. A case related to the Bhopal tragedy is still going on in the Supreme Court; as victims were denied justice UCC carried on business-as-usual.",,,,,,

However the Trucking Transport Business Act which implements this safe rate system is temporary and excludes drivers not in the container and cement industries. In response the trucker’s union has gone on strike for the second time within six months demanding a permanent guarantee of minimum freight charges as well as application of the system to truckers driving oil and chemical tankers steel and automobile carriers and package delivery trucks. Unfortunately the administration has refused to comply. In recent negotiations between the striking trucker’s union and the South Korean government workers were warned that they could receive penalties such as canceled licenses up to three years in jail or a fine of up to 30 million won (approximately $31000 C.A.D.) if they do not return to work immediately. Many truckers have shaved their heads in protest.

The People Power Party and the Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport decided to extend the Trucking Transport Business Act which was set to terminate at the end of this year by another three years but have chosen not to permanently increase the minimum rates or to include truckers from other industries.

“If safe rates are applied to those truckers the public will have to take on more of the logistics cost burden” Sung said. “To minimize public burden we have decided to not expand the system to other freight types.”

This harsh sentence is because South Korea’s economy is expected to slow to 1.7% growth next year down from previous forecasts of 2.1%. However the 25000 striking truckers – 10% of whom work in the cement industry – argue that the minimum charges are essential for safety reasons. About 700 people die in truck accidents every year many of them due to speeding or exhaustion. If adequate minimum wages are provided truckers won’t be forced to drive as dangerously.

The government may have financial concerns but if it fails to handle the strikers’ safety concerns South Korea’s trucking system is likely to see further collective action. Rather than complying with the striking truckers the government has chosen to threaten them back into line. We will have to see how that decision will play out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhbG1iZWFjaGRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyLzA0L3BhbG0tYmVhY2gtY291cGxlLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtNzUteWVhcnMtbWFycmlhZ2UvMTA4MTA4MDAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palm Beach couple celebrates 75 years of marriage,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.palmbeachdailynews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/news/2022/12/04/palm-beach-couple-celebrates-75-years-marriage/10810800002/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C48FEF3D00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhbG1iZWFjaGRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEyLzA0L3BhbG0tYmVhY2gtY291cGxlLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtNzUteWVhcnMtbWFycmlhZ2UvMTA4MTA4MDAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

As of Jan. 1 2023 Michigan rental operators of “qualified heavy equipment rental property” or QHERPP will be exempt from paying ad valorem taxes. Instead they will be required to collect a specific tax that will be assessed an amount equal to 2 percent of the rental price.

This change which rental operators in Michigan have spent years lobbying for is a result of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signing into law on March 23 2022 Public Act 46 which created an exemption for those rental operators.

According to the Michigan State Tax Commission a “qualified renter” must claim the exemption annually by filing the approved form with their local assessor/assessing unit — city or township — where the rental business is located by Feb. 20 2023.

A “qualified renter” is defined as an individual corporation limited liability company partnership association or any other legal entity that meets all the following criteria:

Is engaged in a line of business described in Code 532412 (Construction Mining and Forestry Machinery and Equipment Rental and Leasing) or 532310 (General Rental Centers) of the North American Industry Classification System published by the United States Census Bureau 2017 edition. ARA members other than those in the event rental industry typically rent this equipment in their operations.

Maintains in this state a qualified renter business location. Claimants must report both the real parcel number of the rental business location where the equipment is kept when not rented out as well as the personal property numbers under which the equipment is reported.

Receives more than 50 percent of its annual gross receipts from the rental of qualified equipment to the public or has an affiliate that receives more than 50 percent of the affiliate’s annual gross receipts from the rental of such equipment to the public.

Equipment qualifying for the exemption includes any construction earthmoving or industrial equipment that is mobile and rented to customers by a qualified renter including attachments or other equipment. It does not include handheld tools or equipment solely for industry-specific uses in oil and gas exploration mining or forestry. A more specific list of qualified equipment can be found here.

Once qualified for the new exemption qualifying personal property will be exempt from ad valorem taxes and rental operators will instead need to collect the specific tax as outlined in Public Act 35 of 2022.

For definition of terms used on the form go to the Instruction for Form 5819.

Note that all bulletins and forms are available on the State Tax Commission’s website. Forms needed are:

“As of now the Biden administration is dangerously silent on the single biggest line item in Americans’ budgets: their rent” says Tara Raghuveer a Kansas City–based tenant advocate and director of the People’s Action Homes Guarantee campaign. Her group brought one hundred tenants to both the White House and Congress last month calling for an executive order that would slow the skyrocketing increases in the cost of rent.

Tenant housing and legal advocacy groups have even drafted the order for Biden to sign. It calls for rent control in all properties backed by federally guaranteed mortgages and in all cities and states that apply for federal block grant funding along with investigations and prosecutions for rent price gouging as an unfair and deceptive practice prohibited by federal law. Together these provisions would impact tens of millions of US renter households.

Fast and dramatic action is called for as rents have risen to historic levels. Rents went up nationally 14 percent in 2021 and over 20 percent in several cities. Continued increases this year pulled the average US rent above $2000 per month for the first time. Even before these hikes the vast majority of renter households with extremely low incomes were paying over 50 percent of their income for rent. One in six tenants report being behind on their rent and evictions are rising along with rent prices.

Meanwhile corporate landlords are tightening their grip on the nation’s rental market. Institutional owners — corporations or limited liability companies — now own the majority of all US rental units and over 80 percent of properties with twenty-five or more units. They are well aware of what that market control lets them get away with.

Bob Nicolls CEO of one of America’s top corporate landlords Monarch Investment and Management Group told investors in September 2021 that big rent hikes were coming. “We have an unprecedented opportunity . . . to really press rents” Nicolls said. “Where are people going to go? They can’t go anywhere.”

Sure enough the top-ten publicly traded corporate landlords many of whom share access to anticompetitive algorithms to keep rents artificially high collectively saw their profits rise by 57 percent last year.

With housing costs being far and away the largest expense for US households rent spikes are a key driver of inflation which midterm voters cited as their top concern. But the Biden administration has done virtually nothing to control the cost of rent. The American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act did not lower housing costs and the Inflation Reduction Act stripped out the housing investments in the doomed Build Back Better legislation. Biden’s proposal to increase housing supply is a worthy long-term goal but does nothing to relieve the emergencies being experienced by millions of households every month when the rent comes due.

An executive order would fill that gap. The order proposed by People’s Action and collaborating organizations would include:

The Federal Housing Finance Agency mandating that tenants in all properties financed by government-backed mortgages be protected by rent increase regulations that cap annual increases at 1.5 times the Consumer Price Index or 3 percent whichever is lower. This would apply to over 12 million rental units nearly 30 percent of US rental stock.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development requiring that states and cities applying for coveted Community Development Block Grants institute similar rent control.

The Federal Trade Commission adding excessive rent increases to its list of unfair and deceptive practices that could lead to enforcement actions.

The US Department of the Treasury clarifying that good cause is required for eviction and nonrenewal of leases in properties funded by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.

Aggressive federal action would reflect the changed landscape for tenants who once dealt with mom-and-pop local landlords now forced to confront the power of national and even multinational corporations.

“Increasingly the real estate market is run by institutional investors who have consolidated the market” Raghuveer says. “These are multistate or even multinational actors that can’t be effectively regulated by local or state policy alone. “

These corporate landlords turn to the federal government to prop up their operations. “The business model of many of these real estate investors is to get government-backed mortgages through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a tax credit from the Treasury Department or support from HUD [Department of Housing and Urban Development] or the Department of Agriculture” Raghuveer says. “So we see it as an absolute necessity that the federal government actually use those public subsidies and financing as leverage to increase the power position of the tenant relative to the landlord.”

The pressure on Biden to act is following the blueprint of successful recent campaigns pushing for executive action on student debt and drug policy. And the campaign has the support of national legal organizations and experts who argue that the president has the legal authority to take major steps to ease the housing crisis.

“Millions of tenants around the US live under the constant threat of eviction and displacement” says Brandon Weiss a housing law professor at American University Washington College of Law. “This draft executive order contains a number of common sense provisions that would provide them with some basic legal protections.

“While landlord tenant law has traditionally been addressed under state and local law there is significant authority and precedent for the federal government to regulate this area as well” Weiss says. “For example as the draft executive order proposes there is ample room for a more expansive approach to how the US Department of Housing and Urban Development interprets the duty to affirmatively further fair housing under the Fair Housing Act.”

Precedent for federal housing regulation includes the federal rent control imposed on 80 percent of US housing in World War II recent pandemic protections for tenants in housing with government-backed mortgages and a host of longtime anti-eviction and pricing requirements on federally subsidized housing. So it is well within Biden’s power to issue an executive order as an overdue response to the will of a worried public: August polling by Data for Progress showed a majority of US voters support Biden using his executive power to address the housing crisis with a full 76 percent of Democrats calling for presidential action.

That level of public support comes as no surprise to Raghuveer or the coalition of more than 250 organizations calling for executive action. “The rent is just too damn high” says Raghuveer. “It’s been that way for decades but this is a new level of crisis now.”",,,,,,

We found 91 transmission events reported in the published medical literature from 16 EU/EEA countries and the UK over a 15 year period from 2006 to 2021. A range of setting types were implicated with most events occurring through blood transfusions or in dialysis units. A number of outbreaks occurred in seemingly low risk settings such as CT/MRI scanning units.

Outbreaks in inpatient settings accounted for half of all reported events. Inpatient settings tend to report a higher number of nosocomial infections than outpatients (where patients are not admitted overnight) which is likely due to various factors including the complexity of healthcare delivery in inpatient settings frequency of medical procedures and better monitoring and reporting systems in place [12].

Events classified as ‘multi setting blood products’ which includes all transfusion related events accounted for a large proportion of outbreaks identified in published studies. This was included as a separate category as the majority of studies describing transfusion related infections did not specify a setting for transmission. Note that publications on studies of transmission through blood products use a look-back approach where registries of past transfusions from identified infected donors are retrospectively screened. These specific studies allow for active case-finding over large periods of time. This means that the large proportion of transmission events compared to other settings is likely due to both publication bias and the high sensitivity of this type of investigation. Even as transmission events can still be identified related to blood transfusion dedicated studies have demonstrated that blood transfusions have become significantly safer with the introduction of robust blood screening protocols [13 14].

Consistent with findings from previous research [15] many outbreaks (18%) occurred in dialysis units and all except one were related to HCV. It is not clear why the outbreaks in dialysis units were mostly due to HCV but this could be attributed to protection of these patients from HBV from the widespread rollout of immunisation [16]. However the challenge of achieving good vaccine response in end-stage renal disease patients is well recognised [17] and similar hepatitis B and C incidence has been documented among dialysis patients in some settings [18]. Therefore we cannot exclude some publication bias to account for our findings.

Events in dialysis units were reported from across many countries. Bloodborne infections are well recognised as an important hazard in dialysis units and prevalence of HCV among dialysis patients is generally higher than the general population [19]. The interplay between dialysis and the risk of bloodborne infections is complex but the potential risk is great due to frequent vascular access poor immune function and malnutrition among dialysis patients as well as the inherent risks of prolonged inpatient stays [20].

The majority of reported outbreaks in dialysis units were attributed to breaches in standard IPC measures such as cross-contamination from equipment or surfaces. IPC breaches included staff not consistently changing gloves and washing hands between patients incomplete disinfection of surfaces and unsafe injection practises such as the use of multidose vials [212223]. There has been substantial progress to mitigate the risk of nosocomial outbreaks among dialysis units through the implementation of ‘universal’ or ‘standard’ precautions for preventing bloodborne virus (BBV) transmission [24] and reductions in prevalence have followed strict enforcement of IPC measures. For example a prospective study of over 1700 haemodialysis units in Belgium found a reduction in HCV prevalence from 13.5% in 1991 to 6.8% in 2000 with a similar trend reported in five other European countries (France Sweden Italy the UK and Hungary) [25]. Despite this dialysis units remain a key setting for hepatitis transmission and strict enforcement of standard precautions periodic audits of practice and regular staff training are all essential.

The need for strengthening IPC procedures and staff training is also evidenced by occasional outbreaks in other inpatients settings as outbreaks occurred across multiple types of wards as well as in nursing homes. Although the exact mechanism of transmission was sometimes unclear investigations revealed various deficiencies such as the multiple use of disposable needles [23] surface contamination of shared equipment [25] or non-compliance with basic hand hygiene [25].

Infections related to surgery accounted for the highest number of events where transmission occurred from an infected healthcare worker (HCW) to a patient with six outbreaks identified. This is consistent with other research showing that most outbreaks related to HCWs occur as a result of transmission during surgery [26]. One outbreak occurred in primary care in which a primary care physician in Belgium unknowingly infected 32 patients with HBV through unsafe infection practises demonstrating the extent of transmission that can occur from an infected HCW [27]. For HCV infected HCWs the guidance is clear as the treatment for those infected involves a straightforward regime of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to clear the infection [28] but policies for HBV positive HCWs varies among countries. The CDC recommends treating some HBV infected HCWs with antiviral therapy even if they do not fulfil the typical indications for treatment to reduce the possibility of transmission during exposure prone procedures (EPPs) to patients [29]. Regular screening and vaccination of HCWs (particularly those performing EPPs) in combination with IPC training is essential in order to avoid harm to patients as well as protect staff from occupationally acquired infections [30]. Finally settings that are not often recognised as risky areas for nosocomial outbreaks were also identified with 7% of outbreaks (six in total) occurring in CT/MRI scanning units. Half of these outbreaks related to the unsafe use of contrast media injections resulting in transmission between patients and the other half were unidentified. Automatic injectors used for IV administration of contrast agents during CT/MRI scanning have previously been highlighted as an important IPC risk in radiology units [31]. Strict adherence to disinfection procedures as well as regular training on the use of automatic injectors is therefore needed to reduce the risk of contamination.

Whilst suboptimal practice in IPC accounted for the majority of transmission events transmission through blood products was the second most commonly reported over the period of the study with stable trends over time. Historically transfusion associated hepatitis was a major cause of HBV and HCV infections; during the 1960’s the risk of acquiring hepatitis from a single transfusion was estimated at 30% [32]. Since then the risk in Europe has been drastically reduced by strict EU legislation mandating the use of risk based assessments for donors and screening of blood products including viral nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HBV and HCV [33]. A particular benefit of NAT screening is the ability to detect occult HBV infection (OBI) defined as the presence of detectable HBV DNA in individuals who are HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative [34]. All EU/EEA countries now have robust haemovigilance systems in place and screen donations using quality assured methods [35]. This quality control of blood products has had a major impact on reducing the incidence of transfusion associated infections including hepatitis [36].

Nowadays the safety of blood products is related to the incidence of HBV and HCV with residual risk connected to transfusion of blood from a donor in the window period for NAT [37]. In addition there has been growing evidence of HBV transmission from donors with OBI [38 39] although our review was not able to assess the extent of this issue among the events reported. OBI prevalence correlates with HBV prevalence in the population of blood donors; a 2017 systematic review found the prevalence of chronic HBV infection among first-time blood donors ranged from 0 to 3.2% across 30 European countries and the prevalence of anti-HCV ranged from 0 to 2.2% [40]. This review found higher HBsAg and anti-HCV prevalence rates in the Eastern and Southern part of the EU/EEA compared to the West indicating higher residual risk in Eastern and Southern parts of Europe. Conversely we found that most blood product related transmission events were reported from Western European countries although this may be explained by reporting and/or publication bias.

Capillary blood sampling (CBS) devices were implicated in one haematology/oncology unit event and in all nursing home events except for two which could not identify the transmission pathway. Eight events involving CBS devices and the transmission of HBV were reported from just four countries (the UK Germany Italy and the Netherlands) between 2001 and 2007. Research suggests that HBV outbreaks in nursing homes are influenced by two conditions: the fact that HBV infections in the elderly are often asymptomatic and that nursing homes are settings of regular glucose monitoring for diabetic residents which inherently carries a risk of patient-to-patient transmission unless strict precautions are followed [41]. Transmission of BBVs through non-disposable multi-patient lancet devices has been extensively documented [42 43] which has led to a shift towards the use of disposable lancets in healthcare settings for monitoring glucose levels of diabetic patients with clear guidance that fingerstick devices should never be used for more than one patient [44]. The articles included in this review are likely to underestimate the true scale of the problem but reassuringly we found no articles recording CBS devices as the transmission mechanism after 2007 which perhaps reflects the increased awareness and widespread implementation of related guidance.

Lastly use of multidose vials was identified as an important cause of transmission accounting for 4% of all events. One article from Italy reports an HCV outbreak involving two ward nurses on a haematology/oncology unit infecting five patients through the repeated use of multidose saline flushes during the rinsing of CVC’s (central venous catheters) [45]. Similarly an outbreak in a thalassaemia outpatients department in Italy resulted in four clusters of HCV infections related to multidose vials [46]. Research suggests that HCV can be transferred via sterile needles and syringes into medication vials if the diaphragm is contaminated with enough quantity of HCV and the virus remains stable in several commonly used medications [47]. In the 1990’s nosocomial HCV outbreaks attributed to poor injection practises resulted in the US CDC to develop the ‘One and Only’ campaign which advocated the use of ‘one syringe one needle at one time’ [48]. Despite this multidose vials continue to be widely used in certain specialties such as nuclear medicine where they are needed to reduce the operator’s radiation exposure when making up vials of radioactive product [49]. The WHO has developed specific guidance on multidose vials in order to reduce unsafe injection practises associated with their use [50].

The countries reporting the highest number of events were Italy Germany and the UK. There is some evidence of a geographical gradient with fewer outbreaks reported from countries in Eastern Europe compared to the West and outbreaks reported from Eastern European countries were larger in size. Various factors may explain this finding such as a variation in local reporting and surveillance practises as well as differing practises around publishing events in the literature. In addition differences in the underlying epidemiology of hepatitis across regions may also have an impact with HBV and HCV prevalence highest among countries in the South and Eastern part of Europe [51].

The WHO acknowledges that most countries lack robust surveillance systems for detecting healthcare associated infections (HAI) and those that do often struggle with the lack of standardised criteria for diagnosing infections [52]. In 2004 the WHO Regional Office for Europe issued recommendations for countries to establish minimum standards of infection control and a surveillance system to monitor HAI through processes and outcome indicators [53]. Since then the ECDC has established HAI-NET a European network for the surveillance of healthcare associated infections that coordinates the European point prevalence survey of HAI and antimicrobial use [54]. The future inclusion of hepatitis specific indicators as part of this surveillance could be considered to provide further information on the scale nosocomial transmission of hepatitis across the EU/EEA.

One of the key limitations of using a systematic literature review to obtain an overview of nosocomial transmission is the publication bias that limits comparisons between countries. Some countries have more robust surveillance systems and public health resources to identify investigate and report nosocomial transmission events than others. Undoubtedly published studies account for a small proportion of all detected outbreaks and in addition the long incubation period and typically asymptomatic course of infection for acute HBV and HCV further complicate detection of outbreaks. The true burden of nosocomial transmission is clearly higher than documented by surveillance data reported to the ECDC notwithstanding the incompleteness of these data. Importantly we identified nosocomial outbreaks even in countries that are not able to report transmission routes for the surveillance data.

Differences between countries and outbreak settings are often difficult to interpret as included studies use different study designs case ascertainment methods and even laboratory tests. In addition outbreak investigations involving epidemiological techniques and phylogenetic analysis are the strongest sources of evidence included in this review. Studies reporting phylogenetic analysis made up the bulk of all included papers followed by those not reporting phylogenetic analysis and finally lookback investigations. Phylogenetic analysis should be recommended although resources for such investigations may not always be available which can make it challenging to confirm hepatitis B or C transmission events [55]. Look-backs are comprehensive investigations that demand a great deal of time and resources which may explain why we only found these in a few countries. Due to the inclusive nature of our search which also captured conference abstracts forensic investigations and court cases our results were derived from a range of sources with data presented in a range of different formats. Due to this heterogeneity it was not feasible to apply a standardised risk of bias assessment tool across the included studies. This highlights the need for greater standardisation in the reporting of healthcare-associated infections in order to allow for valid comparisons between studies.

There is a clear need to encourage consistent reporting of nosocomial transmission events across the EU/EEA. Currently there is variability in surveillance practice and combined with insufficient data this limits meaningful comparisons across the region [56]. The development of clear indicators and standardised methodological approaches for the reporting of suspected healthcare related transmission events are needed. The Outbreak Database (a worldwide database for nosocomial outbreaks supported by the Charité—University Medicine Berlin) [57] is a source of information on published nosocomial outbreaks worldwide which could be better utilised by infection control specialists.

The majority of articles included in this review identified that breaches in infection prevention control practises were a contributing if not the major factor in nosocomial hepatitis events. Despite an abundance of guidance published on mitigating the risk for nosocomial transmission deficiencies in following standard precautions exist across all settings types and countries. There is therefore a need to strengthen basic IPC procedures in all settings including in the community with emphasis on regular staff training and audit. The importance of protecting HCWs through hepatitis B vaccination and regular screening for bloodborne viruses has also been highlighted in this review through the reporting of several outbreaks involving infected staff. Finally there must be strengthened coordination between institutions and countries to share high-quality data and good practise in order to enable a coordinated response to the challenge of nosocomial hepatitis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcHJhZ2F0aXZhZGkuY29tL3VuaXZlcnNhbC1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLWFjY2Vzcy1pbi1vZGlzaGEtb3Bwb3J0dW5pdGllcy11bmZvbGRlZC1hdC1taW8tY29uY2xhdmUtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Universal Healthcare Access In Odisha—Opportunities Unfolded At MIO Conclave 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='pragativadi.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /universal-healthcare-access-in-odisha-opportunities-unfolded-at-mio-conclave-2022/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C491954490>, 'Connection to pragativadi.com timed out.

Lasso artista venezolano recibe certificaciones de oro y doble platino en el escenario,"Andrés Vicente Lazo conocido artísticamente como Lasso y autor de temas como Un Millón Como Tú y Odio Que No Te Odio recibió certificaciones de oro por su disco ‘Cuatro Estaciones’ y de doble platino más oro por su sencillo Ojos Marrones. El Director General de Universal Music México Alfredo Delgadillo junto a representantes del equipo de marketing de la empresa le entregaron a Lasso los reconocimientos después de uno de sus conciertos en el Lunario del Auditorio Nacional en la Ciudad de México el pasado 30 de noviembre.

Lasso de que recientemente se publicó el tema Yo No Nací Para Amar con Juan Gabriel (1950-2016) cuenta con más de 100 millones de reproducciones en su álbum ‘Cuatro Estaciones’ en la plataforma de streaming Spotify. Es un álbum conceptual que consiste de una serie de EPs que van detallando la progresión de la relación de una pareja: en primavera se conocen en verano se enamoran en otoño comienzan los problemas y en invierno terminan.

En 2021 además Lasso fue nominado a un Grammy Latino en la categoría de mejor nuevo artista que terminaría ganando la colombiana Juliana Velásquez. En esa ocasión estuvo nominado junto a artistas como María Becerra Bizarrap y Zoe Gotusso. Algunos de los ganadores históricos del Grammy Latino a mejor nuevo artista fueron Juanes la agrupación Calle 13 David Bisbal Karol G y Mike Bahía.

El cantautor venezolano ha visitado Ecuador un puñado de veces. Estuvo en el país por última vez el 12 de julio de este año cuando tocó en el Teatro Sánchez Aguilar en Guayaquil en el marco de su última gira el ‘Algodón World Tour’ y le reveló a este Diario el origen de la canción Ojos Marrones y que ya había encontrado a sus “ojos marrones”.

AT&T began the sunset of its 3G network in February followed by Sprint 3G (T-Mobile) on March 31 Sprint LTE (T-Mobile) on June 30 and T-Mobile 3G on July 1. Now Verizon is set to sunset its 3G network on Dec. 31.

Jennifer Coreno product manager for connected devices at Verizon Connect said they are on track to upgrade all impacted Verizon Connect vehicles in the U.S. by the end of the year and are not planning any extensions to the sunset deadline for fleet management customers.

With the deadline looming several telematics providers are working to assist trucking companies in last-minute rushes to make the switch to networks with higher capability including 4G and 5G.

“The ball really does drop on New Year’s Eve” said Tony Nicoletti vice president of business development at DPL Telematics. “Like anything everybody waits to study for the test the night before so people are scrambling last minute to update their devices. It's human nature I think to wait ‘til the last minute.”

Nicoletti said when there’s a sunset there’s a major disruption for everybody but it has been especially challenging this go ‘round because of supply chain disruptions preventing vendors from making upgrades due to lack of things like semiconductors. He said DPL has had several calls with customers recently who are behind on the transition but 90%-plus of its customers have converted to the new network.

For Deseret Transportation Fleet Manager Steven Roberts said the 3G sunset has been almost imperceptible so far.

“We did have to replace the telematics on some our refrigerated trailers. Of course our in-cab telematics have received software updates to be compatible with the 5G but we have not had to replace any units” he said. “We did have a group with telematics from a company that basically would not work with the 5G so we had to switch them to a different provider which required all new hardware.”

Nicoletti said Deseret’s latter situation in which it had to switch to a new provider is one some carriers will have to face if their vendors haven’t been able to upgrade their technology which he said requires a lot of physical labor and extra cost when having to replace hardware in multiple units. The switch he said is having an impact on carriers’ bottom lines if they haven’t built in that capital to make these technological advances. And if they’ve waited until the last minute to handle the transition he said their devices will officially go dark if they haven’t already Dec. 31 further impacting their pocketbooks as it could result in shutting down operations.

Knight-Swift Transportation (CCJ Top 250 No. 5) has stayed on top of the transition. For example the carrier began the process of replacing more than 20000 soon-to-be outdated trailer tracking units for dry van trailers in 2020. Management took the two years ahead of the 3G shutdown to evaluate test and install a 4G-enabled telematics platform ultimately choosing SkyBitz’s Falcon GXT5002C asset tracking solution with integrated cargo sensor and making the switch ahead of schedule despite COVID-19 restrictions and supply chain disruptions.

Siamak Azmoudeh vice president of product lifecycle management and business development at SkyBitz said all of the company’s customers which were primarily running on the AT&T network have made the jump to 4G with very few having a handful of trailers that continue to roam.

SkyBitz was able to negotiate with AT&T to extend its 3G services by allowing customers to roam on the T-Mobil network to give them six additional months for the transition.

“It’s not an easy thing to do especially depending on the size of fleet you have. It's not an easy transition whenever you have to go and replace units” Azmoudeh said. “But I think we've gotten over the hump and I think most customers are where they need to be.”

Thought fleets knew this shutdown was coming many have failed to prepare. He said this network shutdown has opened eyes to the importance of making the transition early but also has taught carriers to give more thought to what technologies they’re buying into.

“I think customers learned during that process and now when they're looking at investing in new technologies they're thinking ‘How long is this going to last for me? Is it something that is going to sunset quickly?’” he said. “I think it was a pretty good eye opener in a way and helps customers understand even more when they're thinking about investing in technology.”

He said the good news is with SkyBitz technology customers will be able to retain their devices for another 15 to 20 years even as additional network expansion comes forth.

Similar to 2G and 3G Nicoletti said the 4G network should be remain online for five to seven years before a full transition to the next spectrum is required. With 4G Nicoletti said networks have built a narrower bandwidth that requires less power and provides greater reach dedicated to telematics and other IoT services so they don’t have to compete with individuals streaming video on their iPhone for example.

Coreno said Verizon Connect customers are already seeing the benefits of that.

Texas-based equipment rental company KRP Rentals and Trucking said as a result of its new 4G LTE devices it is getting faster response times on pinging and getting more accurate data about where its assets are.

“It is important for any remaining 3G fleets to move fast as time is running out until vehicles stop reporting as a result of the 3G sunset” Coreno said.

She said carriers need to discuss with their current fleet management provider to verify which of their vehicles and devices need an upgrade from 3G and determine what the best approach to that switch is. During this process all vehicles should be evaluated – the year make and models associated with 3G devices on their fleet she said. From there 4G hardware recommendations can be made and with Verizon Connect customers can select the installation type that is most convenient for them including self-install options and hidden (behind the dashboard) installations.

“Who keeps a computer or phone for seven years because it becomes obsolete and slow? That being said if you find a vendor that has a product that will last seven years that’s a great vendor. I’d stick with that vendor no matter what” Nicoletti said. “But by the time that seven-year mark rolls around you'll probably be wanting to look to upgrade to whatever the latest and greatest is anyway.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3NoZS13YXNudC1zdXJlLWFib3V0LXRoZS1nYWxheHktei1mbGlwLTQtdmVyaXpvbi10b29rLWNhcmUtb2YtdGhhdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,She wasn't sure about the Galaxy Z Flip 4. Verizon took care of that,"That's the one. The purple one. Jason Hiner/ZDNET

When it comes to gadgets my wife doesn't often make quick decisions.

She researches. She asks questions. She goes to see the products.

Then she goes away and thinks about it.

Regular readers -- what is wrong with you? -- will know that my wife intended to upgrade from her Samsung Galaxy S20 to an S22. Because that's what a lot of people do when they're in the mood for a new phone.

Upgrade to the latest version of the same thing.

The story so far

But when she went to a Verizon store a while ago Samsung's folding phones had been placed next to the S22 range at the very back of the store. This rather flipped her mind.

ZDNET Recommends The best foldable phones Samsung leads the pack with a number of models and variations. Read now

She stared longingly at the Z Flip 3. She considered its beauty and its throwback qualities. She wondered whether the crease in the middle would become a distraction. She pondered whether to get a black one or in a fit of daring go for a color.

Also: Galaxy Z Flip 4 vs Galaxy Z Flip 3

And then she decided to leave the store. To think about it you understand.

That was back in April. Since then she didn't mention much about the Z Flip 3. Somehow never having seen anyone sporting one the subject had been forgotten.

A couple of weeks ago though she turned and said something extraordinary: ""There's a new one isn't there?""

I looked up from a random third division sporting event on my laptop and said: ""A new what? A new British Prime Minister?""

Review: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3: A stunning foldable

""No a new flip phone.""

She'd seen an ad. Perhaps Samsung had been following her around all this time knowing that she'd once hankered slightly for a folding phone.

She still wasn't quite sure about it but she went again to a Verizon store which welcomed her with open arms as long as she could wait an hour or make an appointment.

She chose the latter and I went along with her to observe whether she'd finally go over to the Flip side.

Oh it's you. We've been waiting for you



It was as if Verizon has seen her coming.

ZDNET Recommends The best Android phones Here are the top Android phones you can buy. Read now

Immediately we walked in there was a purple Z Flip 4 at the front of the store staring at her like a puppy in a rescue home. The Fold wasn't there. It was the Flip they were definitely selling.

My wife instantly saw it and instantly admired it. This was just too easy right? Verizon wasn't going to let this chance go.

Within seconds though she was whisked away to meet her Verizon salesperson.

She explained she was interested in the Z Flip 4 and he carefully walked her through the attributes. The convenient size the fact that the crease allegedly won't split apart or even be noticeable and inevitably the astoundingly convenient way it helps you take selfies.

I can't say my wife takes a lot of selfies. I can say though that she's moved when an invention has a clever aspect. Hey she's a scientist.

I asked the salesman whether many people were buying the Z Flip 4. He said yes and explained that it mainly appealed to women because of its size. Yet when you open it it's actually slightly longer than my wife's Galaxy S20.

Review: The Galaxy Z Flip 4 solves these two problems for me

""Why did my wife have to make an appointment?"" I wondered.

""You don't have to"" he said. ""But you could be waiting around for at least an hour before you can speak to someone.""

""An hour? Why?""

""We're so short-staffed. We're 70% down on our usual staff numbers. They're actually bringing in people from 100 miles away and putting them up in hotels to help us out.""

The salesman wasn't however in a rush. He let my wife play with the phone open it close it open it again scroll around on it. And yes wonder what it would be like taking a selfie.

The gentle closing



It was as if the salesman was ready with one enticing item ready to close the sale. He certainly was.

He looked at her account revealed that the phone would only cost her a couple of dollars a month and then calmly said: ""And then there's all the free stuff.""

""Free stuff?"" she wondered.

""Yes you can get the buds the watch and a tablet. All for free.""

Review: Samsung Galaxy Buds 2: Packed with features

I confess that even I was astounded by this. Verizon and Samsung were prepared to give away all this stuff just to make my wife happy?

Did they have this great a problem with hardware sales?

It was all over bar the handing over of a credit card.

My wife isn't greedy. She chose the Galaxy Buds as she has no real need of the other two offerings. Most excitingly she chose purple buds and yes finally a purple Z Flip 4.

The salesman carefully helped her port over her data. He showed her all the phone's innards and the clever buds case. To my life-addled eyes he did a perfect job of not merely selling but pacing the sale.

In the days since she bought her purple Z Flip 4 my wife has stared lovingly at it. She feels it's not quite a return of the past as the flipping mechanism is much less springy than on an old flip phone.

She marvels at the better battery life faster charging hasn't found the crease a problem at all and is entirely enamored with her Buds.

She feels like she has a phone that's patently different a homage to the past and a break from the past. And yes she's starting to take a lot more selfies. (Of us you understand.)

This truly is a very different -- and marvelous -- phone.

Wait wasn't Apple the one that always thought different? Oh well. Perhaps Samsung just hasn't always sold its points of difference so well.

But Verizon seems to be doing a decent job of it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXJrc2hpcmVlYWdsZS5jb20vbmV3cy9jZW50cmFsX2JlcmtzaGlyZXMvcGl0dHNmaWVsZC1jb3VuY2lsb3JzLXdhbnQtYW5zd2Vycy1vbi13aGV0aGVyLWEtY2VsbC10b3dlci1jb3VsZC1iZS1tYWtpbmctcGVvcGxlLWlsbC9hcnRpY2xlXzhjNzliNjNlLTcyOWUtMTFlZC1iMDFmLTVmZTRhMmM4NTc1NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pittsfield councilors want answers on whether a cell tower could be making people ill,"PITTSFIELD — After months of silence — and the launch of a lawsuit with several city defendants — the Pittsfield City Council is wading back into the longstanding dispute between Verizon Wireless and Shacktown residents who say a cell tower makes them sick.

This week the majority of city councilors voted to support petitions that ask either Mayor Linda Tyer or Council President Peter Marchetti to send letters to state and federal representatives asking them to advocate that the Federal Communications Commission reevaluate its radiofrequency exposure limits.

As of Friday those letters had not yet been sent.

How the FCC shields cellphone companies from safety concerns Like many people Bobbie Orsi had never paid close attention to questions about the health effects of cellphone technology. She mostly viewed it as an issue that had long ago been put to rest. But after becoming the chair of Pittsfield’s Board of Health as the complaints emerged Orsi a 66-year-old registered nurse who had spent much of her career in public health decided to educate herself. She combed through a stack of research studies. She watched webinars. She grilled a dozen scientists and doctors. Over several months Orsi went from curious to concerned to convinced first that radio-frequency emissions from Verizon’s 115-foot 4G tower were to blame for the problems in Pittsfield and second that growing evidence of harm from cellphones — everything from effects on fertility and fetal development to associations with cancer — has been downplayed in the United States.

The petitions come after ProPublica an investigative nonprofit newsroom published an extensive look at how radiofrequency limits established by the FCC in 1996 have long shielded wireless communications companies from health impact claims.

The investigation took a close look at how the city’s Board of Health attempted to take a stand against FCC. A cease-and-desist letter sent to Verizon Wireless in April claimed that while the FCC had the authority to rule on cell tower sites the board had the authority to rule on health claims regarding towers — even those that met FCC guidelines.

Much past council action on the cell tower issue has come at the request of residents or following conversations with them. Tower opponents said this week that petitions filed by councilors Ken Warren and Jim Conant were developed without talking with residents.

Letters drafted by Warren that will be sent to Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey and U.S. Rep. Richard Neal acknowledge the board has found legitimacy to the residents’ health claims.

“Our community has constituents who have become ill with symptoms that our Board of Health has determined to be likely caused by the cell tower radiofrequency radiation emissions” the letter states.

The letter and statements by Conant Tuesday night clarify that the council is looking for updated guidance on potential health and safety related to today's cell tower technology.

“We all know this has been a sinuous issue here for quite a while and we don't have any answers” Conant said. “We don't know what the health implications are.”

Conant said the intent of the letters is to show that “we're looking for information.”

“I’ll make this very clear: I do not support any litigation or lawsuit of any type” Conant said. “This is just an effort to communicate and get information from the state and federal level because our hands are tied by the FCC. They really run the show [and] we’d just like some information from them.”

Courtney Gilardi one of the residents involved in the ongoing lawsuit against the city said that while she feels “incredibly supported” by recent council actions she believes these letters will not get the cell tower removed from her neighborhood known by some as Shacktown.

Gilardi and Scott McCollough one of the attorneys representing residents say they turned to a lawsuit because other options came up short.

“If people don’t want litigation that’s fine” Gilardi said. “But get everybody into a room and work this out.”

The lawsuit

Meantime a case in Berkshire Superior Court filed by six residents of the tower area continues. The lawsuit names Mayor Tyer city Solicitor Stephen Pagnotta the Board of Health Verizon Wireless and a South Street property owner as defendants.

Over the last month lawyers from Donovan O’Connor and Dodig LLP representing the city defendants have used filings to push back against claims that actions by Pagnotta and Tyer “coerced” the board into dropping its cease-and-desist order against Verizon Wireless.

The plaintiffs submitted a motion in early November asking a judge to disqualify Donovan O’Conner and Dodig — of which Pagnotta is a partner — from representing the city in the lawsuit on the grounds the firm had conflicts of interest.

The plaintiffs argued that the firm’s conflicts came from previous work on suits involving local cell towers — including one involving the issue of abutter notifications for the same Pittsfield cell tower — and their role as “potential witnesses.”

The law firm has termed allegations of conflicts of interest “at best disingenuous misleading and irrelevant to the relief sought.”

“The Complaint and the Motion contain inflammatory rhetoric and appear to have been crafted largely if not solely for publicity rather than to set forth any reasonable or competent legal argument or cognizable claim at law” attorney Gregory Howard wrote in a filing.

Two weeks ago Superior Court Judge Michael Callan denied the residents’ request to bar the law firm from the case. He also turned away the firm’s request that residents be compelled to pay their fees.

On Nov. 25 the defendants asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit against them. Speaking Friday with The Eagle McCollough said he plans to submit the residents’ opposition to that request in the coming weeks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY29yYWxzcHJpbmdzdGFsay5jb20vc2l4LWJyb3dhcmQtc2Nob29scy1qb2luLXZlcml6b24tcHJvZ3JhbS00Mzc0N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coral Springs School Joins Verizon's Award-Winning Technology Program • Coral Springs Talk,"Share Tweet reddit Whatsapp

By Ryan Yousefi

Forest Glen Middle School was one of six schools joining a technology-driven initiative focused on providing equity within education for some of the most vulnerable populations across the country.

On December 5 Forest Glen Annabel C. Perry Pre K-8 Bair Middle School Driftwood Middle School Millennium 6-12 Collegiate Academy and Parkway Middle School announced the schools had joined the Verizon Innovative Learning program. This initiative seeks to train over 10 million youth in digital skills by 2030.

The Verizon program provides students with free technology devices internet access and innovative STEM learning programs to keep them connected and help facilitate learning wherever it takes place. The program also provides an on-call technology teacher to help school teachers best integrate their new digital resources.

“Technology continues to lead the way in our classrooms and in our communities” Broward County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Vickie L. Cartwright said in a press release announcing the six Broward school’s inclusion in the program.

“We appreciate the expanding partnership of Verizon Innovative Learning and Digital Promise that ensures our students have access to technology and resources that allow them to excel and compete in our highly technological society.”

With the addition of the Broward schools nationwide over 50 schools have now agreed to join the Verizon Innovative Learning program this school year. According to data provided by Verizon the program plans to provide nearly 30000 new students with technology resources and bring the program’s impact to 561 schools.

A total of 6521 tablets will be provided as part of the program. The market value of the Verizon Innovative Learning program’s investment in the 1:1 device initiative is on average more than $2.3 million per school.

To commemorate the occasion Forest Glen Middle School will host a kick-off event at the school located at 6501 Turtle Run Boulevard in Coral Springs on Monday December 5 at 5 p.m.

The event will feature STEM learning stations Sphero demonstrations MergeCube interactions and coding/STEM activities facilitated by student tech team members.

Forest Glen Middle School Principal Melissa Gurreonero said the program is worth celebrating not only because of the new devices at the school’s disposal but how the technology enables teachers to cater lesson plans geared towards the future.

“Verizon Innovative Learning is not just a program that offers tablets – the tablets are the ‘eye candy’ piece of this program” said Melissa Gurreonero via press release.

“Verizon Innovative Learning offers an approach to learning that is cutting edge and necessary for our students to thrive in this ever-changing world.”

Get a free iPad and Apple Watch with an iPhone 14 Pro at Verizon,"In case you missed it last week Verizon's amazing Black Friday deal on the iPhone 14 Pro is still available this weekend with the chance to bag not only a free pair of Beats but an iPad and an Apple Watch SE.

These freebies add up to over $1000 in value and even better still are available on top of the usual trade-in rebate or BOGO promotion at the carrier. In short you can potentially trade in an old device here pick up an iPhone 14 Pro on an unlimited data line with a discount of up to $1000 (essentially bagging a free phone) and then get your freebies on top.

As always with these Verizon deals the catch is that you need an unlimited data plan to be eligible for all these savings. Since these can cost up to $90 per month for the higher tiers over 36 months you're looking at spending a significant amount of cash without the associated trade-ins and freebies. Because of this lining up a decent deal (such as this Black Friday special) is crucial if you want to wring as much value as possible out of your carrier plan.

Note that this iPhone 14 Pro deal ends on Monday so there's not long left to bag it if you're interested. We've also rounded up a few more of the still-available Verizon Black Friday deals down below which are all expiring soon and offering some great alternatives should you want to skip the freebies - in particular the iPhone 14 Plus for $10/mo which is a fantastic option that doesn't need a trade to be a great value.

iPhone 14 Pro with free iPad and Apple Watch

Apple iPhone 14 Pro: up to $1000 off with trade plus free Apple Watch SE iPad and Beats Fit Pro

This is the highlight of this year's Verizon Black Friday deals. The excellent iPhone 14 Pro is up for grabs with the usual trade-in rebate of up to $1000 but with a free Apple Watch SE iPad 10.2 and pair of Beats Fit Pro being thrown in. That's just over $1000 in free gifts according to Verizon and an amazing little package to get on top of the usual saving. Also available today is the buy-one-get-one-free promo but that doesn't stack with the trade-in rebate.

The freebies with this particular iPhone 14 Pro Verizon deal are the standard 2021 iPad 10.2 the Apple Watch SE 2022 and the Beats Fit Pro. Collectively they aren't the highest-end models on the market right now but they are absolutely fantastic devices in their own right and a perfect pairing with the iPhone 14 Pro.

The number 12 is tightly linked with December. It's the 12th month of course. There are 12 days of Christmas according to the traditional carol. Allow me to add one more connection with 12 to the list. Here are 12 top stocks to buy in December (listed alphabetically by category).

Energizers

Let's start off with a group I called the ""energizers."" These are stocks of companies that are in the energy sector and have solid prospects going into the new year.

1. Brookfield Renewable

The shift to renewable energy is arguably one of the most unstoppable trends around. Countries and companies across the world are scrambling to reduce their carbon emissions. That points to a bright future for Brookfield Renewable (BEP 1.34%) (BEPC 2.08%). The company currently operates hydroelectric wind solar and distributed energy facilities with a combined capacity of 24 gigawatts. Brookfield Renewable's development pipeline capacity is more than 4 times greater.

2. Devon Energy

Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%) has been a big winner in 2022 soaring close to 60% year to date. The oil and gas producer should be able to perform well in 2023 as well with Devon likely to generate strong free cash flow. Even if the stock doesn't sizzle in the new year investors can enjoy Devon's juicy dividend yield of 8%.

3. Enterprise Products Partners

Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.59%) stands out as another high-yield dividend stock that's practically a no-brainer pick. The midstream energy company offers a dividend yield of nearly 7.8%. Enterprise has increased its dividend for 24 consecutive years. And its fortunes don't depend on fuel prices. The company charges fees for transporting fuels and chemicals through its pipelines that aren't based on commodity prices at all.

4. Occidental Petroleum

Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.04%) has been an especially big winner this year with its shares skyrocketing 140%. You can thank Warren Buffett for part of this impressive gain. Buffett has loaded up on Occidental stock for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. I think the Buffett effect will continue into 2023. Berkshire secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of Occidental but currently owns only 21.4%.

Healthy picks

Whether or not a recession is on the way remains to be seen. But several healthcare stocks should be able to deliver solid gains no matter what happens.

5. Axsome Therapeutics

Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM -1.60%) stock has nearly doubled this year. Wall Street thinks it can go a lot higher. I agree. Axsome now has a potentially huge winner with major depressive disorder drug Auvelity on the market. It also expects to file for U.S. regulatory approvals in 2023 for AXS-07 in treating migraines and AXS-14 in treating fibromyalgia.

6. Novocure

Novocure (NVCR 2.11%) is another healthcare stock that could soon skyrocket. The company plans to announce results from a late-stage study evaluating its tumor treating fields (TTFields) therapy in treating non-small cell lung cancer in early 2023. Novocure also has data from three other late-stage studies of TTFields on the way over the next couple of years.

7. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

I view Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.91%) as a virtually unstoppable growth stock to buy and hold. The company has a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. It should soon file for regulatory approvals of exa-cel in treating (to be more precise curing) rare blood disorders sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Vertex's pipeline is also loaded with potential blockbuster therapies.

Tech and fintech

Sure tech and fintech stocks have taken a beating in 2022. But the future should be brighter over the long run -- especially for these two stocks.

8. Alphabet

I think Alphabet (GOOG -0.75%) (GOOGL -0.77%) is the best FAANG stock to buy in December. The Google parent's moat remains strong. Its growth prospects look great particularly with Google Cloud. Alphabet could also have some game changers in its ""other bets"" portfolio.

9. Mercadolibre

MercadoLibre (MELI -0.08%) stands out as a company whose stock performance hasn't reflected its underlying business strength in 2022. The Latin American e-commerce and fintech leader delivered 61% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarter. Look for MercadoLibre to rebound strongly once macroeconomic worries subside.

The REIT stuff

Some of the stocks already mentioned could appeal to income investors (namely Devon and Enterprise Products Partners). However there are also a few real estate investment trusts (REITs) that offer fantastic dividends and have solid long-term growth potential.

10. Digital Realty Trust

Digital Realty Trust (DLR -1.45%) is a data center REIT with a dividend yield of nearly 4.5%. CEO Bill Stein noted in the company's third-quarter earnings call that there are ""powerful long-term secular demand trends broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT."" He's right -- and that translates to great opportunities for this REIT going forward.

11. Easterly Government Properties

If you're looking for a super-safe business Easterly Government Properties (DEA) could be just the ticket. The REIT leases properties to U.S. government agencies. The risk of missed rents (one of the biggest threats to REITs) is practically nonexistent for Easterly. Investors should also like Easterly's dividend yield of more than 6.7%.

12. Medical Properties Trust

Last but not least Medical Properties Trust (MPW 1.92%) is a healthcare REIT with a mouth-watering dividend yield of nearly 9.2%. The financial outlook for the hospital operators that lease MPT's properties should improve with higher reimbursements on the way. With its attractive dividend and valuation (shares trade at under seven times expected earnings) MPT looks like a great beaten-down stock to buy in December.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NodWIuY28ubnovaG9tZS9uZXctemVhbGFuZC8yMDIyLzEyL3BoYXJtYWMtc2lnbnMtZGVhbC10by1mdW5kLWxpZmUtc2F2aW5nLWN5c3RpYy1maWJyb3Npcy1kcnVnLXRyaWthZnRhLmh0bWzSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2h1Yi5jby5uei9ob21lL25ldy16ZWFsYW5kLzIwMjIvMTIvcGhhcm1hYy1zaWducy1kZWFsLXRvLWZ1bmQtbGlmZS1zYXZpbmctY3lzdGljLWZpYnJvc2lzLWRydWctdHJpa2FmdGEuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pharmac signs deal to fund life-saving cystic fibrosis drug Trikafta,"Today after hearing the news that Trikafta would be funded in New Zealand she was speechless.

""Oh my God. I don't know what to say. My heart is going so fast. What? How did this happen?"" she told Newshub.

While the drug is listed at $324000 per person per year Pharmac negotiated a significant but commercially sensitive discount.

Pharmac's director of operations Lisa Williams said although it will cost New Zealand ""many millions of dollars"" it is money worth spending.

""Our calculation was that people who used Trikafta would get 27 more years of good health using this product. That's amazing"" she said.

And the pills won't cost anything for users.

""They will be completely free"" Williams said.

There are 388 people who will be eligible for funded Trikafta.

Nineteen-year-old Powell now lives in Sydney since Australia already subsidises Trikafta. But the reality that her home country will now fund the drug sunk in as she called her sister to tell her the good news.

""From April next year Trikafta is funded for everyone over the age of six"" she tearfully told her sister.

""Does that mean you can come home?"" her sister asked and Powell confirmed ""it does"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9oYXdrZXMtYmF5LXRvZGF5L25ld3MvaGF3a2VzLWJheS1hZHZvY2F0ZXMtY2VsZWJyYXRlLWFmdGVyLXBoYXJtYWMtcHJvcG9zZXMtZnVuZGluZy1mb3ItY3lzdGljLWZpYnJvc2lzLWRydWcvTUNZWFRSSlZRRkNVTkxKWVQ2NFBRSUdBV1Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advocates celebrate after Pharmac proposes funding for cystic fibrosis drug,"Tania Camplin left and Claire Fisher advocates with relatives who have Cystic Fibrosis celebrating the announcement that Pharmac is going to be funding the live-changing treatment Trikafta.

Hastings man Joe Voyce has experienced firsthand how life-changing Trikafta is for people with Cystic Fibrosis and he is stoked to know many others will now enjoy the same improvements to their lives too.

Pharmac officially confirmed their proposal to fund elexacaftor with tezacaftor and ivacaftor also known as Trikafta on Sunday evening.

From 1 April 2023 people with Cystic Fibrosis will have funded access to Trikafta if they are aged six years or older have specific mutations and meet clinical criteria according to the announcement on Sunday evening.

Pharmac estimates that the treatment could give people with the condition up to 27 more years of full health compared to supportive care.

31-year-old Voyce has been receiving Trikafta through managed treatment on compassionate medical grounds with Vertex Pharmaceuticals for about three weeks before the Pharmac approval and he has already had significant improvements to his quality of life.

“It’s nice to know that there are a lot of kids that won’t have to go through a lot of the things that us older guys with CF have had to go through” Voyce said.

“Three weeks ago my real life started. Breathing isn’t a problem I don’t cough. I can think about other things instead of worrying about my health now I can just focus on not wasting the extra time I’ve got just using it and living my life” he said.

He has been able to return to completing household tasks without getting puffed and working out at the gym after work.

His sister Tania Camplin said Voyce had reached the point where if he had one more infection then he may not have been able to recover before the treatment.

“We couldn’t have ever expected that it would work in the way it has done.”

Claire Fisher secretary of the Hawkes Bay Branch of Cystic Fibrosis NZ said she had been fighting for funding since her 16-year-old daughter Amber was born with Cystic Fibrosis and she was “shocked” in a good way to hear the news.

“It has been a long battle to get Trikafta funded in New Zealand but until last night we thought it would take much longer.”

She said she was thinking of people whose loved ones are no longer around to benefit as well.

“Cystic Fibrosis families all over NZ are incredibly emotional today as we process the knowledge that our community has finally won.”

She said she was hopeful that the proposed funding would be a start to addressing the country’s lack of access to modern medicines.

“Pharmac’s criteria has to change they have to be able to take into consideration the wider benefits of funding modern medication” she said.

“My understanding is that funding Trikafta will ultimately save our country money and it will certainly benefit our mental health system as well as have the obvious benefits to the physical health of people with Cystic Fibrosis.”

Pharmac estimates more than 360 people in New Zealand would be eligible under the proposed criteria.

There are about 500 people with Cystic Fibrosis in New Zealand.

Consultation on the funding has opened and will close at 5 pm Monday 16 January 2023.

Over the next 14 years Visa Petrochemicals became a linchpin in an elaborate plan by American chemical giant UCC to discreetly sell its products in India while it evaded criminal trial for spewing lethal gases that killed the residents of Bhopal on the midnight of December 2 1984. A Bhopal court had declared UCC’s then-CEO Warren Anderson a fugitive and ordered that the properties and products of UCC and its subsidiaries all of which were proclaimed offenders and absconders in India for not appearing in the criminal trial against them be seized.

Internal company records accessed by The Reporters’ Collective (TRC) for Al Jazeera now reveal that UCC discreetly sold its products to several firms owned by the federal and state governments and some large private corporations. Among them was a buyer from ground zero: a firm owned by the government of Madhya Pradesh the state whose capital Bhopal saw one of the world’s worst industrial disasters. The firm was a joint venture partner in a cable company that bought UCC products.

To create a discreet backdoor into India where the public saw it as the devil of Bhopal and courts were going after it UCC and its associates floated three firms one each in India the United States and Singapore. In its internal records Carbide employees called them “front” and “dummy” companies. At times they referred to these companies as their “extended arms”. These firms took orders from Indian customers on UCC’s behalf relabelled its products routed them through multiple ports and supplied them to customers. The company sold materials that went into the making of household products ranging from telephone cables to paints.

UCC internally admitted that the dummy companies were “a legal requirement” to help it keep its “distance from India”. This admission was made in an internal business plan for UCC to keep selling its goods in India even after the Indian court had ordered the seizure of all its moveable and immovable assets in the country. The court did not explicitly declare the future sale of UCC products illegal. But it had ordered that all its assets be seized including products and goods meant for sale.

The government companies that traded with UCC knew about this backdoor arrangement as UCC privately informed them when its front company participated in tenders.

This backdoor arrangement continued until 2002 a year after American giant Dow Chemical bought all assets of Carbide for $9.3bn. The period saw Union governments led by both the main Indian parties Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Between 1995 and 2000 the company sold more than 55800 tonnes of wires and cables in the Indian market according to records. In 1999 alone the company sold products worth $24m through this arrangement.

While media in India had reported that Dow relabelled UCC’s products and sold them in the country through a front company for a year the group’s elaborate discreet channels – the network of front and dummy companies – and information on UCC customers including government corporations that knowingly bought products through this shadowy channel had been buried so far. Information on the people behind the dummy companies and their workings – active for almost 14 years – is being published for the first time.

The fountainhead of these revelatory records are documents submitted in a US court hearing when Dow UCC and its dummy companies got into litigation over the pricing of products in the early 2000s and submitted evidence of their relationships.

The collective sent detailed queries to UCC and Dow but did not receive a response.

Lethal business

It was the death of a technician from phosgene poisoning on a cold Christmas eve in 1981 that first foretold an impending catastrophe and revealed cracks in the UCC factory in Bhopal. UCC’s global profits had plummeted 90 percent in the three years preceding the disaster. Its India unit could sell less than half its production capacity of Sevin a “miracle insecticide” born on the banks of the Hudson and reborn in India on the sands of Narmada.

Layoffs took hold and cost-cutting affected safety and maintenance protocols in the Bhopal plant. On the night of the disaster the safety valves and alarm systems of the tank that stored the lethal chemicals including the lethal methyl isocyanate used in the production of Sevin did not work. Some were dysfunctional others were turned off since malfunctioning alarms would repeatedly go off in the leaky plant.

“I remember that night” said 60-year-old Leelabai who lives in Bhopal’s JP Nagar located near the disaster site. At a distance overlooking her one-room house is the metallic carcass of the factory.

“I remember it like yesterday. Our eyes burned and people began vomiting. There was a stampede” she said tearing up. A deadly fog had filled nearby slums. Death struck in seconds and no one was prepared.

Leelabai and her husband were the only survivors in the family. Her three children died over the years as their health debilitated. “Our lives are worse than death” she said.

“None of us knew they had chemicals this dangerous” Savitribai another resident of JP Nagar told TRC.

More than 2000 people died over the following days after breathing a cocktail of deadly fumes one being hydrocyanic acid a chemical that causes a series of reactions leading to loss of blood flow to the brain and resulting in immediate death.

As per estimates by survivors’ groups 13000 people died over the next few years from damaged lungs brains kidneys and nervous and immune systems. Hundreds were disabled for life. The poisonous chemicals polluted (PDF) Bhopal’s soil and water for decades causing a perpetual health tragedy for residents.

Three days after the disaster when Anderson – still one of the West’s most powerful industrial leaders – visited India he was placed under house arrest in UCC’s luxury guesthouse over charges including culpable homicide causing death by negligence. Three hours later Anderson whose factory poisoned a city was released on a bail of 25000 rupees (about $300 at the current exchange rate). Within 24 hours he was mysteriously flown out of Bhopal in state Chief Minister Arjun Singh’s jet and then to the US in the company’s plane. Anderson never returned. He never faced trial. And died peacefully in 2014 aged 92 on US soil where he rose from a salesman in UCC to its CEO.

UCC was still the US’s third-largest chemical manufacturer and 37th among the top 50 US companies in 1984. The Bhopal accident was bad for business. It was a public relations nightmare and would run up several millions in legal costs. UCC had to find a way to continue trade. Who would help the company move past this?

The spin-off

For up to two years after the disaster UCC did its business in India as usual despite protests and outrage from survivors and activists. In December 1987 India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed charges against Anderson UCC and its subsidiary that oversaw Asia operations Union Carbide Eastern which was incorporated in Delaware US. By then UCC had set in motion a series of events that would help retain its grip on the Indian market while keeping a safe distance from courts. The first among them was the birth of Visa Petrochemical Limited.

The company was a “spin off from UCIL [Union Carbide India Limited]” said Visa Petrochemical’s Annual Business Plans submitted to the UCC in 1994. Ravi Muthukrishnan the then India country manager of Dow Chemical noted in an email to his bosses in 2001 that Visa Petrochemical was formed by former UCC employees engaged in “international trade” after the “government advised them to exit totally out of India”. He also noted that Visa whose name was changed to MegaVisa Marketing and Solutions in 1999 was UCC’s “extended arm” into India.

UCC signed an agreement with Visa Petrochemical on 14 November 1987 15 days before the CBI filed charges against the former and designated the new company its “non-exclusive distributor in India”. The arrangement allowed UCC to route its products through Visa. Under the contract Visa’s “duty” was to “canvas and promote sales” of UCC products. It was to do all this while “representing” UCC. The latter’s business could now proceed without the taint of its past.

In the next few years UCC incorporated a new subsidiary – Carbide Asia Pacific – in Delaware which slowly took over the operations of Carbide Eastern an accused party in the Bhopal case. This ensured UCC’s Asia businesses including the agreement with Visa Petrochemicals in India were carried out by a firm not named in the case.

In 1989 UCC paid $470m as compensation for the disaster in response to the civil lawsuit which the survivors’ representatives said was a meagre $500 for each victim and one-sixth of the compensation initially claimed by the government. But the government accepted the proposal without consulting the victims.

In 1992 after all the foreign parties who were accused evaded Indian courts in the criminal lawsuit Bhopal’s chief judicial magistrate seized all of UCC’s moveable and immovable properties in India. It did so after noting: “The accused Union Carbide USA wants to evade the prosecution going on in this court by transferring its properties in India by any means.” The magistrate labelled Anderson UCC (parent company based in the US) and Union Carbide Eastern as “absconders”.

For UCC continuing trade now would be tougher and more complicated than before. UCC and its affiliates had to come up with a new plan.

New partners

In February 1994 a young businessman called Ajay Mittal from Mumbai met UCC officials in Danbury to discuss the shipment of its products. The officials found the meeting with Mittal “excellent” and “frank” as per a fax sent by UCC officials to Mittal a day after their meeting a copy of which was submitted in court documents.

Mittal an American business school graduate is an heir to the realty business family Mittal Group and currently owns and runs Arshiya Limited a logistics and supply chain firm. A 2001 Dow India internal report described his family as a “fairly established group” that owns more than 3000 buildings in Mumbai.

After the court declared UCC an “absconder” and seized its India assets Mittal’s businesses proved crucial in fulfilling Carbide’s “legal requirement to distance from India” reveal company documents.

Mittal owned a firm in Houston called Mega Global Services which was set up in March 1993 documents show. A month later Carbide Asia Pacific terminated its contract with Visa Petrochemicals and on the same day signed a new agreement with Mega Global.

Mega Global Services’ role according to the new contract was to first buy UCC products and resell them to “customers located in India”. UCC’s products would be relabelled as that of Mega Global Services in this process.

Mittal did not stop there. Two months after the meeting in Houston he bought an 89.5 percent stake in Visa Petrochemical. His group now owned both the intermediaries crucial to UCC’s backdoor channel. Mittal UCC and Visa Petrochemicals worked out Carbide products’ route into India which was laid out in an annual business plan of Visa Petrochemical.

Visa Petrochemical would scout for customers. It would pass on formal price queries from potential customers to both Mega Global Services and Union Carbide Asia Pacific. They in turn sent them to the parent UCC which would send the prices to Carbide Asia Pacific. The Asia-Pacific unit would further send that information to Visa Petrochemical which sent it to the customer.

If the buyer agreed it would place the order with Mega Global Services. UCC would sell the product to Mega Global Services. UCC would arrange a third-party transporter known as a “freight forwarder” to ship the goods to the customer according to the agreement. Visa Petrochemical would sign off on an indent – a document listing out the products imported – for the customer.

While the product originated from UCC warehouses the seller on documents given at the Indian port was Mega Global Services for which it earned a commission.

Mega Global Services was referred to as a “front party as a conduit” in internal correspondence. The majority of Mega Global Services’ business revolved around buying and then shipping UCC products as their own.

In 1998 it was replaced by a Singapore firm with a similar name – MegaVisa Solutions Pte Ltd. This too was owned by the Mittal Group.

A July 2001 email by a Dow India manager to his bosses in the US says “MegaVisa Singapore entity was set up to take care of the post-Bhopal situation and is essentially a shell company.”

MegaVisa Singapore bought UCC products in the US “took title to them there and then arranged to ship the products to our customers from there” Sanjiv Sanghvi director at the Singapore firm submitted in a testimony to the US court in 2002.

This Mittal-owned network of “extended arms” and “shells” would ensure UCC’s products continued to be sold in the Indian market from 1993 to 2002. And among its customers were firms owned by the Indian government – the very party that was suing it for causing death and injuries to its citizens.

Government clients

Among UCC’s customers were wholly government-owned firms such as Gas Authority of India Ltd Hindustan Photo Films Manufacturing Company Ltd and Hindustan Cables. Lubrizol India then an equal joint venture between federal government-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and American chemical company Lubrizol was also a customer.

Companies promoted by the governments of Gujarat (Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd) Tamil Nadu (Indian Additives Ltd) and Madhya Pradesh (Vindhya Telelinks Ltd) also bought UCC’s products through the channel. The list of customers also includes more than 150 private firms including Reliance Industries Sterlite Industries Finolex Cables Crompton Greaves Berger Paints and Castrol India.

Many of UCC’s buyers clearly knew who they were shaking hands with. Documents show UCC informed Oil and Natural Gas Company (ONGC) and IOC that the Houston-based Mega Global Services would bid on its behalf for a tender floated by the public sector companies.

“We hereby authorise Mega Global Services to quote against the above [ONGC’s] tender” reads a letter dated November 16 1994 by Carbide Asia Pacific to ONGC’s general manager. Visa Petrochemical’s 1994 Annual Business Plan notes that the company managed a “breakthrough on TEG with ONGC”. TEG or triethylene glycol is a plasticiser chemical for which ONGC invited sellers.

“If MM Global Services is successful in winning the tender” UCC’s December 1999 letter to IOC reads “Union Carbide Corporation will supply the quantity required and the product supplied will meet all the requirements of our specification.”

MegaVisa Singapore submitted a July 2001 sales invoice for an order for methyl isobutyl carbinol worth $77656 by Lubrizol India. Lubrizol India was jointly owned by IOC and Lubrizol.

Visa Petrochemicals which changed its name to MegaVisa Marketing and Solutions worked closely with India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT). “MegaVisa is working with DoT to improve OIT test in the specification” reads one of Visa’s emails to Dow. OIT or oxidative induction time refers to a test to figure out the thermal stability of a wire.

UCC’s Indian front in fact had some level of influence on the government. An internal communication from MegaVisa to Dow from 2001 for example states that “with a lot of groundwork” the company managed to convince the Indian telecom department (DoT) to float a tender for the purchase of a cable product. This is a product that UCC through MegaVisa was supplying to the Indian market. “We need technical support from Dow [the US-based chemical giant had at this point taken over Union Carbide] to push DoT and Utilities for upgradation of specifications” it says in the same note.

“Even in this time of extreme turmoil & hostile environment for our team we have continued to work with DoT” Mittal said in an email to a UCC official on May 5 2000. He also notes that MegaVisa’s work with DoT will help “drive out smaller players”. “As we go ahead we are confident of achieving better volumes and better netbacks for UCC” he wrote.

Correspondence from two private firms – Sterlite and Finolex – show they too knew they were buying UCC products. Both firms sent legal notices to UCC and its subsidiary in the US and Sterlite even filed a civil suit against the company after some orders they placed with UCC’s Houston-based front company Mega Global did not come through. The companies eventually settled the case out of court.

Mittal did not respond to queries from Al Jazeera. An Indian Oil Corporation spokesperson said the company “did not have any comments about the trailing communication”. All the other government and private firms that traded with Carbide’s front companies including the DoT did not respond to Al Jazeera’s queries.

Dow’s takeover

In February 2001 Dow bought UCC. Soon activists demanded that the company come clean on why its fully owned subsidiary never faced trial and pay additional compensation to victims. Dow refused to take ownership of UCC’s liabilities arguing that it never owned the Bhopal plant and that the latter is a separate legal entity.

However Dow also continued trading UCC’s products for a year using its intermediary companies. But it was keen to mask its link to UCC. An email by the company’s public affairs director in March 2001 reads “Reporters will be tempted to keep talking about Union Carbide. But we should discourage reporters from using the words Union Carbide unless it’s a reference to a historical activity.”

In January 2002 Dow (India) informed MegaVisa that it would no longer be the distributor of most UCC products. By this time feedback from at least one Indian customer Berger Paints on MegaVisa’s personnel was not positive – referring to them as “non-committal” documents show. Additionally Dow’s India officials internally recommended that “major customers should be handled directly by Dow”.

MegaVisa in turn held Dow responsible for its losses. A year later Houston- and Singapore-based MegaVisa firms filed a case against Dow and UCC on “antitrust” grounds in the US Connecticut District Court. The MegaVisa firms alleged Dow had gone back on its contractual obligations and hampered its profits.

Dow eventually settled with the Mittal-owned firms out of court including the businesses in Houston Singapore and India. The details of the settlement are not known. UCC’s Indian front MegaVisa filed for liquidation in 2010. Its finances reflect a company that was suffering losses.

The same year the then Congress-led federal government moved India’s top court to change its 1989 order setting the compensation for the disaster’s victims. In its petition it asked the Supreme Court to reconsider that amount and demand additional compensation jointly from UCC Dow and Union Carbide India Limited. At the time the victims’ representatives also demanded that the “corporate veil” of UCC its subsidiaries and Dow be lifted. The case pending for more than a decade was last heard in October 2022 in which the Supreme Court asked the government to include the victims’ demands in its representation.

Martez Abram was convicted Thursday on two counts of capital murder and one count of attempted murder. The charges stem from a July 2019 shooting that left two Walmart employees dead and a Southaven police officer injured.

Prosecutors asked the jury to sentence Abram to death a task that would require a unanimous vote in support. The defense requested the jury to issue a life sentence without the possibility of parole citing mitigating circumstances to Abram’s mental health at the time of the shooting. However the jury returned and unanimously sentenced Abram to death.

The jury deliberated for just over 50 minutes while deciding to convict Abram but the deliberations over what his sentence should be took place over the course of almost three hours. They unanimously sent him to death for the killing of 40-year-old Anthony Brown and 38-year-old Brandon Gales.

The jury also found Abram should serve a life sentence for the attempted murder conviction. A judge will formally sentence Abram on a future date.

""The question of guilt I don't think was ever an issue"" 17th Circuit Court District Attorney Robert R. Morris said after the jury returned its verdict. ""I do think that the heavier issue was whether or not to apply the death penalty. And so I'm actually I'm glad they took that long because I do feel like justice was done. It was the right result. And I think they gave due consideration to the evidence from both sides...I'm actually glad that [the jury] took that long because it shows me that they didn't rush to judgment.""

Abram who will join 36 others on Mississippi's death row was a Walmart employee himself working for the grocer for about 20 years according to a company spokesman.

During the trial prosecutors said Abram also set fire to the store during the incident. They also said that after he was arrested following being shot by an officer an AK47 rifle was found. Officials said police were at the Walmart within three minutes and Major Seth Kern of the Southaven Police Department said had Abram reached the rifle ""the AK47 would have cut us in half at that distance.""

Abram did not have a criminal history prior to the July 30 shooting a fact his attorney John Keith Perry Jr. cited as a reason for him to not be sentenced to death.

Abram's younger sister Monique Abram spoke at the sentencing hearing on behalf of her brother detailing him pulling away from family to the point where he did not stop to see her when she approached him at the Walmart one time.

""I saw [Martez Abram] walking down the aisle and I smiled but he walked by me like he didn't know me"" Monique Abram said. ""I did what I thought was best and left him alone. I feel like maybe I should've put forward more of an effort. I just knew he wouldn't talk to me. He pushed us away.""

Monique Abram also said her brother was very different from the one she knew growing up saying ""This was not the brother I was raised with. This was not the brother my parents raised.""

Family members of the victims also spoke during Friday afternoon’s proceedings talking about how they have been since the shooting that killed Brown and Gales.

“He couldn’t say anything bad about Brandon but he still chose to take his life” said Tracy Tucker Norman who testified on behalf of the Gales family. “I don’t understand his reasoning for doing what he did…but God requires us to forgive you for what you did but with prayer over time we were able to forgive you for what you’ve done. We ask this court to punish him to the fullest extent of the law.”

After the proceedings were over multiple family members met with Morris where he reflected on the unfortunate circumstances that brought them all together but let them know he wanted to remain in their lives long after the case has seen its last day in court.

""it's been unfortunate that we had to meet under the circumstances but I was very pleased to have provided them the service that they needed which was to prosecute the case to see to it that justice was done"" he said. ""I advised them that I'm not done being in their life and I hope they will remain in mine because we have become friends. So you know it's this is a bittersweet situation. None of those people in there want to cause harm but it had to happen.""

To celebrate Disney’s upcoming 100-year anniversary the short “Oswald the Lucky Rabbit” was produced by Disney Animation’s hand-drawn animation team. Veteran animator Eric Goldberg (“Pocahontas” “Fantasia/2000”) directed the short with Dorothy McKim providing producing duties.

“Oswald the Lucky Rabbit” brings back the style and charm of Oswald’s appearance from the late 1920s. Presented in black and white the short uses classic hand-drawn animation to bring back the look and feel of animation from the silent era.

According to a statement from Disney Goldberg said “Oswald is such a plucky scamp. We wanted to bring Oswald back and in the short he literally returns to his original home the movie screen. We wanted to have Oswald do all of the ‘squash-and-stretch’ ‘rubber hose’-animation style celebrating that first generation of Walt Disney’s artists.”

Producer McKim added “On the eve of Disney’s 100th anniversary it was such a joy to create the first new Oswald short from our studio since 1928. Our hand-drawn animation team – including our hand-drawn legends Mark Henn Randy Haycock and Eric Goldberg as well our wonderful team of 2D apprentices had a ball animating in the style of Oswald’s era.”

Before Mickey Mouse There Was Oswald

Considered Walt’s first breakout animated star the mischievous rabbit starred in 26 short films. Universal released Oswald to audiences in 1927 with the debut short “Trolley Troubles.” Charles Mintz and George Winkler produced the project with Walt Disney directing.

Walt and his animation team which included Disney Legend Ub Iwerks used sight gags and physical comedy to help tell the story. This included Oswald being able to disassemble and reshape his body parts at will. Oswald’s exaggerated reactions to the situations around him also amplified the humor.

Oswald became a hit with both the press and audiences.

Loss and Heartbreak

Due to the success of the cartoons Disney decided to request an increase of $250 per short from Universal. Before making the trip to New York Iwerks alerted him that Mintz was signing Disney’s animators to new contracts and removing him as their boss.

When Disney arrived in New York Mintz offered him $500 less per short plus 50 percent of any profits. He also learned that Universal controlled the copyright to Oswald and all profits from the character. Feeling betrayed Disney turned down the offer and as a result lost creative control over Oswald to Universal.

The Long Journey Back Home

In 2006 Disney CEO Bob Iger made a deal with NBC/Universal to obtain the rights to Oswald for the studio. The deal included permitting sportscaster Al Michaels to contract with NBC in exchange for the return of Oswald. Since then Oswald has appeared in video games and merchandise an animated short and in Disney theme parks globally.

In conjunction with the animated short Disney has also launched an Oswald the Lucky Rabbit Snapchat lens that allows users to channel Oswald using AR technology.

Here are the top contenders to succeed Bob Iger,"In this article DIS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

Bob Iger CEO The Walt Disney Company Scott Mlyn | CNBC

Disney reappointed Bob Iger as its chief executive recently abruptly replacing his hand-picked successor Bob Chapek and giving Iger an early goal — find a new replacement during the next two years. Iger's attention has quickly turned to the other part of his mandate from the board — the immediate challenges facing Disney's business such as the company's reorganization cost structure and the future growth of its streaming business. But that hasn't quelled speculation about who his successor could be. Media industry executives and company observers are putting together a roster of potential candidates Iger and the board will likely consider in deciding whom to groom for the role next. The pool of possibilities include former Disney executives who were previously considered the future of the Mouse House before being passed over for Chapek a few internal rising stars and some sleeper picks who are either close to the creative community or already have ties to the company. Another possibility some consider is that Iger whose return was applauded by Wall Street and employees sticks around longer than his two-year contract. Here's a look at some of the people who could be next in line to lead Disney.

Calling up from the bench

Before calling Iger Disney's board considered a few internal candidates to replace Chapek but ultimately decided they were too new to take on the various pressures on the company CNBC previously reported. One of the candidates considered was Dana Walden said people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic. She is the head of general entertainment content and in charge of creating original entertainment and news programming for Disney's streaming platforms broadcast and cable networks. Walden's been known to have a hands-on role with content creators. In Iger's first memo to employees following his reinstatement he mentioned Walden as among the top lieutenants who would work with him on Disney's new structure which would put ""more decision-making back in the hands of our creative teams and rationalizes costs."" ""Disney will likely choose a successor that leads with talent relationship capabilities"" said Eric Schiffer CEO and chairman of Patriarch Organization and Reputation Management Consultants. ""The downfall of Chapek is he maimed Hollywood relationships."" One of the notable missteps made by Chapek during his quick turn as CEO was his handling of Scarlett Johansson's pay dispute. Walden took on her role in June after her boss Peter Rice was ousted after clashing with Chapek. Like Rice Walden came to Disney in 2019 as part of the company's acquisition of 21st Century Fox's assets. When she was promoted Chapek had called Walden ""a dynamic collaborative leader and cultural force who in just three years has transformed our television business into a content powerhouse."" At the time Disney's board had put its support behind Chapek. Still Walden lacks experience on business decisions and has focused her time on the creative side. Meanwhile Rice may be interested in returning to the company in some capacity and has remained in contact with Iger people close to the matter said.

Alan Bergman who's been with Disney for more than 25 years is another potential candidate the people have said. He is the chairman of Disney's studio content and spearheaded the integration of Iger's acquisitions into Disney's overall content pipeline. He also was mentioned in Iger's first memo. In addition Bergman has rapport with many creatives in Hollywood. Disney relies on those relationships and he might have a softer hand in dealing with talent and agents than what was seen with the Chapek and Johansson dispute. Unlike other top executives at Disney however Bergman doesn't have experience in many other divisions and has focused much of his career on studio content. Another Disney insider floated as a possible candidate has been Josh D'Amaro people familiar with the company have said. D'Amaro is head of Disney's parks experiences and products the same position Chapek held before becoming CEO. His long track record at the company — he began his career at Disney in 1998 and his positions have mostly centered around resorts — could bode well for him. As does his charisma. D'Amaro is generally well-liked by his peers and the cast members at the parks and considered a strong leader. While there have been complaints by guests at Disney's domestic parks that prices are steep and the ticket-reservation system is flawed few have blamed D'Amaro. Instead Chapek has taken the brunt of criticism with guests and analysts assuming the former CEO was responsible for setting strict guidelines for driving more revenue at the parks and resorts. Still D'Amaro doesn't have the creative experience that Iger is often lauded for. His resume is concentrated on the resorts and parks businesses. Rebecca Campbell who's currently in charge of Disney's international content and operations is another candidate that Iger may favor people familiar with the matter said. The executive who has worked in various divisions of the company after starting on the local TV side in 1997 is also well-liked. However while she also has experience running the streaming business in Disney+'s earlier days she was removed from the position and may not have the hands-on business experience to make the tough decisions facing the company's media business. If Campbell or Walden were to ascend to the CEO position it would be the first time Disney had a woman in the top job. A dark horse candidate from within the organization would be Sean Bailey the president of Disney Studios one observer said. Bailey who's maintained a relationship with Iger is well-liked by the creative community.

Outside possibilities

But Mayer seen here on Sept. 29 2022 and colleagues were stunned when Iger announced Bob Chapek would replace Iger immediately.

Opting to return Oswald to his natural habitat the minute-long short is presented in black and white dialogue-less and accompanied by a piano score reminiscent of the silent film era. It also features some impressive slapstick visuals that prove some gags are timeless.

Oswald the Lucky Rabbit was directed by legendary animator Eric Goldberg (Genie in Aladdin Phil in Hercules) and produced by Dorothy McKim (Prep & Landing Get A Horse! Meet The Robinsons).

“On the eve of Disney’s 100th anniversary it was such a joy to create the first new Oswald short from our studio since 1928” says McKim. “Our hand-drawn animation team – including our hand-drawn legends Mark Henn Randy Haycock and Eric Goldberg as well our wonderful team of 2d apprentices – had a ball animating in the style of Oswald’s era.”

“Oswald is such a plucky scamp. We wanted to bring Oswald back and in the short he literally returns to his original home the movie screen” says Goldberg. “We wanted to have Oswald do all of the ‘squash-and-stretch’ ‘rubber hose’-animation style celebrating that first generation of Walt Disney’s artists.”

Oswald is widely considered Disney’s first animated star. His debut came in the 1927 short Trolley Troubles and more than two dozen shorts were produced by Walt Disney and his team over a two-year period.

Spits In the Face of Fans Does Not Care About Actor's Illegal Activities,"Warner Bros. Discovery and subsidiary DC Studios the creator of the DC Universe is doubling down on its future release of The Flash (2023) despite the ongoing and unfolding Ezra Miller controversy.

Unlike its more streamlined cousin Kevin Feige’s Marvel Cinematic Universe the DC Universe — formerly the DC Extended Universe — has been haphazard at best. In an attempt to mimic the MCU’s Avengers team-up and explore the crossover potential of the franchise DC Studios prematurely released Justice League (2017) while having only so far debuted Henry Cavill’s Superman Ben Affleck’s Batman and Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman. Zack Snyder’s version of the movie would be released in 2021 to a better reception.

Along with the aforementioned Jason Momoa Ray Fisher and Ezra Miller joined the cast of Justice League rounding out the superhero squad as Aquaman Cyborg and the Flash respectively. Momoa’s solo outing Aquaman (2018) became and remains DC’s highest-grossing superhero movie with the film taking over $1 billion at the global box office. A sequel Aquaman the Lost Kingdom (2023) from director James Wan will release next year.

The newly reformed DC Studios under the leadership of Peter Safran and James Gunn looks to reenergize the labored DCU with a cohesive effort across film TV video games and animation and in 2023 the studio will release at least four feature films — Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023) Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom Blue Beetle (2023) and The Flash (2023). Other projects like Batgirl were famously canceled by Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav earlier this year.

What stands out in next year’s line-up is The Flash. Ezra Miller’s solo movie has reportedly received favorable test screenings and the studio will go ahead with its release. This is a controversial move considering the ongoing erratic behavior and illegal activities Miller has found themselves in.

After a slew of erratic behavior in Hawaii saw Ezra Miller involved in a karaoke bar bust-up in addition to an arrest for second-degree assault for throwing a chair at a woman a mother put out a temporary harassment behavior order against Miller for their alleged menacing and inappropriate behavior towards the child.

In another incident the Barry Allen star was also issued a North Dakota tribal summons but the courts could not locate the actor to serve the notice. This came in the wake of the parents of 18-year-old Tokata Iron Eyes filing paperwork asking a judge to issue an order of protection against the actor; they alleged Miller has groomed and brainwashed Iron Eyes encouraging erratic behavior and introducing them to drugs and alcohol.

Now in spite of all this Warner Bros. continues to move forward with The Flash. There was a meeting between Miller and Warner Bros. execs this past summer where the actor reportedly apologized for their actions and vowed to seek out care but the severity of Miller’s activities — which also includes alleged erratic on-set behavior — seems to have been brushed under the carpet.

The Twitter account for The Flash recently received an update by the way of a new logo. It is not unheard of for movie studios to refresh their content the closer a project gets to release. But Warner Bros.’s update to mark the impending release of The Flash goes no way to repair the damage Miller caused them and their audiences leaving the DCU once more open to debate discussion and controversy (see: Amber Heard).

Over the summer it was suggested that the studio had three options — Miller would seek out help do an interview explaining their actions and then do limited press for the DC Comics film; Miller would not do any press and the role would be recast in future installments; or Warner Bros. would scrap the $200 million project altogether.

On the upcoming film Comic Book Movie noted:

Though no official synopsis has been released The Flash is expected to be (loosely) based on the Flashpoint comic book arc and is rumored to serve as a “rest” of sorts for the DCU. Both Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton will return as their respective takes on Batman and the movie will also introduce Sasha Calle as Supergirl.

Judging by this latest update Warner Bros. is likely readying a trailer and the beginning of its press for The Flash. It will be interesting to see in what capacity the DC Studios movie is received by fans when it does. The Flash movie opens in movie theaters on June 23 2023 and stars Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman Ron Livingston as Harry Allen Kiersey Clemons as Iris West Michael Shannon as General Zod Sasha Calle as Supergirl Antje Traue as Faora-Ul and Maribel Verdú as Nora Allen. It is directed by Andy Muschietti.

Cartoon Network ordered a fifth full season in January but the order was cut in half during Warner Bros. Discovery's animation purge in October. On Dec. 2 co-creator Ben Levin confirmed that the team wrote the final episode of the series.

In January Cartoon Network and HBO Max ordered Season 5 with plans to debut the new episodes in early 2023. Cartoon Network also ordered the spin-off series Jessica's Big Little World which would feature Craig's little sister and an origin movie Craig of the Creek: The Movie. The optimism for the franchise's future took a hit on Oct. 7 when co-creator Matt Burnett confirmed that episode orders for Craig of the Creek Season 5 and Jessica's Big Little World Season 1 were cut in half. The news came amid massive cutbacks at Warner Bros. Discovery on animation projects.

""Both Craig of the Creek and [its] spinoff Jessica's Big Little World had their episode orders cut in half today. Just want to thank the crews of both shows for their incredible contributions – amazing talent that I encourage you to hire as they roll off"" Burnett wrote on Oct. 7. ""Still work to be done and shared with y'all though so stay tuned – both shows and the Craig movie are on another level.""

Levin shared an update on the situation on Dec. 2 confirming Craig will end its run with 181 episodes. His team wrote seven more episodes but those will not be produced because the episode order was cut. He promised to share more details about the unproduced episodes in the future.

""I'm going to miss this very much. The Creek was a giant sandbox and we tried to make room for everyone to play"" Levin wrote. ""We collectively channeled our childhood dreams and adventures into each episode hoping to inspire the kids watching at home or at least make them laugh. The infinite talents of the entire crew & cast made the Creek into a living breathing world. The characters and spaces were rich and nuanced and it felt like we could have explored them forever. And we certainly had more stories to tell but unfortunately because of this merger this is the end.""

Levin later thanked fans for watching the show and writers for working on the series for the past six years. ""Still 5 Seasons and a Movie (and a spin-off) ain't nothing"" he wrote.

Craig of the Creek debuted on Cartoon Network in February 2018. The series focuses on Craig Williams (Philip Solomon) a 10-year-old who lives in a fictional suburb of Baltimore with his two friends Kelsey (Noel Wells) and JP (H. Michael Croner). They go on adventures in their favorite creek a kid utopia of unexplored wilderness with children who rule over tree forts and bike ramps.

Craig has been acclaimed for its diverse characters and cast with two lesbian characters since the beginning and adding a non-binary character in 2019. The show's roster of characters has grown to include other LGBTQ characters. Craig earned two Daytime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Children's Animated Series and a GLAAD Media Award nomination for Outstanding Kids & Family Programming. Craig is available on HBO Max Hulu and the Cartoon Network website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbmV3cy90aGUtYmF0bWFuLWZhbi1hcnQtaW1hZ2luZXMtdmlnZ28tbW9ydGVuc2VuLWFzLWJsYWNrLW1hc2stZm9yLXNlcXVlbC_SAWtodHRwczovL2NvbWljYm9vay5jb20vbW92aWVzL2FtcC9uZXdzL3RoZS1iYXRtYW4tZmFuLWFydC1pbWFnaW5lcy12aWdnby1tb3J0ZW5zZW4tYXMtYmxhY2stbWFzay1mb3Itc2VxdWVsLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Batman Fan Art Imagines Viggo Mortensen as Black Mask for Sequel,"Warner Bros. Discovery had a great month in November after they revealed that Henry Cavill was returning as Superman and that there have been writers pitching a Man of Steel sequel. We also found out that James Gunn and Peter Safran would become the new co-CEO's of the newly minted DC Studios and they're currently hard at work developing a ten year plan. While the new co-CEO's focus might be the main DC Universe Matt Reeves is still hard at work expanding the universe that he started with The Batman. There's currently a series focusing on Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin and there's also a series focusing on the GCPD as well as one set in Arkham Asylum in the works for HBO Max. The studio recently signed Reeves to an overall deal so it seems that we'll be seeing more of that universe. The Batman sequel is currently being written and fans have been pitching who they think should be the villain. One fan seems to think that Viggo Mortensen should have a shot at playing Black Mask in The Batman 2.

An artist on Instagram that goes by the handle of @Clements.Ink created a design that imagines Mortensen as Black Mask for The Batman 2. In the fan art the actor gets Black Mask's classic look equipped with a burgundy suit. Ewan McGregor recently played the character in the Margot Robbie-led Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn). While there's no word on who will be the villain of the sequel this idea is enough to get Batman fans excited. You can check out the fan art below!

Gunn and Safran began their jobs as Co-CEO's of DC Studios at the beginning of November and it's safe to say that the future of DC is looking bright. When the duo was announced by the new Warner Bros. Discovery boss they released a statement on their excitement for the job.

""We're honored to be the stewards of these DC characters we've loved since we were children"" Gunn and Safran added in a joint statement. ""We look forward to collaborating with the most talented writers directors and actors in the world to create an integrated multilayered universe that still allows for the individual expression of the artists involved. Our commitment to Superman Batman Wonder Woman Aquaman Harley Quinn and the rest of the DC stable of characters is only equaled by our commitment to the wonder of human possibility these characters represent. We're excited to invigorate the theatrical experience around the world as we tell some of the biggest most beautiful and grandest stories ever told.""

The most recently released DC Film to hit theaters was the Dwayne Johnson-led Black Adam. Black Adam will star Johnson and will also feature Aldis Hodge (Underground The Invisible Man) as Hawkman Noah Centineo (To All the Boys I Love Before Charlie's Angels) as Atom Smasher Quintessa Swindell (Trinkets Euphoria) as Cyclone Sarah Shahi (The L Word Sex/Life) as Adrianna Tomaz and Pierce Brosnan (GoldenEye Mamma Mia!) as Doctor Fate. Uli Latukefu Marwan Kenzari Mohammed Amer James Cusati-Moyer and Bodhi Sabongui have also been cast.

To jump-start those efforts energy resource conglomerate WM (formerly Waste Management) donated $50000 in support of aligning the September 11th National Memorial Trail in Plainfield in New Jersey as part of an ongoing effort to connect communities to the trail.

WM presented the check and pledged a formal commitment during ceremonies at Washington Crossing Historic State Park in Upper Makefield. The trail runs through Washington Crossing and the park.

In Bucks County the trail largely runs along the Delaware River from Morrisville to Carversville. Part of the trail also takes visitors to the Garden of Reflection in Lower Makefield the official Pennsylvania memorial to the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks.

From Carversville the trail crosses through various Bucks County communities before crossing into Montgomery County.

Back in New Jersey a portion of the trail currently reaches Plainfield via Route 512. There the trail splits and becomes multi-use. WM's Grand Central Landfill is also located in Plainfield.

The September 11th National Memorial Trail Alliance also established an interactive map and tool of the entire trail.

WM has a long history and sprawling footprint here in Bucks County where it operates several landfills and recycling facilities.

""As a major employer landowner and member of many communities across the Greater Mid-Atlantic region WM continues to work for a more sustainable tomorrow"" said WM spokesperson Adrienne Fors. ""We are committed to making positive social impacts through environmental education and conservation.

""This allows us to dedicate resources to fund programs that make a difference in people’s lives.""

Trail origins:Bucks Montgomery counties part of planned 1300-mile 9/11 memorial trail

The nonprofit September 11th National Memorial Trail established the route in 2002; however roughly 50% of the trail is off-road. Trail organizers have been working with state and federal officials on more than a dozen projects designed to connect more than 30 trails.

In 2017 Bucks County Commissioners commissioners approved a resolution in support of the September 11th National Memorial Trail. The planned 1300-mile circuit will loop through Shanksville Pennsylvania New York City and Washington D.C.

On October 13 President Joe Biden signed H.R. 2278 bipartisan legislation to designate the 9/11 National Memorial Trail.

""20 years ago I envisioned a federally designated 9/11 Trail that would commemorate that tragic day for future generations"" said September 11th National Memorial Trail Alliance founder David G. Brickley said at the time. ""Now that opportunity is here and we are truly appreciative and excited to see this legislative process unfold within the 20-year anniversary of 9/11.""

​The nation's three September 11th memorial sites serve to honor the lives lost that day while educating current and future generations about the events of the day and the nation's response to them. The memorials form the three points of our roughly triangle-shaped trail.

""Working together the vision for the future aligns in supporting the development of a trail in several communities throughout the Pennsylvania Delaware New Jersey Maryland New York Virginia and Washington DC areas"" said September 11th National Memorial Trail chairperson Andy Hamilton. ""The September 11th National Memorial Trail is honored for this partnership.

However in November 2022 officially surpassed 2021 and 2018 as the worst year for waste and recycling facility fires in the U.S. and Canada with 268 fire incidents and we still have the entire month of December to go.

November 2022 Fire Data

This year has been the worst year for fires since I began reporting waste and recycling facility fire incidents in 2016. In November we experienced 18 publicly reported fire incidents in the U.S. and Canada. Twelve of these fire incidents occurred at waste paper and plastic facilities; three occurred at scrap metal facilities; and one occurred at each a construction and demolition (C&D) facility a hazmat operation and an organics facility. Although the numbers were down for reported fires across the industry at Fire Rover we responded to more than 100 fire incidents at our clients’ facilities.

It's Official

I want to make it 100% clear that the data I have been consolidating and analyzing since 2016 only includes the fire incidents that were “reported” by a media outlet or a government agency. In November 2022 officially surpassed 2021 and 2018 as the worst year for waste and recycling facility fires in the U.S. and Canada since I began reporting the data in 2016.

I developed the graph above to show actual number data while also including 2022 actual data plus December’s historical average. As you can see even with an average December from a historical perspective 2022 will be one for the books. If I had to put money on it we would come in above the average number and get close to the 400 annual fire incidents in 2022 we were on trend for until we came in far short this month.

Safety Knows No Competition

As one can imagine at Fire Rover we have a front-row seat to many different fire events some caused by batteries fireworks accelerants and the like in various waste and recycling occupancies such as municipal solid waste paper plastic metals scrap e-scrap hazmat C&D and organics. Some of our clients allow the videos to be shared and some do not. I do not judge as there are many perceived consequences that businesses deal with from a legal perspective public perception perspective and industry perspective when they share their events but it is always nice when we can share the videos. These videos allow us to learn from each other as we dissect each incident as well as educate the public on the dangers/hazards that improper recycling can cause.

With that being said I am a firm believer in the philosophy of “safety knows no competition” as I believe we can all learn from the fire hazards and incidents that are inundating our waste and recycling streams. Before we had a full understanding of the lithium-ion battery issue that has flooded our waste and recycling streams there was a belief that “good operators” did not have fires. I hope that it is clear to all that although there is no substitute for solid operational procedures and execution the fire hazards the industry faces are no fault of its own.

A global leader in waste and recycling SUEZ along with the Aberdeen Scotland City Council released a very informative video that walks viewers through a fire incident that ultimately led to a catastrophic loss for the Athens East Mixed Recycling Facility. This incident on July 6 started as many of the fires we see started on the tip floor. The cause of the fire is anyone’s best guess but based on my experience and most of the surveys I have seen there is a greater than 50% chance that a lithium-ion battery started the initial fire.

As we walk through the video there are several things to focus on:

4:04 p.m. – First sign of smoke was visible 4:35 p.m. – Automatic fire alarms are triggered 4:39 p.m. – Fire professionals are dispatched 4:44 p.m. – Fire professionals arrive onsite 4:47 p.m. – Automatic fire sprinkler triggered 4:48 p.m. – Fire professionals get site access Cameras melt

As you can see it took almost 30 minutes from the first sign of smoke—a symptom of an impending fire—for fire alarms to be triggered. There is a ton of opportunity during that time for solutions like the Fire Rover to pick up a thermal smoke or flash signature or a combination of these that would trigger our agents to dispatch the fire professionals and/or suppress the actual event. Not only did it take 30 minutes from the first sign of smoke for the fire alarms to be triggered but it took an additional 12 minutes for the sprinkler to go off. By that time the sprinkler is only there to buy time for the fire professionals to get water on the fire. In this case the fire professionals got to the site rather quickly; however getting access to the site was another step that took some time away from their fight.

The fact is that most jurisdictions across the globe only require these facilities to be covered by standard sprinkler systems. Sprinkler systems are an amazing invention that have saved countless lives in commercial and residential facilities and there are times when these systems work to put out fires in waste and recycling facilities. However the issue is that they are not made for the initial or final extinguishment of a fire. Most of the time they only hold the fires at bay until the fire professionals arrive on the scene to put the fire out.

The issue is all about time and response. If you are waiting for a sprinkler system to go off before the fire professionals are notified and dispatched you are already behind the eight ball.

Take a look at this video from one of our clients’ incidents:

This is a thermal-only system. We were notified by the direct heat and smoke 10 to 15 minutes before a fire sprinkler system would have been activated. We dispatched the fire professionals within less than a minute of our agent verifying that a fire was happening. Had we had our full Fire Rover solution in place we would have sprayed the scene within the same minute we dispatched the fire professionals having the fire under control by the time the fire professionals arrived on the scene.

The fire professionals took more than 10 minutes to arrive on the scene and almost 15 minutes to get any water on the hazard. In this case there was not a catastrophic loss to the building but most fire professionals would agree that another 5 minutes would have been the difference between a total loss and our customers going back to work the next day.

Now watch the video above. We identify and suppress the fire well before any sprinklers fire professionals or employees have to get involved. A night and day experience with little to no cleanup or downtime. Are they all this clean? Not a chance. What we do is hard but so is fighting fires. These incidents are dangerous stressful and unpredictable. There is no magic solution but there are solutions out there.

A recent article was shared regarding a grant provided to help optical sorters pull batteries out of the waste and recycling stream during sorting. Until some of these technologies are a reality we need to keep up the good fight of innovating educating the public training the firefighters and equipping them with the proper training to deal with these hazards. And the manufacturers of these hazards should be helping the industry foot the bill!

After being implemented this May the island of around 750 inhabitants quickly saw progress after they transformed the landfill into a recycling center and removed the large public common bins for trash.

Set up by Polygreen the Just Go Zero initiative is hoping to steer other Greek islands towards similar programs.

All biodegradable waste is turned into soil treatments while plastic metal glass and paper are all recycled.

For non-recyclable goods there is an upcycle center for still-working as well as for electronics and clothes either for re-use by someone else or for artistic creations.

“A new culture starts today in Tilos” said Polygreen founder Athanasios Polychronopoulos “a culture characterized by 100% landfill diversion full circular waste management and most importantly a completely new perception of life. We are envisioning a future where waste will only be seen in museums.”

Each resident is given a series of bags in which to separate the material and like most world-waste collection a truck arrives infront of your house on certain days to retrieve it and take it to he processing center. The Just Go Zero app allows residents to track how much material they’ve recycled and learn more about what products and projects it’s going towards.

Polities have all sorts of reasons for wanting a more recycling-based waste system and as well as providing jobs and keeping the beaches clean if you live on a beautiful island that’s only 24 square miles dedicating any of it to a landfill seems a shame."

But the country's best feature — at least when it comes to nature — is most certainly its beaches.

The Mediterranean destination has hundreds of beaches to explore from sunny mainland spots along the Athens Riviera to hidden getaways sprinkled across its many islands. You can’t go wrong setting foot on any stretch of shoreline here but there are a few that shine a bit brighter than the rest. Here are 20 of the best beaches in Greece that are worth exploring next.

Navagio Beach Zakynthos

The Greek island of Zakynthos is known for having a quieter atmosphere and that’s perfect for appreciating stunning places like Navagio Beach. Navagio Beach (also known as Shipwreck Beach) is a breathtaking little cove filled with white sand and surrounded by limestone cliffs. And as its nickname implies it comes with the skeletal remains of an old shipwreck still splayed across the shore.

Sarakiniko Beach Milos

Milos is another Greek island that’s far from the party atmosphere found in other well-known destinations nearby making it the perfect place to lay out on a beautiful beach for a blissful nap. Sarakiniko Beach is ideal for doing just that — though “beach” may be a misnomer as you won’t find soft sand here. Instead you’ll see a martian-like landscape made of white volcanic rock that falls into the azure sea.

Elafonissi Beach Crete

Looking for a splash of color? Head to Elafonissi Beach on the island of Crete. Here you’ll find soft pastel-pink sand lapping gin-clear waters creating a picture-perfect scene. The area is part of a protected nature reserve meaning there are very few amenities to be had but you’re really here for the stunning scenery. Just make sure to leave it as beautiful as you found it.

Voidokilia Beach Messinia

Those staying on the mainland have plenty of beach options too but none may be as special as Voidokilia. Located about 2.5 hours outside of Athens this beach is famed for its shape which resembles a massive Greek omega symbol. Visitors are encouraged to enjoy a dip and take a hike around the surrounding landscape for a higher view of the beautiful region.

Golden Beach Paros

It’s easy to find your own little patch of paradise at Golden Beach on the island of Paros. The glittering gold sand stretches for about half a mile so all you need to do is walk until you find your perfect spot. This beach also happens to be famous among windsurfers thanks to its breezes. You can even catch the Professional Windsurfing World Cup here every August.

Voutoumi Beach Antipaxos

Visitors to Voutoumi Beach on the island of Antipaxos will find emerald-green vegetation butting up against the electric blue waters — a scene so vibrant it almost looks surreal. There are also two small taverns on the beach making it a great spot to go from day to night.

Seychelles Beach Ikaria

Those looking for a little more privacy can make their way to Seychelles Beach on the small island of Ikaria. This stretch made up of smooth pebbles that are easy to walk over is surrounded by stunning cliffs and the water is just as blue and warm as you’d expect especially in the summer months. This is however not a major tourist destination so make sure to pack out anything you’ve brought in and have the utmost respect for the locals along the way.

Myrtos Beach Kefalonia

Find yourself tucked between two mountains at Myrtos Beach on the island of Kefalonia located west of mainland Greece. This half-mile semicircle stretch sits at the base of towering limestone cliffs. Come for a swim explore the caves and stay to watch the spectacular sunset.

Red Beach Santorini

Discover another splash of color at Red Beach on the island of Santorini. The red volcanic rock mixed with the blue Aegean Sea is certainly a sight to behold from both near and far. However once you get down to the sand you’ll see it’s actually made up of a multitude of colors (mostly rich burgundy and dark blacks) making it even more extraordinary up close.

Apantima Beach Antiparos

What Apantima Beach lacks in size it more than makes up for in charm. This quaint beach on the island of Antiparos is a tiny stretch of pebble-filled shoreline that disappears into the gentle waters. It’s an excellent place for families with small children and those who are a little hungry as the beach is also home to Beach House a delightful dining venue serving locally sourced bites.

Plaka Beach Naxos

Find another perfect stretch of Grecian shoreline at Plaka Beach on the island of Naxos. This beach is rather famous so expect a crowd but that’s half the fun. Oh and don’t be surprised to see a few fellow travelers in the buff as this is a well-known nudist beach too.

Platys Gialos Beach Mykonos

Mykonos is chock-full of lovely beaches but Platys Gialos Beach may be the most convenient. This stretch of shore sits outside many of the island’s most popular hotels making it a breeze to hop out of bed and jump straight into the water.

Paliorema Milos

Those on the hunt for sandy beaches in Milos should head to Paliorema a quiet stretch tucked far away from the crowds. It can take a bit of work to reach (this spot isn’t accessible by car) but the solitude makes the journey well worth it.

Potami Beach Samos

Once again find yourself sandwiched between a lush landscape and the inviting blue Mediterranean waters at Potami Beach a pebbly spot on the island of Samos. There are plenty of umbrellas and loungers to rent but the best seat in the house is under the shade of a tree with your toes tucked right in the warm sand.

Possidi Cape Halkidiki

Those seeking a beach with a side of history should check out Possidi Cape located in Halkidiki a region in northern Greece. A gorgeous sandbar that stretches far out into the sea it's also very close to Mende an ancient city founded in the eighth century B.C. making it a prime spot for a little education meets relaxation.

Balos Crete

Balos isn’t just a beach — it's a lagoon. It's also a traveler favorite counting Prince Charles and Princess Diana as famous past visitors. Spend a day lazing on the soft white sand or floating in the calm waters.

Kolympithra Beach Tinos

Make your way to the tiny island of Tinos then keep going until you hit Kolimbithra Beach a quaint spot that's protected from the otherwise windy landscape. The beach is home to a small canteen in the summer months so you never have to travel far for snacks either.

Paleokastritsa Beach Corfu

Want a few Instagram-worthy photos? Visit Paleokastritsa Beach in Corfu one of Greece’s most picturesque destinations. Here you’ll find beautiful blue waters a craggy cliffside filled with caves for exploration and a few local taverns when you need a sip of something refreshing.

Astir Beach Athens

You don’t have to travel far to find a stellar beach in Greece. Astir Beach a complete paradise is just 20 minutes from the airport. The one caveat? It's actually a private beach making reservations a must but it’s worth splurging on an umbrella or a daybed.

Schinias Beach Athens

One more spot to visit near Athens — and this time for free — is Schinias Beach. Located close to Marathon this beach is ultra-convenient to reach and just as beautiful as you’d imagine. There are plenty of facilities here along with beach chairs and umbrellas to rent just in case you left your off your pack list.

They confirmed the reserves of black gold predicted by geologists within the North Goturdepe deposit and the shallow waters of the Caspian Sea and the area adjacent to them including the Central and Western Goturdepe areas.

– Advanced 3D seismic survey methods were used to detect promising and predictive-promising objects in separate blocks of North Goturdepe and blocks of West Goturdepe. Based on the results of the studies a geological report was compiled and recommendations were issued for drilling prospecting and exploration wells - explains acting. chief geologist of the State Corporation ""Türkmengeologiýa"" D. Meredov.

Expeditions of prospecting and exploratory drilling of the State Corporation ""Türkmengeologiýa"" at the North Goturdepe field began the construction of one prospecting (No. 19a) and two exploration (No. 7a No. 242) wells. As a result of the development of exploration well No. 19a by the Lebapnebitgazgözleg expedition commercial oil inflows and an increase in reserves were obtained. The well has been put into operation.

At present exploratory well No. 7a which was completed by the Balkannebitgazgözleg expedition also received industrial oil inflows and an increase in reserves from the lower red-colored strata of the Pliocene deposits of this field. The well has also been commissioned. In the future it is expected to receive inflows as well as an increase in oil reserves from the overlying medium red-colored strata of the Pliocene.

Another exploratory well No. 242 of the Lebapnebitgazgözleg expedition is at the final stage of drilling. According to the conducted geophysical studies of the well the passed section is also distinguished by its positive characteristics and in the future inflow and growth of oil reserves are expected.

In November of this year the subdivisions of the State Corporation ""Türkmengeologiýa"" began installation work of another exploration well No. 18a at the North Goturdepe field.

Geologists believe that prospecting and exploration work at this deposit will further provide an additional increase in black gold reserves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vYmVybmFtYS5jb20vZW4vYnVzaW5lc3MvbmV3cy5waHA_aWQ9MjE0NDc0OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MALAYSIAN SHIPPING STRUGGLING TO CATCH UP WHILE PORTS 'ANCHORS AWEIGH' FROM TROUBLED ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='bernama.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/business/news.php?id=2144749 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C491190520>, 'Connection to bernama.com timed out.

The billionaire developer has big plans to turn the failing Fashion District mall into a glimmering basketball palace. But first he’ll need to convince the neighbors that it won’t be one giant boondoggle.

On a Monday afternoon in October David Adelman stands at the corner of 11th and Market streets imagining an alternate universe. He points across the street at fast-fashion retailer Primark its logo glowing windshield-wiper-fluid blue in the distance. “So this” he says “is where the arena would go.”

Before we can consider the world in which there’s a $1.3 billion arena for the Philadelphia 76ers on the site of the Fashion District mall in the heart of Center City however we must face reality. Adelman in a military green bomber jacket dark pants and stylish leather boots his mane of thick black hair perfectly combed back begins to walk down Market Street. He passes a row of uninspired single-story retail — his future neighbors if all goes according to plan. There’s a dismal Panda Express a methadone clinic a boarded-up Reebok store and a closed-down pawnshop with a large red dumpster in front.

The Sixers have been trying to move for a while. In 2020 Josh Harris and David Blitzer the two New York finance billionaires who own the team proposed building a new arena plus 10 residential towers on Penn’s Landing. They also wanted more than $800 million in public subsidies. When that staggeringly bold plan flopped the Sixers approached Adelman who has more than a little development experience as CEO of student-housing behemoth Campus Apartments to dream up an entirely new arena project. One of the reasons Harris and Blitzer were so keen to move was simple: Billionaires prefer to be landlords not tenants and the Sixers were paying rent to Comcast for the right to play in the Wells Fargo Center. The 26-year-old facility was quickly becoming obsolete — especially by the standards of the NBA which has seen a spate of extravagant new arenas open in recent years. In turning to Adelman Harris and Blitzer enlisted a professional landlord to help make themselves into one.

Adelman also came highly recommended by Michael Rubin CEO of sports-apparel company Fanatics and until recently holder of the team’s third-largest ownership stake. If the Penn’s Landing proposal failed because it featured an out-of-town developer and a request for public subsidies this time would be different: Adelman who’s 50 has spent his entire life except for four years at Ohio State in the Philly region. A lifelong Sixers fan he’s had four courtside seats by the team’s bench for years. He told Harris and Blitzer “The only way I’d be interested is under the following circumstances: One we can’t take any city money. And two we can’t threaten to leave the city.” Harris and Blitzer agreed.

With that Adelman was in. He started scouting potential sites including around 30th Street Station and at Spring Garden and Front streets. Eventually he landed on Market East and the idea of demolishing the western half of the Fashion District mall a hideous gray box that has about as much appeal as the abandoned retail across the street from it. The site has advantages: It’s a transit hub with more than 220 different stops — from the Market-Frankford Line to Regional Rail to PATCO — feeding into Jefferson Station which sits beneath the mall. And Adelman felt this stretch of Market Street was an under-utilized no-man’s-land the missing link between Old City to the east and the shiny high-rise offices to the west. “I thought it was a civic obligation to help fix up the city and add an ­economic-development driver” he says. The Fashion District owners who’d poured $400 million into renovating it right before the pandemic hit were all too willing to have their monument to poor decision-making taken off their hands.

Now Adelman turns left and crosses the street to head into the mall grinning as we ride an escalator down to the bottom level. With a wild look in his eyes he declares that we’re now standing courtside. Where we’re actually standing is in a passageway between SEPTA’s Jefferson Station and the mall. “You’re going to be able to come out from the train station enter into the arena and then walk up” he says. If it’s built the 18500-seat space will disrupt and transform Center City in equal measure. If everything goes as planned it will open in 2031 when the team’s current lease expires.

If. If if if. There are lots of them. Just one block from the proposed arena is Chinatown a tight-knit community of 3000 Asian Americans that’s been bisected disrupted and nearly destroyed by various projects undertaken in the name of urban renewal and vague notions of the greater civic good. Few people in Chinatown are cheering the arena proposal. At their most sympathetic they’re open to the possibility of it being built while also deeply fearful that the project will jolt property values displace residents and business owners and erase the soul of the neighborhood. At their least sympathetic they’ve rejected the arena altogether and are organizing against it. Adelman has been meeting with community members in hopes of coming to an agreement on how the team can support Chinatown’s future and as it recently pledged in a local ad campaign “be a great neighbor.” Without such an agreement the project may well die in its infancy. City Councilmember Mark Squilla who represents the area says he “doesn’t see a way forward” without the agreement.

Adelman doesn’t feel daunted by the stakes. Why should he? He’s been on a winning streak lately: Tapped to build this project he also recently struck a deal with Rubin one of his best friends to buy out most of Rubin’s 10 percent stake in the franchise. Adelman is now the third largest owner of the team he rooted for as a kid. And he may just get to build their new home.

Still Adelman has never done anything like this before — not even close. His own family was skeptical his wife and two daughters asking if he knew how to build a project on this scale. He told them “No but I’ll figure it out!”

“I’ve built apartments I’ve built hotels I’ve built retail I’ve done all the components of this” Adelman says. “How many guys in the U.S. have built an arena? Twenty? Fifty? So I was like ‘Why not me?’”

•

Before the Sixers announced plans for the arena Adelman met with a number of Chinatown groups and community members to privately share what the team had in mind. He explained that by developing an existing commercial property he wouldn’t be displacing any residents; in fact he told them the Sixers want to increase affordable housing in the neighborhood.

Reactions to his outreach were mixed. John Chin head of the influential Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation a nonprofit that’s developed more than 600 affordable housing units in the neighborhood and funded other projects was confused. “My brain could not comprehend how the arena would fit on that site” he says. His fundamental view was — and still is — that “arenas and neighborhoods don’t mix.” According to Adelman former City Councilmember Helen Gym’s initial response was that she should have been informed of the project earlier. (A Gym spokesperson says Adelman mischaracterized this conversation and that her main concern was over a lack of community engagement.) Asian Americans United a long-standing activist group that previously organized against proposed Chinatown developments — Gym was once a member — didn’t have any reaction at all: It wasn’t informed beforehand. “Throwing a big proposal to Chinatown without asking the opinion of Chinatown — it’s not fair and it’s not respectful” says Wei Chen the group’s civic engagement coordinator. (Adelman and the Sixers have since met with group members.)

Adelman says he never bulldozed in with ultimatums and always intended to incorporate the community’s feedback; it simply wasn’t possible to meet with every community group before the announcement. “I’m the kind of person that if I made a mistake I would own it” Adelman says of the rollout. “There’s nothing about this I would do differently.” He thinks the arena still has more supporters than not. “If you looked at my LinkedIn page the day we announced 95 percent of the comments were positive” he says. “The texts I got from business leaders community leaders restaurant owners: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.”

But Adelman comes into Chinatown as an outsider and his first step didn’t exactly engender trust. Nor did it help when just over a week after the Sixers made their public announcement news broke that the team would also be purchasing the Greyhound bus station on Filbert Street one block north of the mall. By Chin’s definition of boundaries this meant the arena crossed the threshold into Chinatown. Adelman says public renderings always showed the arena extending into the bus terminal; he simply hadn’t highlighted it. But for community groups wary of encroachment this validated their concerns. Adelman admits the bus-station situation was a “foot fault” but chafes at the suggestion of impure motives. “That is a big stretch to say I’m displacing a Chinatown business and resident by buying the bus station” he says. “I don’t know if you’ve seen the bus station? It’s a piece of shit. It literally smells like urine as you walk by the street.” He contends that ultimately the arena is “not a Chinatown project.”

Whatever your definition Chinatown has a long fraught history of intrusive developments. In the 1970s PennDOT used eminent domain to seize more than 300 properties many in Chinatown to build the Vine Street Expressway which cut the neighborhood in half. In 1993 the city built the Convention Center on the western border displacing residents. Other ­projects — the original Gallery the Center City commuter tunnel linking Suburban Station and Market East — changed the area. Each time Chinatown residents were told how the projects would benefit them. More often than not they didn’t; such construction was rarely for their benefit. For every completed project there’s a story of one that Chinatown mobilized against: a prison a casino a Phillies stadium.

Then there’s the case of Washington D.C. with all its echoes. In 1994 Washington Bullets owner Abe Pollin announced his plans to build a new arena for his team in D.C.’s Chinatown. The Washington Post wrote that “some people voiced concerns about street access to the Chinatown location and the availability of parking” but that the dominant emotion was “genuine euphoria” and that “business leaders hailed the proposed complex as a catalyst for the revitalization of a beleaguered city.” Pollin was quoted as saying “I have faith in the future of this city and I am prepared to take the risk and get this done.” (He promised the arena would be privately financed; it ended up costing the city $50 million.)

The district’s Chinatown was already in decline in part due to the construction of a convention center in the neighborhood and the arena did little to stem the tide. Three thousand Asian people once lived in D.C.’s Chinatown; these days fewer than 500 do. Many of the surviving businesses are national chains that have replaced Chinese ones; their attempts at cultural awareness ring hollow. “It’s just ‘Chipotle’ written in Chinese” says Jenny Zhang an organizer for the Pennsylvania chapter of the Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance. A group of D.C. Chinatown residents published a recent op-ed in the Inquirer warning that “it isn’t a lack of tourism that kills Chinatown economies; it’s when Asian people stop coming because there is no parking or the businesses they rely on shut down.” The op-ed warned: “Don’t make the same mistake.”

But the D.C. Chinatown case “isn’t 100 percent comparable” says Dan Tsao a business owner in Philly’s Chinatown and community leader who also publishes newspapers in Chinese Vietnamese and Korean. Adelman has been trying to hammer home the same point. For one thing Pollin’s project created an arena where there was previously nothing of the sort. Adelman argues he’s merely switching one commercial use for another from mall to arena. Far from hurting businesses as D.C.’s arena did Adelman says he’ll add customers. He finds other parallels equally unconvincing. “The Phillies stadium 20 years ago would have been in the middle of Chinatown displacing properties and businesses” he says. “And I think the rallying cry that this is the same thing is inaccurate not fair and not reality.”

Adelman believes he can assuage many of the community’s concerns. “Right now there’s a public-safety issue going on in the city in general but in that area in particular” he says. “What we do here will help solve a lot of public safety by having people on the street. And two we can enhance lighting and cameras. And then three we have a real focus on making the community better and we’ll invest in affordable housing.” The Sixers have partnered with Mosaic Development Partners a Black-owned development firm with a track record of building mixed-income projects that don’t kick out longtime residents. Adelman meanwhile is attempting to convene a “community benefits steering committee” — a group of leaders representing the various constituencies in Chinatown that the Sixers will negotiate with in hopes of reaching an agreement. (Similar community benefits agreements were hashed out when the Phillies and Eagles built new stadiums in South Philly in the early 2000s and when Rivers Casino was erected in Northern Liberties; they typically involve the developers paying an annual sum — $1 million in the case of the South Philly stadium district — to fund projects at the community’s discretion.)

But how much stock to put in promises? Everyone from Adelman to Councilmember Squilla says a community benefits agreement must be reached for the arena to be built. (There’s a separate question of whether a representative sample of the community is even possible; Asian Americans United has already said it won’t participate in negotiations and is circulating a petition against the arena that it says has over 7000 signatures.) Because a project of this size will likely require zoning legislation which will need to be introduced by Squilla Chinatown has considerable leverage. But for now uncertainty reigns. Zhang contends that an arena will simply re-create the “dead-zone feel” of the Convention Center. “When nothing is happening no one is there and anyone who has walked past the Convention Center at night knows it doesn’t feel safe” she says. Chin likewise remains unconvinced. “I still have the same questions I did many weeks ago when I was first introduced to the project” he says. A community benefits agreement only fulfills its promise if the original community remains in place to reap those benefits.

And if there is no agreement? Adelman has mostly focused on what he can offer to Chinatown. In one conversation he took the opposite tack: “What happens if we don’t build the arena? What’s the path for that mall when you think about the fact that it’s in decline? What if it heads to a bankruptcy and it sits empty?”

He declines to say whether his deal with the mall owner has a contingency clause in the event the arena doesn’t move forward but he mentions that the current zoning on Market Street allows any developer to build residential towers by right no special permission required. “What if someone knocks it down and by right can build three Comcast towers?” Adelman asks. He says there’s a “naivete in the community” about the public-safety problems along Market Street: “No one wants to talk about what could happen here vs. the economic input this has.” The Sixers he says want to invest in public safety and affordable housing. “What other impetus would there be to solve those problems and anchor and bolster the community? I can’t think of one.”

When Adelman was 11 he challenged a family friend to a game of basketball. The friend was Alan Horwitz who happened to run a small real estate empire in West Philadelphia by the name of Campus Apartments. The two made a wager on the game. “Most people let the 11-year-old win” Adelman says. “He didn’t.”

This would prove significant: It was Adelman’s entrée into real estate. As the story he often tells goes he lost his basketball and baseball glove and began working at Campus Apartments to earn them back. He got hooked. Real estate he says was like “a fascination and an addiction merged together.” He officially became a landlord for the first time at 13 when he had $2000 in bar mitzvah money to spend and sank it into one of Horwitz’s apartment buildings. Adelman who grew up on the Main Line — his father was a psychologist; his mother stayed home — continued to work at Campus during the summers. He gave tours to prospective tenants painted did other odd jobs. One year he had an epiphany: He’d messed up and hit a plumbing line and now excrement was spewing everywhere. “I remember thinking to myself I don’t want to be the guy standing in shit when I’m older” he says. Fortunately he was family friends with the CEO and had an in. After four years away for college at Ohio State he returned to Philly in 1994 and started working at Campus Apartments immediately.

Adelman had visions of being more than a local landlord. In 2000 he struck a deal with Penn to manage all of its off-campus housing thinking if he could do it for Penn he could do it for anyone. Horwitz slightly confused as to why his protégé was so keen on rocking the boat was content to step back. Adelman became CEO of the company before he turned 30.

“He’s kinetic energy personified” says Campus Apartments chief investment officer Dan Bernstein who’s worked with Adelman for 25 years. When Adelman first wanted to expand the company he considered taking it public but ultimately decided to take on private investment. He went on a pitching bonanza and convinced the public investment fund of Singapore to give him $300 million which prompted new projects nationwide. “I’d never raised a dollar before” Adelman says. The company now owns more than $2 billion in real estate.

When Adelman took over Campus Apartments the neighborhood around Penn was in crisis. Crime was high; in the span of two years a grad student had been murdered an undergrad had been shot and a research associate had been stabbed to death — all in robberies. “West Philly was going to hell in a handbasket” says Drexel president John Fry a Penn executive at the time. Fry decided to create a business improvement district to fund amenities like lighting and foot patrols. He went around to various landlords asking for support and couldn’t get a meeting with one exception: David Adelman. Fry made his pitch. Adelman said “Well how much do you need?” and committed $50000 on the spot. Twenty-five years later Adelman still serves on the University City District board.

In conversations about the arena Adelman cites the University City District as a raging success. “I watched the effect firsthand of what a coordinated effort around public safety and cleanliness does” he says. “I can help deliver that to Chinatown and Washington West right now and it won’t cost the city anything.” But his tenure as Campus Apartments CEO coincided with significant gentrification in West Philly. The Spruce Hill neighborhood was 65 percent Black in 2000; that fell to 22 percent per 2020 census data. Median home prices have risen from under $200000 in 2000 to nearly $600000. “I think everyone whether we’re talking about David or we’re talking about Penn or the other universities we have to admit that there should have been much more of an intentional focus on anti-displacement strategies on equity on making sure Black and brown working-class folks can live and access all benefits” says City Councilmember Jamie Gauthier who represents much of West Philly. “I hope that folks who have seen including David what’s going on in West Philly come at development with a different perspective now.”

Adelman says he supports affordable housing requirements for new construction projects but if there were missteps in West Philly he doesn’t see them committed by Campus Apartments the University City District or Penn which offered low-interest mortgages to staff to encourage them to buy homes there. “I actually think it was the opposite effect” he says “where an organized effort by an institution providing capital infrastructure and services stabilized the area.” He steers the conversation back to the arena. “Look what’s happening right now at 10th and Market where you have shootings all the time and random acts of violence in the mall.” (There was one gunshot fired in the mall in September — no one was hit — and according to police there has been one shooting victim in the two-block radius surrounding the proposed arena so far this year.) Adelman goes on “I see a similar problem that needs to be solved.”

Adelman rides up the escalator from Brooklyn’s Atlantic Terminal subway stop and the Barclays Center comes into view: large brown shaped like a futuristic toilet seat. “The energy is amazing” he says stepping onto the plaza in front of the arena. As part of his research he’s been touring other arenas across the country; today he and a few Sixers employees are checking out the Nets’ facilities while catching their first pre-season game of the year which happens to be against the Sixers.

Across the street from the arena is a strip of retail. A Barclays Center employee giving the tour explains that these used to be mom-and-pop shops; now they’re a Chick Fil-A a Snipes and a facade with an ad reading BROOKLYN FLAGSHIP REDEVELOP — COMING 2020. Adelman marching through spitting rain looks over and says quietly “This could be better.”

Inside the arena Adelman strides through the main concourse which maintains Brooklyn’s chic color scheme of black and gray and dim lighting. Occasionally the concessions stands stop and you catch a glimpse of the court; it’s like staring into an amphitheater. There’s a pop-up zone where local businesses can set up on a rotating basis — maybe something like that could exist in Philly for Chinatown restaurants Adelman muses. He admires a Grab and Go store where you tap your credit card and the system automatically knows what to charge you — no checkout required.

The tour moves on to the luxurious suites at the arena: an outpost of the 40/40 Club which is owned by Jay-Z with plenty of gold trim and bird’s-eye views of the court. There’s the Qatar Club with windows looking out on the players’ tunnel. And most swankily there’s the Crown Club a space so opulent it’s as if you’ve teleported through the looking glass into a five-star restaurant: plush banquettes chandeliers gold wallpaper depicting a scene of flowers and birds. There’s even a dedicated candy “pantry” where fans can grab anything they want.

At dinner at the Crown Club a server informs us that Nets owner and Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai has graciously selected wine for our evening: a 2018 Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru ($395 a bottle) and a 2017 Gevrey-Chambertin Premier Cru ($325 a bottle). A feast from the Italian restaurant Carbone ensues: spicy rigatoni veal parmesan radicchio salad shrimp scampi with fennel. You’d be forgiven for forgetting there’s a basketball game to come. “How do we even reciprocate to the Nets when they come to Philly?” Adelman asks the other Sixer employees at one point somewhere between sheepish and joking. “Give them hot dogs?” (Adelman while appreciative of the Barclays Center largesse says this level of bougie-ness would never work in the Philly market. “I have a different vision” he says.)

After dinner Adelman makes his way to his seat. He typically posts a picture for his 40000 Instagram followers before every Sixers game he attends but this time he’s in the ninth row which for him practically amounts to Siberia. “If I post from here people might think the recession has already started” he jokes. (He ends up posting a zoomed-in shot of the Jumbotron.) After two quarters — a chunk of it spent on his phone reviewing a work presentation — bad weather is coming and Adelman is due back in Philly the next morning; he works out at 6 a.m. sharp daily and has a boxing session with a personal trainer scheduled. He rushes to a black car waiting at the loading dock; the car ascends the elevator to the street level then deposits him at a pier on Wall Street. He marches to a helipad and flies off to Philly — takeoff to touchdown in just 30 minutes.

A few days later I take a tour of the Wells Fargo Center at Adelman’s suggestion with a group of Sixers PR officials. Everyone is perfectly kind and respectful to the Comcast landlords but the subtext is clear: You’ve seen the Barclays; now look at the shithole we’re in.

The tour begins with the players’ locker room. Modern locker rooms these days have LED screens and chargers for players; here there are none. The Sixers have one TV in the entire space. Down a linoleum-floored hallway that looks like the basement of a high school we enter the weight room. The Sixers share this area with the Flyers but it’s not big enough to fit both teams’ equipment so someone has to wheel the Flyers’ stationary bikes out of the room before games. The trainer’s room where players take ice baths looks like a morgue. Until recently when the team converted some office space there was no place for Sixers to eat pre-game. There’s no place for chefs to cook pre-game meals for visiting teams; I saw them lined up in a hallway stirring fried rice in a giant wok.

This has its competitive disadvantages if you consider that each time an opposing player enters your arena it’s a chance to show off (or in this case not show off) your state-of-the-art facilities — subliminal free-agency recruitment. The Sixers are paying out of their own pocket for a $9 million renovation to expand and relocate the team’s locker room but the building is the building and there’s only so much you can do. “It’s like putting lipstick on a pig” says a Sixers employee. Separately Comcast is overseeing a $360 million renovation which has included updates to things like plumbing and HVAC as well as to public-facing portions of the arena. (A back-of-the-house revamp including the remaining locker rooms is also planned.) There are now restaurants from Stephen Starr Jose Garces and Marc Vetri inside the arena but they’re all on the club level way up where the corporate suites used to be back when the arena was first built. These days basketball diehards want to be close to the action.

After the tour I catch another Sixers pre-season game with Adelman this one against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Adelman runs into Cavs forward Kevin Love pre-game and hugs him. Whether through proximity to people like Michael Rubin who’s an A-list networker and friends with people like Drake and James Harden or just by sheer proximity to the court over the years Adelman has for a real estate guy attained an unusual level of closeness to celebrity. In fairness he isn’t just a real estate guy anymore. In 2007 he co-founded the investment firm FS Investments alongside fellow Philadelphian Michael Forman. (FS now constitutes the single largest portion of his net worth which Business Insider recently estimated at $1.6 billion.) And for the past 15 years Adelman has had his own venture capital fund Darco Capital investing in a range of companies from highly sustainable and buzzy (the world’s first carbon-neutral milk) to not so sustainable but still buzzy (private-jet service Wheels Up). He even has his own line of spirits: a vodka distilled in Idaho and a whiskey distilled in Houston.

These days many athletes seek out business guys for advice. Adelman has brought LeBron James Tobias Harris and Russell Wilson into some of his investments — part of the appeal behind friendship with someone like him. “I think one of the big problems with a lot of rich people is they’re painfully boring” Rubin says. “David’s not like that. David’s fun he’s young he’s vibrant he’s got a good personality.” Adelman has been to Rubin’s tabloid-bonanza “white party” in the Hamptons during the summer alongside the likes of Jay-Z Beyoncé Drake and Kendall Jenner. Adelman has also made rounds in the film world; his wife Hallee is a documentary-film producer and the duo have attended film festivals like Sundance. “She’s the creative type; I’m just the dumb capitalist” Adelman jokes.

Those closest to Adelman rave about his generosity. He’s surprised friends with sudden-notice private-jet trips to the Masters golf tournament in Georgia and a Genesis concert in London. At the Sixers game I saw him order a chicken cheesesteak and a cheeseburger and tip the server $100. (Adelman is a health nut and generally eschews bread; he ate the cheesesteak filling off the roll with a fork.) On the court he ordered a soft pretzel — another $100 tip. Though he’s grown richer and more famous his personality hasn’t changed according to John Fry: “There’s none of that bullshit that ego. There’s no brashness. I mean David knows what he’s accomplished; he’s gonna need a healthy ego. But it’s a healthy ego. He’s not the guy who swaggers into the room and tells you how great he is. I’ve never seen that. And honestly I’ve seen that from a lot of people who have accomplished a quarter of what David has accomplished.”

As Adelman watches the Sixers go through pre-season motions against the Cavs he explains how his new arena will be different. “We designed it from the sight lines in vs. from the court out” he says. That means seats will be sloped at the ideal angle for basketball-viewing unlike at the Wells Fargo Center which was designed for hockey. (The new arena will accommodate hockey too just in case the Flyers and Comcast ever want to cut bait; Comcast has been offered an ownership stake.) The building which has a quasi-pyramid shape with grass and solar panels on the roof will feature retail and restaurants facing the street that will open to the public on non-game nights. (The Sixers play just 41 regular-­season home games each year although the arena could also host concerts and other events.) A stretch of Filbert Street will be lined with food vendors and convert to a covered pedestrian market on off-days. “I feel like people in Philly don’t think they should have nice things” Adelman says. “We deserve nice things. We’re going to have a great place.” He laments the Philly trait of “just getting by with the status quo.” This applies as much to what the arena looks like as to where it is. Despite plenty of fretting over where fans — especially suburban ones — will park downtown Adelman says that 20 percent of Sixers fans already take SEPTA to games and that half come from Center City. (So far this season transit ridership has been closer to seven percent according to SEPTA figures.) Per the team’s surveys an estimated 50 percent would take transit or walk to the new arena and just 3150 parking spots — less than half the current number — would be required. “I know that I’m kind of going against 50 years of muscle memory of people going into South Philadelphia” Adelman says. “But that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.”

•

Adelman frames the arena in symbolic practically existential terms. “We’re the poorest big city education gun violence” he says rattling off woes. “It makes people always count Philly out. We need this. We need to be a beacon of hope. People need to know we’re not giving up.” Adelman will be investing his own money here — $300 million to $400 million split between himself Harris and Blitzer — and says his motivations are more civic than financial. (A quick word about those finances: While the Sixers initially pledged the arena would be privately funded Adelman has since opened up the door to taking state or federal dollars; the only red line he says is taking city funds.) “This is going to be one of the biggest personal checks I ever write for a single investment anywhere and I’m doing it in Philadelphia” he says. “That’s how committed I am to this. There’s a lot of money in the world. That’s a lot of money for David Adelman okay?”

It’s undeniably shrewd to have a Philadelphian leading the arena development this time around. Adelman’s varied business and civic commitments — he also chairs the board of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia — have helped him cultivate connections to many of the city’s most influential figures. Ryan Boyer head of the city’s building trades calls him “a genius an innovator.” Mayor Jim Kenney declined an interview request but said in a statement that “it was exciting to hear the proposal for Fashion District Philadelphia as we believe it has the potential to be an ideal site for a world-class sports and entertainment arena.” Adelman says the Mayor was “ecstatic” about the proposal.

Given the project’s timeline Adelman’s relationship with the next mayor figures to be even more important. “They’ve done a good job meeting with all the potential serious mayoral candidates being agnostic on who they support and making sure they support the project” Boyer says of Adelman and the Sixers. Whether Adelman is himself agnostic isn’t clear. He can’t donate directly to city candidates due to his involvement with FS Investments and restrictions affecting asset managers but he attended a dinner hosted by prospective candidate Jeff Brown the supermarket owner who’s the darling of the city’s business class. Adelman downplays his attendance saying he’s “spent time with lots of the folks that are considering a run just because I care about the city.” Despite his friendliness with city Democrats he’s lived in Haverford for the past 16 years and is a registered Republican having made federal donations to everyone from Marco Rubio and Brian Fitzpatrick to Bob Casey and Susan Wild. “Honestly I wish I could be a registered centrist” he says.

Maybe the biggest advantage the Sixers have in Adelman is that very few people seem to dislike him — no small feat considering the two words that first come to mind when describing him are “billionaire” and “developer.” Progressive Councilmember Gauthier calls him a “good friend” though they agree on virtually nothing and many of her bills on Council including a zoning law that mandates affordable housing units in all new large construction projects directly impact Campus Apartments. “I think the fact that we have a relationship allows us to talk through some very difficult issues and to land on at least some semblance of common ground” she says. “We’re not coming to the table as enemies; we’re coming to the table as friends who just often see the world differently.” Ali Perelman who runs Philadelphia 3.0 the nonprofit that spends on City Council races — Adelman helps fund its expenditures that aren’t on political ­campaigns — describes him as a “very menschy dude. … In Philly it’s tough to find people that are universally well-liked. We have so many camps and factions and grudges and all that BS. That alone is kind of a distinguishing characteristic of this person.”

Perhaps that’s why Adelman feels he may yet win over some of his biggest skeptics — even Helen Gym. “If we get the community benefits agreement right and she sees I’m not full of shit who knows?” he says. “I think everything is on the table.” Gym declined to comment.

•

By early November everything was still on the table. Negotiations with Chinatown were proceeding in fits and starts but the contours of the discussions were emerging. Adelman and the Sixers have been to Chinatown between 20 and 25 times according to Tsao the business owner and publisher to talk and meet with various groups. He and other business owners insisted that if the team was going to follow through with its covered-market plan for Filbert Street Chinatown restaurant owners should be first in line to lease any space for Asian concepts. The Sixers agreed. Tsao also raised the concern that existing business owners could be forced to compete against national brands for their leases; he says the Sixers agreed to consider creating a fund for business owners to offset potential rent increases. Tsao has found Adelman to be a willing negotiator. “Even though David Adelman is a billionaire he hasn’t put off any attitude” he says. By his estimate 95 percent of community leaders in Chinatown are still “not taking any position” on the proposal and waiting to learn more.

The Sixers meanwhile have been proactive. One of Tsao’s media outlets published an article about Asian Americans United’s strong opposition to the arena project. The piece was written in Chinese and only accessible via WeChat the social media app used by Chinese people worldwide. The next day someone from the Sixers reached out to Tsao asking to provide a response to the critiques in the story.

Slowly the community benefits steering committee has been coming into focus. According to Tsao there will be between 13 and 15 members: four umbrella community groups including the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation; three business owners including himself; three Chinatown residents; and three religious organizations. AAU has been invited to join; it declined. “We’re still at phase one” Tsao says. Phase two should involve more specifics: raw numbers economic impact studies. “Then I think the whole negotiation is going to be escalated to a different level” he says. Eventually the Sixers will expand the discussion to include neighborhoods and businesses outside Chinatown as well. Adelman tells me the Sixers will soon be proposing a $50 million payment as the centerpiece of its community benefits agreement. The money — a mix of cash up front and funds to be paid out over 30 years — would mostly go to projects in Chinatown. But what projects? And is $50 million enough?

A few weeks earlier Adelman stood at the intersection of 10th and Filbert his tour of the mall and the would-be arena concluded. This stretch of road might eventually be his imagined pedestrian marketplace. The underperforming stores on the south side of Market Street might one day be replaced with housing and retail that’s actually open. But for now the first community benefits steering committee meeting Adelman’s chance to pitch the team’s $50 million proposal loomed. Something would happen at the meeting — however it ended up going — and knowing how much opposition he is or isn’t up against would constitute progress. “I might get the shit kicked out of me!” Adelman said. He smiled then turned and walked up 10th Street into the distance passing beneath an overpass that read for now in giant letters FASHION DISTRICT.

WELL,Welltower,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ja25pZ2h0cy5jb20vYmxvZ3MvZ3Vlc3QtY29sdW1ucy9hbi1hbmFseXNpcy1vZi1wcmVwLWFjdC1pbW11bml0eS1mb3ItbHRjLWZhY2lsaXRpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An analysis of PREP Act immunity for LTC facilities,"Norris Cunningham

A host of lawsuits over the past two years involve nursing homes where patients or their estates allege that patients contracted COVID-19 due to the facilities’ negligence or failure to properly act.

Generally these lawsuits allege that the facilities failed to enforce social distancing failed to follow proper infection control protocols and guidelines and failed to take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Procedurally these cases get filed in state court and claim negligence or wrongful death as facilities are used to seeing. However the defendant nursing homes file to transfer the case to federal court arguing that the case presents a federal question under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act. Plaintiffs argue that the PREP Act does not apply and move to remand the case back to state court.

Many federal district courts have found that the PREP Act does not apply to the case even considering the Advisory Opinions of the Office of General Counsel (OGC) of the Department of Health & Human Services which stated that the PREP Act is a complete preemption statute and that nursing homes are entitled to its immunity if they are providing or allocating covered countermeasures.

However not all courts agree with OGC on whether the PREP Act applies and those courts have not granted nursing homes the requested relief.

Most recently the United States Supreme Court decided not to take up the case of Saldana v. Glenhaven Healthcare. There the resident lived at Glenhaven for six years before dying of COVID-related causes in May 2020. His family sued the nursing home for not doing enough to protect him from the virus and the nursing home tried to have the case moved to federal court to take advantage of immunity under the PREP Act. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Glenhaven’s argument and remanded the case back to state court.

Angela Rinehart

Federal district courts in New York Kansas California and Florida along with several other district courts have all found that state law claims of negligence and wrongful death were not federal question claims under the PREP Act and remanded their respective matters back to state court.

Contrary to the above the Central District of California issued an order in Gilbert Garcia et al. v. Welltower OpCo Group LLC et al. The district court found that the PREP Act served as complete immunity for the nursing home defendants and barred the plaintiffs’ claims against them. The plaintiffs alleged that during the pandemic the facility allowed outside visitors sent “mixed messages” about PPE resumed group dining and allowed a barber to enter the facility after a staff member tested positive for the virus among other things. Plaintiff later tested positive for the virus and was taken to the emergency room where he died a few weeks later.

Defendants argued that the PREP Act provided a basis for immunity at the pleadings stage. Plaintiffs argued that the PREP Act did not apply to the case but the court disagreed. Now in light of the Saldana opinion on Nov. 18 2022 the 9th Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in Garcia and remanded for reconsideration.

While valid arguments exist as to why the PREP Act should provide immunity to long-term care providers in these types of cases the recent Supreme Court decision to pass on Saldana will certainly force more of these cases to be heard in state court and the split between the various federal courts will remain. Long-term care providers must remain hopeful that the right case is out there and the Supreme Court will revisit this issue and resolve the split among the lower courts.

This allows more gamers to increase their system storage by leaps without spending a ton of money on the latest silicon.

Multiple leading storage manufacturers including Western Digital Silicon Power Crucial Team Group and more are coming up with new entries that rewrite the definition of value.

Thus now is the best time to snag one of the leading storage devices on the market. In this list we have compiled the best storage device options to make it easier for gamers to spot the options best tailored to their use case.

A guide to purchasing the best budget-friendly SSDs

5) Western Digital Green 1 TB SATA internal SSD ($59.99)

Western Digital is one of the leading manufacturers in the storage space. Their Green series is meant to be a budget low-power consuming alternative to the more extreme Blue and Black series.

Thus it is no surprise that the 1 TB variant of the drive is among the cheapest options in the market. This drive performs well and keeps up pretty well when compared to other options on the market. The SSD packs 540 MB/s and 430 MB/s read and write speeds respectively.

Most gamers can opt for the WD Green storage drive and call it a day.

4) Solidigm P41 Plus Series 1TB PCIe M.2 Gen 3 x4 SSD ($59.99)

The Solidigm P41 Plus Series 1TB PCIe M.2 Gen 3 x4 (Image via Newegg)

Many readers might not have heard about Solidigm. The company bought out Intel's storage device department and the P41 series was their first launch in the consumer SSD market.

Thus it is safe to assume that the P41 Plus series is a rehashed Intel Optane drive. Being a budget option it is based on the PCIe Gen 3 interface. It packs 4125 MB/s and 2950 MB/s read and write speeds respectively.

On a budget it is one of the best solid-state drives to opt for.

3) Silicon Power 1TB NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 M.2 2280 TLC SSD ($63.38)

The Silicon Power 1TB NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 M.2 2280 (Image via Newegg)

The Silicon Power 1TB NVMe is based on the PCIe Gen 3 form factor. It packs a high-quality Phison E12 controller. It packs DDR4 DRAM and costs just $0.06 per GB making it one of the best budget storage devices to opt for.

It comes with read and write speeds of 3400MB/s and 3000MB/s respectively. This makes it one of the fastest Gen 3 storage devices available albeit slightly slower than the Solidigm option listed above.

2) Team Group MP33 M.2 2280 1TB PCIe Gen 3 x4 SSD ($64.99)

The Team Group MP33 M.2 2280 1TB PCIe Gen 3 x4 (Image via Newegg)

Team Group has been making some high-quality storage devices over the past couple of years. Based on the PCIe Gen 3 interface the MP33 is one of the slowest NVMe storage devices on this list. It reads and writes at 1800 Mbps and 1500 Mbps respectively.

It is powered by the Micron 96L TLC controller and it is DRAM-less. This makes it one of the lowest-quality budget-friendly storage devices available.

However the Team Group MP33 is very budget-friendly. It is backed by a five-year-long warranty. But it is much faster than any SATA storage device available.

1) Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA internal SSD ($69.99)

The Crucial BX500 is a budget SATA storage device offered by the storage manufacturer. This device is a DRAM-less storage device similar to the Team Group solid-state drive mentioned above.

The drive is controlled by the Silicon Motion SM2259XT. This solid-state storage device is a low-performing option but it has currently been discontinued from its $114 MSRP to just $70 making it a good option to opt for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vamFtZXMtd2VzdC1taWNyb3Bob25lLWJsYWNrLXBhbnRoZXItbmFhY3AtaW52ZW50aW9uLWthbnllLXdlc3QtMjAyMi0xMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kanye West Claimed Hitler Invented the Microphone.

Ye formerly known as Kanye West inflamed further controversy on Thursday when he spoke about Adolf Hitler during an interview with Alex Jones. West who was re-suspended from Twitter on Friday after tweeting an image of a swastika inside a star of David also falsely claimed Hitler invented the microphone.

But most microphones in use today are thanks to James West an African American inventor who has more than 250 patents to his name. The grandson of a formerly enslaved person West also attended Black Panther meetings during college.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

In 1962 West co-invented the foil electret microphone which 90% of all microphones used today — including telephones music recording equipment and hearing aids — are based on. The electret microphone doesn't require a battery and became widely used for its high performance accuracy low cost and small size.

Sparking an interest in electricity

West was born on February 10 1931 in his family's home because the whites-only local hospital would not admit Black Americans. His father Samuel Edward was an entrepreneur of sorts holding a range of jobs that included a funeral home owner an insurance salesman and a railroad porter. West's mother Matilda West was a schoolteacher who taught on Native American reservations and worked for a time at the Langley Air Force Base during World War II.

Growing up West was expected to work at his uncle's medical clinic which served mostly the Black community.

""My father's family felt very strongly that the direction in education should be in the four professions at that time open to Black people"" West told Johns Hopkins Magazine in 2003. ""Lawyer doctor teacher and preacher — we had all of them in the family.""

But West pursued a different path which began after he was almost electrocuted.

When West was about 10 years old he had found an old radio discarded near his home in rural Virginia. Wanting to see if it still worked he brought it home and reached for an electrical outlet. It was a humid day and the outlet sent sparks rattling through his body from head to toe.

""It was terribly intriguing from a standpoint of how electricity worked"" West told Johns Hopkins. ""I had to learn more about that.""

Becoming more immersed in Black emancipation

From a young age West was exposed to the Black freedom movement. His grandmother was formerly enslaved and his parents were both active in organizations that advocated for the emancipation of Black people.

""[W.E.B.] Du Bois was one of the people I learned about early in life. All of this has been part of my upbringing. It's a very important part of why I'm interested in diversity"" West said in his interview with Johns Hopkins Magazine.

West's mother lost her job at the Langley Air force Base due to her involvement in the NAACP which Joseph McCarthy decried as communist and a threat to America. She later became one of the ""Hidden Figures"" who were instrumental in helping NASA develop their space program.

At Temple University where he studied physics West read works by Leon Trotsky and began attending Black Panther meetings.

""I became more immersed in racist attitudes toward Black people."" West said. ""Living in Philadelphia I saw a whole different perspective from the standpoint of poverty and the deplorable situations in which some people are forced to survive. I lost confidence in the system.""

Advocating for minorities in science

West has remained devoted to uplifting minorities values instilled in him by his family. In the 1970s he was a member of the Association of Black Laboratories Employees at Bell Labs where he invented the microphone that pushed to fund research programs to help more than 500 non-white students graduate with degrees in STEM.

The inventor also pioneered groundbreaking research that helped the Black community. In the late 1980s West and his colleagues at Cornell University and Bell Labs developed a way to more accurately read blood pressure. West said he was motivated by the fact that heart disease and hypertension rates are higher among African Americans.

West has also studied the acoustic environment of hospitals finding that loud noise levels affect staff and patients. He has also worked on a device to detect pneumonia in lungs of young children — ultimately fulfilling albeit in a roundabout and perhaps unintentional way his father's wishes for his son to pursue medicine.

""It all comes back"" West said. ""It's all circular.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8va2FzaG1pcm9ic2VydmVyLm5ldC8yMDIyLzEyLzAzL2FpbWluZy1mb3ItdXAtYW5kLWNvbWluZy1jYXJlZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aiming for Up-and-coming Careers – Kashmir Observer,Quality journalism takes a lot of time money and hard work to produce and despite all the hardships we still do it.

A quick search on eBay and Amazon reveals dozens of listings with everything from shirts and hoodies to hats and flip-flops ... all with either Kanye's imagery or his Ye24 slogan. It's unclear exactly who's selling the stuff ... whether it's Kanye or 3rd parties. Pricing ranges from $20-30 for hats up to $50 for hoodies and flip-flops plus shipping.

While we've yet to see any designs of Kanye with a swastika or anything Hitler-adjacent some merch includes Ye holding a cross and another where he's standing next to Iron Man.

As for the resale value of Yeezy shoes those have remained shockingly unchanged -- despite Kanye's proclamation of loving Hitler and giving props to Nazis.

Research from partners Monne Williams and Bryan Hancock and senior partner Lareina Yee found that while three in four frontline workers want to be promoted only one in four will achieve it.

In 2020 a ROKiT-branded white and red race car was unveiled by the team. However due to the COVID-19 health crisis it was unable to be driven. Even though the season was supposed to resume in July 2020 the company ended its commitments with the team during the pandemic. The team's owners then decided to seek legal action in the British court to receive the contracted amount. While the mobile phone company argued that the team had breached its contractual obligations the London International Arbitration Court still ordered ROKiT to pay several million dollars.

A second procedure before the Californian court.

In the summer of 2021 the Williams team was sold to the American investment fund Dorilton Capital which did not facilitate the procedure. However the condemned company still does not pay the amount specified in the judgment. The Williams team then brings the case before the California court this time in December 2021.

Leonardo DiCaprio Kim Kardashian Kylie Jenner Serena Williams and a slew of other A-listers celebrated Art Basel Miami’s 20th year at Wayne and Cynthia Boich’s star-studded party on Friday night.

“Everyone who was anyone was there” one partygoer told Page Six of the annual “After Dark” party at the Boichs’ private mansion which kicked off with a nearly 1-hour performance by 50 Cent.

The legendary rapper took the stage at around 11 p.m. to perform his big hits including “Candy Shop” “Just a Lil Bit” “P.I.M.P.” “In Da Club” and “Disco Inferno.”

Meanwhile DiCaprio who has been making the rounds on the Art Basel party circuit arrived to the festivities via boat and in his signature baseball cap.

The movie star 48 was seen enjoying himself on the crowded dance floor with close pal Tobey Maguire during 50 Cent’s performance before making their way to a VIP table.

We hear DiCaprio who was seen dancing among a sea of models was approached by a fan who tried to say “hi” but the person accidentally walked into a pool of water on his way there.

“This poor guy totally ruined his shoes for Leo” a spy mused adding “It was probably worth it.”

5 Leonardo DiCaprio sat at a VIP table surrounded by his entourage.

Across the crowd Kim 42 and her sister Khloé Kardashian 38 were seen partying at their own VIP table with Venus and Serena Williams.

One insider shared that the Kardashian sisters pulled up to the party as 50 Cent was leaving and convinced the rapper to get back on stage for a second set.

“Kim and Khloé Kardashian walked into the mansion to be escorted to their friend’s table and as they were walking they saw Wayne Boich 50 Cent and Serena Williams talking” the source said.

“50 said he was headed out and [Kim and Khloé] responded ‘Did we miss your set?’ prompting the rapper to ask ‘Do you wanna see it? Good let’s go.'”

50 Cent proceeded to go on stage for round two with Kim Khloé Jonathan “Foodgod” Cheban and restaurateur David Grutman by his side for the surprise encore. The rapper also passed out shots of Branson cognac to guests inside the house.

But the special performances didn’t stop there. Travis Scott was seen arriving and taking shots with Kylie Jenner before hitting the stage at the posh soirée.

“During his set he pulled up the host Wayne Boich and Dwyane Wade to throw back a shot of Don Julio 1942 with him” an insider said.

The “Sicko Mode” rapper was seen making out with Jenner with whom he shares two kids in the DJ booth.

He also performed many of his biggest tracks including “Goosebumps” “Highest in the Room” and “No Bystanders.”

We’re told Venus 42 was seen grabbing cocktails at one of the bars for the “normal attendees” before going to Kim’s VIP section.

Cuba Gooding Jr. seemed to be having the best time at the party and was going up to random guests to strike up a conversation.

At one point he surprised attendees by taking over the stage for a killer karaoke set in which he belted out Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing.”

“That was for you Travis!” the “Jerry Maguire” star 54 said into the mic before exiting the stage and moshing with Scott and Zack Bia to beats by Chase B.

When DJ duo Sofi Tukker got on stage to spin beats Khloé and Sean “Diddy” Combs were seen salsa dancing inside the Boichs’ stunning living room of their waterfront estate.

“It was honestly the most epic party of Art Basel” a giddy guest gushed to a friend.

Other A-list guests at the Art Week bash included Jared Leto Anastasia Karanikolaou Bobby Shmurda Michael Bay Dave Portnoy Karolina Kurkova Shane Battier Rande Gerber Justine Skye Matt Barnes The Chainsmokers Daymond John Floyd Mayweather Hannah Bronfmon Brendan Fallis Skepta Dwyane Wade Gabrielle Union and artist Hebru Brantley.

We’re told over 1000 people were turned away from the door.

Prior to the exclusive event several heavy hitters enjoyed a private dinner with Wayne and Cynthia including Related Group’s Bruce Beal Equinox’s Harvey Spevak Shuttershock CEO Jon Oringer Marc Packer Casamigos co-founder Rande Gerber Catch co-founders Eugene Remm and Mark Birnbaum Orlando Bravo Andrew Mathias of SL Green Josh Wander Michael and Nikki Simkins and La Fête Wine Company owner Donae Burston.

The decadent meal was paired with cocktails by Haig Club Don Julio and champagne by Armand de Brignac.

A Las Vegas judge on Friday ruled Yoni Barrios 32 must remain at a state psychiatric facility until a court-appointed psychiatrist can determine whether he is mentally competent to stand trial according to court records.

Barrios was charged with two counts of open murder with a deadly weapon and six counts of attempted murder in the senseless broad-daylight attack on October 6.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said Barrios stabbed showgirl Maris Digiovanni in the heart and bystander Brent Hallet with a kitchen knife near the Wynn hotel.

Barrios also allegedly stabbed six others including showgirls Anna Westby and Victoria Cayetano.

According to a police report obtained by The Post Barrios went into the Wynn looking for a job. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed Barrios a Guatemalan national was in the country illegally.

Police said Barrios spoke to a security guard at the Wynn and said he wanted to sell the knives he had in his possession so he could obtain some money to go back to his country.

The guard told him to “jump in front of a train” according to the police report.

An enraged Barrios then approached the showgirls later telling police they laughed and made fun of his clothing.

“Barrios said he became angry and stabbed one of the women [Digiovanni] in the chest after which he began stabbing the other women in the group as they ran away” the police report said.

“Barrios started running and looking for groups of people so he could ‘let the anger out.’”

If the court determines Barrios is competent the criminal case will proceed.

Barrios had been living in the streets in Los Angeles before he decided to go to Las Vegas. A friend of Barrios told The Post the 32-year old was a former stripper who mooched off men and women who had romantic interests in him."

The owner of the Pizza Hut master franchise in Israel since 2008 with a stint at Domino’s before that Shamai has a reputation for combining dough and cheese with software and hardware to help make that pizza taste even better – and to get it to your door with a minimum of human involvement.

Shamai is now digging deep into the dish with his latest startup Hyper Food Robotics which creates modular portable robotic pizza kitchens.

Robots in the kitchen? What was wrong with the old-fashioned way of preparing a pie? Shamai tells ISRAEL21c there are three problems.

First and foremost is cost. Staff comprises some 20% of the costs of running a pizza chain. Robots on the other hand never get sick and never need vacations or cigarette breaks. Replacing humans with robots will save Pizza Hut money. (Whether the retailer will pass that savings on to the consumer is another matter entirely.)

Second is safety: Robots don’t make mistakes. They don’t use ingredients that have passed their expiration dates and they never forget to wear their protective gloves while getting down and dirty with the dough. A self-contained “plug and play” robotic system can even monitor the air quality so everything stays hygienic.

Finally there’s consistency. A human worker may make a great pizza at the beginning of his or her shift but after eight hours a customer might get a sub-optimal pie.

Hyper’s solution is a 40-foot container fitted with easily configurable robots that can prepare the dough sprinkle the cheese toss on toppings and put the pie in the oven before transferring it to a warming box sliced and ready for delivery.

A pizza pro

In October Singapore-based travel and hospitality venture capital firm Velocity Ventures invested in Hyper which is expected to launch its first fully robotic pizza kitchens in 2023.

Hyper is focused on the US market Shamai notes but the Velocity investment should accelerate Hyper’s adoption in Southeast Asia.

Hyper is not Shamai’s first food-related startup. In 2014 he founded DragonTail a software system for optimizing the running of a fast-food restaurant. Precisely tracking orders and deliveries which seems so obvious in the age of DoorDash GrubHub and Wolt simply didn’t exist then.

DragonTail was acquired by Yum! Brands the parent company of Pizza Hut Taco Bell and KFC and now Dragontail’s order management and delivery technology is incorporated into 1500 Pizza Hut restaurants across about a dozen countries.

From dough to cleanup

When Shamai started Hyper he initially hoped to assemble the robotic kitchen from off-the-shelf parts but quickly realized that all the machines had to be proprietary.

Hyper cofounder and COO Yariv Reches engineered the system from scratch.

The robots can make 120 pizzas an hour about three times more than in a typical human-staffed kitchen. They use a patented method for stretching and rotating the dough and specially designed dispensers that pour exact amounts to avoid waste and uneven distribution.

The robot’s arms work with special conveyers to get the product from one station to the next.

“The robots move the pizza into the oven take it out cut the slices and put it in the box to be stored in a delivery cabinet” Reches continues.

“The delivery person finds what he’s looking for and can take drinks and salads out of the same cabinet.”

Hyper’s robots even take care of the cleanup. In the future Reches notes they could be programmed to do even more.

Although Hyper is not alone trying to automate fast-food operations Shamai says that “no one else is doing a full concept store. Some will just retrofit an existing store.”

He adds that whereas a conventional pizza shop generates about 14% profit Hyper can push that profit margin to 34%.

Ghost kitchens

Now don’t expect to walk into a next-generation Pizza Hut and see robots working in the back room.

Hyper is hyper-focused on the “ghost kitchen” a separate delivery-only location that’s often located in a less-trafficked industrial part of town Reches tells ISRAEL21c.

“When you order a pizza you don’t care how it’s made just that it comes on time it’s warm and tasty and safe to eat. We are ghosting the ghost kitchen.”

Shamai goes one step further.

“In a couple of years there won’t be one person working in the fast-food delivery business” he claims.

This also fits with Velocity’s investment philosophy. Velocity was established just as Covid-19 started.

“They wanted to find solutions to cope with this new world” Reches says. “There was no one available to work during Covid but everyone wanted to order pizza. They saw an opportunity – not just because of Covid. It also fits the problems and the pain this sector had.”

A fully robotic kitchen can even track supplies “so we always know when to order new tomato sauce or pepperoni” Reches says.

Pilots now bowls later

Hyper has been piloting its robotic kitchen in Israel with Pizza Hut and Yum! since 2021 and Shamai expects to robotize 10 existing Israeli pizza kitchens in 2025.

Meanwhile the company is starting trials with ghost kitchens in the United States and Asia. All that’s required is to hook up the container to electricity water and sewage.

Pizza Hut is on board naturally but Shamai emphasizes that “the process is the same whether it’s Pizza Hut or Domino’s. The difference is the dough the side dishes and the specific ingredients” Shamai says. In high tech lingo that means Hyper is brand agnostic.

Hyper will charge both a one-time setup fee and a percentage of sales. The stores’ operations can be remote-controlled from a central location.

Hyper’s 15 employees based in Petah Tikva are working on the next development:

Robotically prepared “bowl food” (stir fries poke bowls all kinds of Asian fast-food options) followed by burgers.

“Sixty percent of the functions we developed for pizza will move forward to the next type of store – even salad ice cream or Mexican food” Reches notes.

NATIONAL 2nd DECEMBER 2022 (GPN): Taking forward the brand’s commitment to nurture a community marked by Diversity Equity & Inclusion KFC India launched its most inclusive Special KFC restaurant in Amanora Mall Pune ahead of International Day of Persons with Disabilities. Operated by specially-abled team members elements at this Special KFC restaurant include infrastructural design accessibility & décor features to enhance customer experience & provide an inclusive environment.

The restaurant is an embodiment of the brand’s efforts with Kshamata – a program to bridge the gender & ability imbalance gap. With KFC Kshamata the brand has pledged to drive 2X empowerment by 2024 by doubling the number of Special KFCs restaurants run by specially-abled team members and increasing the women workforce at the restaurants.

The restaurant has been designed keeping accessibility at the core and majority of the décor features are in braille and sign language. All the signage outside & within the restaurant is accompanied by iterations in Indian Sign Language. This begins with the brand’s signature at the entrance where the iconic KFC is spelt in sign language as well as all areas within the restaurant including the ordering & pick-up section and digital kiosks. The restaurant also features a signature wall highlighting alphabets from A to Z in braille and Indian Sign Language to encourage patrons visiting the restaurant to learn and #SpeakSign. The seating arrangement within the restaurant has been created to accommodate wheelchairs at dine-in tables.

KFC India has been a pioneer in enabling the Speech & Hearing Impaired by extending employment & growth opportunities to them since 2008 employing & supporting more than 150 Speech & Hearing-Impaired team members across 19 cities. Recently the brand announced a milestone in their journey with Kshamata with the appointment of the first specially-abled Restaurant General Manager in Hyderabad – Srikanth Jarugu.

On International Day of Sign Languages 23rd September KFC launched the #SpeakSign campaign and Kshamata film – directed by filmmaker Shoojit Sircar which aims at sensitizing & building awareness of sign language. Earlier this year the brand also introduced braille menus across its 600+ restaurants in the country.

Taking the pledge beyond their restaurants KFC partnered with the Indian Deaf Cricket Association (IDCA) as ‘Principal Sponsor’ to build visibility and growth for the sport of cricket for the hearing impaired in the country.

With the peak shipping season approaching again many of these same issues— labor shortages a global pandemic and geopolitical crises—plus some new ones will challenge supply chain professionals once again. To prevent consumer disappointment this year businesses are seeking solutions that can minimize disruptions in their supply chains and ensure inventory is on shelves deliveries are made on time and more.

Location intelligence is a valuable tool for supply chain professionals as it provides insight into consumer movement patterns that can help companies better predict demand manage inventory identify potential bottlenecks and allocate staff. Below we’ll share some examples of how location intelligence can be used to minimize disruptions and keep supply chains running smoothly this holiday season.

Predicting consumer demand

It seems that the holiday shopping season starts earlier each year as consumers look to capitalize on early deals or spread out their shopping. The 2022 season has already begun as research shows that more than half of consumers have already started their holiday shopping. By combining historical datasets with recent foot traffic data retailers can determine any upticks in consumer demand in near real-time and adjust their strategies accordingly. For example if a big box retailer starts to see a significant increase in traffic at the end of October they can send more big-ticket items to their stores to keep up with demand and ensure popular items are well-stocked.

Inventory management

Having the right amount of inventory in the right places is key for winning the holiday shopping season. According to the National Retail Federation “overall holiday sales in November and December have averaged about 19% of annual retail sales over the last five years.” To maximize revenue in the all-important holiday season it’s important that businesses are properly stocked on popular items and are not at risk of product shortages. Utilizing location intelligence can provide greater visibility into the supply chain as it helps companies identify where demand is on the rise and where more product inventory might be needed. A company can then determine whether they need to reallocate a specific product shipment or cancel an order altogether so they don’t have excess inventory. This will free up space in warehouses and ensure a company is not wasting money by storing goods no one intends to purchase.

Similarly location intelligence can determine which stores in a network are seeing increases in traffic. Say a retailer’s stores in the Northeast are seeing a weekly uptick in people visiting their stores then that retailer can choose to send more inventory to stores in the Northeast for the short-term and adjust product supply at their warehouses in that area so they can maintain a steady stream of stock on shelves.

Identifying bottlenecks

When facing pressure to deliver packages on time during the holiday season supply chain professionals need to be able to identify potential bottlenecks that could cause severe delays. Location intelligence can provide added visibility into every tier of a company’s supply chain as it can pinpoint anomalies in foot traffic at warehouses manufacturing plants suppliers and other key locations. By measuring against a baseline level of foot traffic a retailer can detect irregularities in foot traffic which would alert them that they need to act quickly to mitigate the issue. For example a major winter storm closes the roads near a rural warehouse meaning employees can’t get to work to take in new shipments. Seeing this change in foot traffic a retailer can divert any new deliveries to another nearby warehouse while the roads get cleared. By utilizing location intelligence companies can get ahead of potential bottlenecks and lessen the impact felt by delays.

Getting staffing right

For many companies seasonal hiring is essential to their success during the holiday shopping season. Location intelligence can help companies determine where they need to allocate more employees or adjust hours. For example if a retailer is seeing a significant increase in foot traffic at some of its stores it can hire more staff or shift locations for existing employees to ensure that those stores are properly staffed. Once traffic decreases staff can adjust hours or return to their original store locations. Location intelligence can help companies determine how to properly manage staffing levels saving time and money.

The holidays can be a stressful time for everyone but this time can also present the ultimate sales and customer experience opportunity for retailers and other businesses. This year put the right strategies and technologies in place to gain more control within your supply chain.

Delivery robots have been spotted forming an orderly queue to use a pedestrian crossing - with one asking a passer-by to press the button for them.

Pictures showed The Starship Technologies food delivery robots patiently waiting to cross the road as part of its new trial in Cambridge this month.

Cyclist Naomi Davies spotted the group of robots on the pavement and said they waited for three light changes before one crossed the road.

While waiting in line one of the robots asked a woman to press the button for them. Starship said the robots were not 'shy' so were happy to ask strangers for help when they needed it.

Ms Davies who took the photos said there were seven robots in total two out of shot of the picture.

The machines look like small white plastic boxes mounted on six wheels kitted out with a bright orange flag that is lit up at night so motorists and pedestrians can see them while they trundles around.

She told the BBC: 'I thought the first one was going to go when the lights changed but it just started manoeuvring and shuffled about a bit and then stopped.

The Starship Technologies robots are being used at the moment in Cambridge as part of a trail between Cambridgeshire County Council and the Co-op to deliver groceries to 12000 residents in the city

'At one point a dog came by and one robot sort of lurched around the dog and then seemed to get stuck.

'One of the robots asked a lady if she would please press the button - I think she was rather surprised a robot was speaking to her.'

The cyclist waited for one robot to cross between Coleridge Road and Davy Road on Tuesday night but did not know how long the others took as it was cold and she wanted to get home.

The photo of the robots prompted many comments on Facebook with the majority of people asking how the squat robots are supposed to reach the button.

One said: 'I almost felt the need to get out of my car in order to trigger the traffic lights. Somehow they look so sad waiting on the kerb.'

Another asked: 'How do they trigger the traffic lights?'

Since the beginning of the trial sightings of the small machines have become more common amusing locals with their queuing system.

This is not the first trial of the Starship robot delivery service. During the pandemic the robots were used in Milton Keynes to deliver food to people during the coronavirus lockdown

One person claimed: 'I saw one of these travelling up our road on Saturday afternoon. A family had ordered a birthday cake for the dad and when the lid opened its lights came on and it played Happy Birthday to him.'

Another added: 'They live up in a unit behind the Vue Cinema area every night they take themselves home in a precession. quite funny to watch. I wonder if this was them starting their day.'

Others said the robots were 'cute' and that locals in Cambridge were resisting the temptations to 'stick googly eyes on them'.

The squat machienes travel on pavements and can reach speeds of 4mph. They are rain and snow proof

Even the animals do not appear to be frightened by them. One woman said: 'My dog loves them he thinks they’re dogs in disguise.'

The trial is currently taking place in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council and the Co-op with 12000 residents in 5000 homes getting deliveries from their local store.

They have previously been rolled out on to the streets of Cambourne Milton Keynes Northampton and Bedford.

Over the coronavirus lockdown the popularity of the knee-high robots in Milton Keynes surged. The robots even delivered food for free to NHS workers.

The trial is also set to take place for parts of Leeds with 20000 residents in Adel and Tinshill being able to order their groceries from nearby Co-op stores.

WHAT ARE STARSHIP TECHNOLOGIES' DELIVERY ROBOTS? The San Francisco-based company was created by Skype's Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis in 2014. The slow-moving delivery bots have already been operating across the world. They have travelled more than 100000 miles in testing mode in more than 100 cities in 20 different countries. Unlike robots designed to resemble humans Starship's bot is purely functional with a large compartment to hold deliveries the equivalent size of two grocery bags. Each six-wheeled 'ground drone' is completely self-driving. Workers can drop a pin on a map (like Uber) to show their location and then select what food they want to order. Each vehicle is 55cm (22 inches) high by 70cm (28 inches) long. It has a secured compartment where parcels with a maximum weight of 10kg (22 pounds) can be transported accessible to consumers via a link generated by a smartphone app. They have six wheels and can travel at speeds up to 4mph (6.4kmh) per hour. They travel mainly on pavements can go up curbs and operate in the rain and snow. The company has already been operating in a number of towns across England.

A spokesperson for Starship Technologies said: 'The robots make more than 140000 road crossings every day around the world nearly one every three seconds using a combination of sensors artificial intelligence and machine learning to safely navigate.

'Most of these crossings are done autonomously but on the rare occasion assistance is required the robots can be monitored remotely.

'It's also true that every now and then the robots are not shy in asking a friendly resident for help if they can't quite reach the button particularly in a new area they've recently started mapping.

'Although in some locations around the world now the robots can automatically 'talk' to the traffic light eliminating the need to press the button. But they're also very happy to wait in a queue - they are in England after all.'",,,,,,

The episode aired in April 2019.

Anna created Basepaw to have genetic testing for cats. All customers have to do to get their cats' DNA tested is to order the test take a fur sample and send ti back for testing. Anna has worked on four different start-ups before launching the DNA testing company in 2016 to make “the world better for cats (and their humans).""

Anna Skaya made an appearance on Shark Tank season 14's episode that aired on December 2 2022 to talk more about her company.

The synopsis of the episode read:

""Daniel Lubetzky guest sharks; a way to attract hummingbirds; easing anxiety with an entertaining product; a fire-defense system; a wearable fitness design makes it easier and faster to sweat; an update on Basepaws a pet genetic testing company.""

Zoetis acquired Basepaws four years after it appeared on Shark Tank

The start-up appeared on Shark Tank during season 10 and at the time it had already earned $100000 in revenue. The test cost $25 dollars to create and was sold for $95.

However at the time it only had DNA testing that was able to help pet parents find out what diseases their cats could get. The testing kit included another feature that now enables the company to form a database of all cats to further identity future traits or diseases and comes with health markers.

The Shark Tank company took it a step forward in terms of feline healthcare and introduced new products that have contributed towards finding solutions to cat diabetes and cat cancer. In July 2022 Basepaws was acquired by Zoetis Inc.

Kristin Peck Zoetic’s CEO spoke about the acquisition and said that when they met Skaya and her team the company was drawn to their passion for pets. Peck added that they were interested to see the role that genetic testing and data analytics have on advancing animal care.

They further stated that the addition would enhance their precision in the animal health space and help in their future petcare innovations. Together the companies can provide more comprehensive solutions to manage the health wellness and quality of care of animals.

Basepaws’ on Shark Tank

Anna appeared on Shark Tank season 10 episode 21 seeking $250000 for a 5% stake in her company. Shark Lori asked why the test was cat-specific and Anna explained that she plans on introducing a test for canines the following year.

O’Leary asked her about the costs and margins and Anna explained that each unit costs $25 to make and is sold for $95. She said that her company has been available for over 10 months and generated over $200000 in gross revenue.

Kevin was the first Shark to make her an offer of $250000 for an 8.3% stake plus 1.7% in advisory shares which brought the company's value to $3 million. Eventually Kevin and Robert worked on a deal of $250000 for 10% together which Anna accepted.",,,,,,,,,,,,
